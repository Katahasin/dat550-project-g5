On February 3, 1943, the SS Dorchester was torpedoed by a German submarine. These four chaplains calmed the troops and helped organize the evacuation into life boats. When they ran out of life jackets to hand out, they removed their own life jackets and gave them to others.

When everything possible had been done, the chaplains linked arms, saying prayers and singing hymns as they sank with the ship. Survivors could hear prayers in different languages, including Hebrew prayers from the rabbi and Latin prayers from the Catholic priest. 

Grady Clark, a survivor, said, ""As I swam away from the ship, I looked back. The flares had lighted everything. The bow came up high and she slid under. The last thing I saw, the Four Chaplains were up there praying for the safety of the men. They had done everything they could. I did not see them again.

Instead, these politicians are consumed with consolidating their own power on Capitol Hill and silencing opponents who dare to challenge their ironfisted rule.

Indeed, time and again they have delivered victory after victory for Obama and his radical agenda -- from spending, borrowing, and Obamacare to illegal immigration, Iran and ""trade"" power. Never before has a Congress controlled by one party been so thoroughly impotent. This is due to the disastrous leadership of McConnell and Boehner.
