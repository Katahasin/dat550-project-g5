Unfortunately, the government and mainstream media have not only failed to educate the public about vaccines, but actively work to keep knowledge about the subject from us by attacking anyone who dares to question public vaccine policy.

There's a whole world of information out there about vaccines that most people just aren't exposed to. If you care about this subject, here's a great opportunity to gain more knowledge to help you make an educated choice for your family.

Starting April 12, a new 7-part docu-series called The Truth About Vaccines will be available to watch free online. They've got a great lineup of experts who will explore this subject and share their knowledge. Don't miss it!

Then he closes by saying that by appealing to the ICC, the Palestinians are ""doing it the Zionist way"". 

No, Peter. Appealing to the international community and international law are not ""the Zionist way"". 

The Zionist way was to ethnically cleanse Palestine of 750,000 of its inhabitants to further the racist goal of establishing a ""Jewish state"" in its place. 

The Zionist way has been to try to brutalize and oppress the Palestinians into submission to cement their gains, such as their illegally-constructed colonies in the West Bank, or simply to punish them for existing, as with their longstanding policy of collectively punishing the entire civilian population of Gaza.

No, Peter, what the Palestinians are doing is nothing at all like the Zionist way. It is pretty much the opposite of that.
