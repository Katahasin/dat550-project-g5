POSCO Withdraws: The Victory No One is Celebrating
by Subhash Gatade

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/03/28/posco-withdraws-the-victory-no-one-is-celebrating/

Big news – at times – go completely unnoticed. (Thanks to the mediatised times we are passing through) And thus it did not appear surprising that the decision by Posco, the South Korean steelmaker, the fourth biggest in the world, to exit the proposed 12 million-tonnes a year steel plant in Odisha did not cause much flutter. Yes, newspapers duly reported POSCO India's 'request to the Odisha government to take back the land provided to it near Paradip' where it was supposed to invest 52,000 croreRs.' The letter stated company's 'failure to start work on the proposed plant'.

Our struggles won't go in vain. We shall fight and we shall win.

The protest against the Trump administration's policy of rounding up of immigrants is growing in USA. The weekend protests drew large crowds especially in Raleigh, North Carolina.

U.S Navy Seal's killed 8 year old Nawar in Yemen. What prompted the soldier to point his weapon at Nawar and squeeze the trigger, fully aware that he was murdering in cold blood an innocent child? Was he following the Commander-in-Chief's prescription for winning the so-called ""war on terror? It's a chilling story. 

What would the dead say if they could speak from the grave? Over 100 people, mostly youngsters, were killed in Kashmir this summer. Basharat Shameem tells the story of Zubair Ahmad Khanday who was one of the first to be killed in the aftermath of the Burhan Wani killing.

I started a Facebook page some time back called ""Life in India is cheap,DAMN CHEAP"". It was started after seeing a death defying circus performance, also prompted by my experience of living in India for 46 years. https://www.facebook.com/groups/501753966699821/ The Zapatista Sub-Commandate Marcos, used to say life in Chiapas is a miracle. Death is a constant companion in Chiapas. So is the case in many of the villages in India. Yes, Life in India is cheap, DAMN CHEAP. In the latest of such stories come from Chingudipala Panchayat of Sukinda block in Jajpur district, Odisha where 19 children have died of malnutrition. 

Did you ever think that a small action from our part can save lives? Rachel Olivia O'Connor reminds of this fact. She writes "" If we do manage to focus primarily on saving others' lives, not catering on automatic to our own habits, the life we save may be our own.""

Also many stories from around the world on a variety of topics.

Thousands Demonstrate In Defense Of Immigrants As White House Vows More Deportations
by Tom Eley 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/02/13/thousands-demonstrate-in-defense-of-immigrants-as-white-house-vows-more-deportations/

Demonstrations in the US continued over the weekend against last week's mass roundup of immigrants, the first ""surge"" in deportations since President Donald Trump signed a January 25 executive order dramatically expanding the purview of anti-immigrant police actions. An annual march for civil rights in Raleigh, North Carolina, held Saturday, drew a record crowd of over 20,000. The turnout was fueled by opposition to Trump's brutal policies against both Hispanic and Muslim immigrants.

Death Of Nawar al-Awlaki
by George Capaccio

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/02/13/death-of-nawar-al-awlaki/

How did Nawar al-Awlaki,an 8-year-old child, die at the hands of a Navy Seal during last month's night time raid in Yemen?  We know from credible reports that she was shot in the neck at close range and received no medical aid throughout the remaining two hours of her life.

My name is Zubair Ahmad Khanday. I am now a resident of the immortal world. In the mortal world, my address happened to be Kulpora, Kulgam, in the now fermented South Kashmir.

The Life You Save

Something Is Happening
by William Hawes

Something is happening here, but you don't know what it is: Do you?  No one knows, really, as this something is still evolving.  As we look back to 2016, though, it is abundantly clear that history has awoken from its slumber. We've had a couple events in the West last year: Brexit and Trump

Is Rising Inequality A Failure Of U.S. Democracy?
 by Dr Arshad M Khan

It is a conceit of democracy that opposing parties, after months of trying to convince the public the other would be a disaster for the country, should after the election cooperate for the good of the whole

Bungling In Yemen: Trump And The Cult Of The Action Hero
by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/02/13/bungling-in-yemen-trump-and-the-cult-of-the-action-hero/

The seething bickering in Washington has been going on for over a week. Was the first authorised international raid by the Trump administration, supposedly made over dinner, a success?  There was little denying that the  bells and blood Yemen mission in Bayda province last month was spectacularly deadly, costing the life of a US serviceman, twenty five civilians including nine children and eight women – in addition to al-Qaeda operatives

The Dworkin-MacKinnon Anti-Pornography Civil Rights Ordinance

The Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance — originally written in 1983 by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon — was an amendment to a civil rights law. It stands as a mostly ignored template for creating law-based change within the system.

Softening-Up The UK Public For GM: Monsanto And Former UK Civil Servant Deal In PR, Not Science And Objective Debate

It is not surprising that Monsanto is preparing a fresh effort to try to soften up the UK public for GM food appearing on supermarket shelves and GM crops being planted in the nation's fields. Former World Bank communications strategist and slick communicator Vance Crowe has been hired by Monsanto as its 'Director of Millenial Engagement' to convince younger people about the benefits of GM. And he is visiting the UK to give a series of talks.

Iranian Filmmaker Asghar Farhadi's The Salesman
by Tom Carter

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/02/13/iranian-filmmaker-asghar-farhadis-the-salesman/

The film is remarkable and rich, the kind of experience you turn over in your mind for days afterwards, discovering new facets that reflect new themes or ideas. Above all, the film affirms the essential humanity of every person—even and especially the ""villain""—and exposes the emptiness and absurdity of revenge-taking.

A Wish For Peace
 by Ravi Nitesh 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/02/13/a-wish-for-peace/

Despite being globally connected over internet, an experience of visiting the other side is still a dream for an ordinary Indian and Pakistani. Internet can obviously provide much knowledge and can help in strengthening bond through sharing talks and laughs, emotions but relaxing visa formalities, starting tourist visas may help people in smelling the soil, touching the shrines and temples and realizing a dream through their own eyes. It may not only help in bringing future revenues to governments, instead it would be a linkage of believing in each other and walking on the path of cordial relations together and forever.

""Ezra"" – A Reincarnation Of 'Dybbuk' Movies From The West
 by K M Seethi  

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/02/13/ezra-a-reincarnation-of-dybbuk-movies-from-the-west/

""Ezra"" can also be seen as an addition to the typical judeophobiac tradition of 'horror' movies where the 'Jewish evilness' is dreadfully caricatured, by both Christian and Islamic traditions.  Dr. Mikel Koven has done many studies about it in the past showing the ethnocentrism of such movies. Let us be more careful in our understating that Jews are not the problem of this world and they are not here to end the world. The problem is more of our mode of understanding our problems. Hopefully, 'Ezra' will not emerge as a movie in judeophobiac tradition of 'horror' because Kerala has had an excellent, assorted tradition of coexistence of different religious communities, extended over a two millennia.

 It's inauguration day of the commander in chief of THE EMPIRE. And what an emperor we've got! As Richard Heinberg says in his article ""  Inauguration Day: A Good Day For A Walk In The Woods"" - ""In my view, the most revealing personal characteristic of president #45 may be his complete disconnection from the natural world. Here is an individual who grew up in a city, who sees land only in terms of profit potential, who proudly covers the tortured ground with high-rise buildings, who lives in a penthouse, and who walks outdoors only on golf courses. One could make some similar comments about many of his recent predecessors (certainly not Teddy Roosevelt), but in this instance the tendency reaches an extreme."" On this inauguration day, we may take a walk in the park like Heinberg suggests, hug a tree or hold some mud in your hand and weep. 

The ever sagacious John Avery warns against despair and reminds us of the responsibility of each one of us in a world where many governments today  may be described unjust, and some that even deserve to be called fascist. Avery delves into the thoughts of Thoreau, Tolstoy, Gandhi and Martin Luther King reminds of our responsibility in the present world drawing inspiration from these trailblazers. Avery also says Nuremberg Principles can also guide us. 

There is some good news in all this gloom and doom. ""UK Wind Generated More Electricity Than Coal In 2016""!

Well, it's indeed is a good news, but we must take it with a pinch of salt. Will green energy sustain our current level of consumption? Gunnar Rundgren warns us in his article ""Reducing Consumption And Local Exchange Better Than ""Sustainable Consumption"""".  He writes ""While it is clear that global trade play a major role as a driver of destruction of biodiversity there is no way ""consumers"" in the US or other developed economies can be expected to take responsibility for the effect on biodiversity of their consumption. It is a tall order even for the companies trading or the retailers selling the products. Citizens should rather take responsibility by a general reduction in consumption, by favoring local goods exchange and relationships and by opposing policies that further drive international trade.""

Emily Spence throws in another gem from CC archives. ""The Economic And Social Losses On The Way"" published on 29 April, 2011. Well the role of CC is connecting the dots. People like Emily has helped a lot in our endeavour. As Emily writes in this article, you walk into a super-sized mall and see all the 'stuff' in shiny, happy wrappers. Do you actually realize that you are actually walking into a graveyard! Emily writes so eloquently ""They can't look at cotton goods or food and imagine the huge oceanic dead zones and the annihilation of many diverse organisms caused by farm runoff. They can't go to the paper isle and picture that, aside from all of the multitudes of items derived from timber, U.S. toilet paper use alone destroys thirteen million acres of forests per year, along with all life dependent on those forests. "" Did anything change since 2011? On this inauguration day it's only going to get worse! http://www.countercurrents.org/spence290411.htm

Perhaps, after all we may  not be 'fake news' peddlers as WashPo and other great truth tellers suggest! I would rather be happy if CC is proved wrong on all counts than see my son and his sons/daughters swept away by the storms of our grandchildren as James Hansen wrote so powerfully in his book. 

And also more stories from around the world.

 Inauguration Day: A Good Day For A Walk In The Woods
 by Richard Heinberg 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/01/20/inauguration-day-a-good-day-for-a-walk-in-the-woods/

How can a person so isolated from natural phenomena hope to understand the vulnerability of our planet's climate, water, air, and innumerable species to the actions of people (one hastens to add—people much like himself)? How can he appreciate that civilization itself is an organism with a constant need for ""food"" (not just grain and meat, but energy, minerals, and water as well), that is organized by way of hierarchically ordered and interlinked cycles, and that is subject to natural limits and ultimately to death?

Individual Responsibility
 by John Scales Avery

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/01/20/individual-responsibility/

There are many governments today that can be described unjust, and some that even deserve to be called fascist. What is the duty of the individual citizen, living under such a government? What was the duty of a German, living under Hitler? The thoughts of Thoreau, Tolstoy, Gandhi and Martin Luther King can help us answer this question. The Nuremberg Principles can also help us to answer it.

UK Wind Generated More Electricity Than Coal In 2016
 by Simon Evans  

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/01/20/uk-wind-generated-more-electricity-than-coal-in-2016/

The milestone is a first for the UK and reflects a collapse in coal generation, which contributed just 9.2% of UK electricity last year, with 11.5% from wind. The coal decline saw its output fall to the lowest level since 1935. It also means CO2 emissions from UK power generation will have fallen by around 20% in 2016, as coal was largely replaced by lower-emissions gas. This reduction will be enough to cut overall UK CO2 emissions by 6% for the year, if other sectors' emissions are unchanged.

The Economic And Social Losses On The Way
By Emily Spence

http://www.countercurrents.org/spence290411.htm

At present, numerous environmental researchers are warning of future resource shortages. The list of them is large and includes water, oil, a variety of minerals and metals, as well as other materials. Yet, most people carry on as if they do not hear the message at all. They refuse to cut back in their dreams of continuing economic growth. In relation, part of the problem with them is perhaps an inability to make connections. For the most part, they seem to have little or no idea about the collective consequences of their individual behaviors.

Reducing Consumption And Local Exchange Better Than ""Sustainable Consumption""

While it is clear that global trade play a major role as a driver of destruction of biodiversity there is no way ""consumers"" in the US or other developed economies can be expected to take responsibility for the effect on biodiversity of their consumption.

A Look At What Works And — And Doesn't — In The World Of Conservation
 by Haley Madderom 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/01/20/a-look-at-what-works-and-and-doesnt-in-the-world-of-conservation/

What Works in Conservation 2017, a free online book just published by University of Cambridge conservation specialists, aims to help conservation workers navigate that sea. With the guidance of an international team of experts, the book summarizes, organizes and evaluates the outcomes of specific conservation practices reported in more than 150 scientific journals as well as in unpublished reports and other literature from around the world. By providing detailed information on various practices and outcomes, it attempts to answer the questions: What worked? What looked promising, but didn't end up making a difference in the long haul? What actually ended up doing more harm than good? And in what context?

U.S. Senators Are Even More Neoconservative Than Are Trump's Appointees

The confirmation hearings for the members of incoming President Donald Trump's national-security team showed that neoconservatism dominates the U.S. government today: neoconservatism didn't end after George W. Bush's alleged certainty that ""Saddam's WMD"" existed in 2002

Myanmar: A scribe's Murder And Its Aftermath
 by Nava Thakuria

Ko Soe Moe Tun (35), a Monywa (Sagaing) based Burmese journalist was found dead on 13 December 2016, who was convincingly targeted for his extensive investigation & coverage on the wood smuggling, illegal logging and mining in northwest Myanmar. The reporter, engaged with Daily Eleven newspaper, published by the Yangon based Eleven Media Group, also posted few details in his facebook account about the people involved with the illegal timber trades.

TOI Editorial On Indian Newspaper Industry Smells Like Match-Fixing
 by M J Pandey 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/01/20/toi-editorial-on-indian-newspaper-industry-smells-like-match-fixing/

With reference to the unsigned editorial 'Indian Newspaper industry: Red Ink splashed across the bottom line' (TOI, Jan 19, 2017), a case is being made out for concessions to the newspaper industry on the grounds that it is in the doldrums and is beleaguered by various burdens, including that of wage board wages, GST, DAVP, etc. Without mentioning the recent illegal closure of six editions of The Hindustan Times as the obvious peg for this, the editorial seeks a range of concessions – from a part-discontinuance of the wage board for newspaper employees, to subsidies on advertising and tax.

81307324765_10154962486344766,"Dear Friend,

 The Senate Armed Services Committee gave near-unanimous approval Wednesday to Donald Trump's choice to head the Pentagon, voting by 26-1 to approve retired Gen. James ""Mad Dog"" Mattis as the next secretary of defense. The unanimity of Democratic support for Trump's national security nominees demonstrates the real nature of the transition from the Obama administration to the Trump administration. Whatever their political differences, the Democrats and Republicans are united in their allegiance to the military-intelligence apparatus of US imperialism.

For the third year in a row, the world experienced its warmest year on the books, global scientists have determined. The new assessments come from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the UK's Met Office, as well as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which relies in part on data from those agencies. The findings also back up the declaration made earlier this month by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.

Countercurrents calls our era 'our Titanic Moment'. The travellers in the Titanic didn't know their fate until the last moment and then it was too late. What CC tries to do is to make sure that  humanity should not be caught unawares when 'Mother Ship Earth' hits  a rock in our 'icefree' voyage to the future. There are three events that can sink our mother ship earth and destroy most of humanity or even all species on earth. 1. Climate Change. The last three years were historically the warmest years on record and it's not an anomaly. It's a historic trend and we have only a short window of time to save our ship. 2. Peak Oil. We know that the earth  does not have infinite resources. The most abundantly used resources now are water and oil. Water is renewable. Oil is not. There is a point in time when oil production will hit a plateau and start declining. According to International Energy Agency that point reached in 2006. This graph was buried in the 2010 World Energy Outlook report prepared by that agency http://globalchangewatch.weebly.com/uploads/5/7/2/1/5721491/904992473.jpg?719. If the conventional oil peaked in 2006 or so, why do we have cheap oil? That question has put Peak Oil off headlines. The answer  may be summed up as, due to environmentally destructive fracking technology and tar sands mining in North America and the global economic slow down! That doesn't mean that the crisis has gone away. It may have been postponed for  a few years. CC has published hundreds of articles on the subject. Interested readers can read it here . https://www.google.co.in/search?q=peak+oil&domains=http://www.countercurrents.org&sitesearch=http://www.countercurrents.org&btnG=Search&gws_rd=cr&ei=avaAWKS_H4vvvgT1hr2IAw
And the third danger is Nuclear war. Climate Change or Peak Oil can lead to a thermonuclear war as it start playing out in real life situations. 

I'm writing all this as my friend Emily Spence reminded me of an article she wrote on 10 April, 2010 titled, ""Peak Oil: Are We Heading Towards Social Collapse?"" The article is as relevant as it was originally published. She concluded the article thus ""With the current peak-oil interval, we have a grace period when oil is still fairly inexpensive and abundant. At the same time, we cannot expect our government leaders to help society transition off of heavy oil dependence on account of their being controlled by ""big business"" interests. Therefore, it is up to average citizens to create the reforms that lead into localized economic and social development. If the enterprise is not actively taken in a timely fashion, the resultant chaos, as pointed out by Dmitry Orlov in The Five Stages Of Collapse, will be unavoidable.""

If We're Honest, We All Know Trump's America
 by Robert Jensen

While Trump deserves to be harshly critiqued, we should not pretend that he and his supporters are an aberration. When during the campaign President Obama said of Trump, ""That's not the America I know,"" my response was: Trump and his supporters, like it or not, represent ideas at the core of the America that we all know, if we are willing to be honest. Trump articulates ideas that are closer to what is considered ""normal"" in the United States than many of us are willing to acknowledge.

Scoundrels Of Patriotism: The Freeing Of Chelsea Manning

In the scheme of things, it is probably best to stay faithful to friends and fashioned principles than brutally abstract states, with policies written in water in the name of the national interest.  To interpret, in other words, that national interest, is to give form to a shape shifting aberration. How best to be a scoundrel in patriotism remains a near impossible question to answer. Manning, at least, came closer to a better response than most.

My friend's son had an accident the other day. I met him in the hospital. The accident was very bad. He had a head injury. The battle was between life and death. He had to be taken to a specailist hospital some 100 KM away. Although, my friend was a businessman, at that moment he had no cash with him. Going to the bank and standing in the queue was not an option. He tried to borrow money from the entire village. No body had cash. Fortunately, a small enterprise owner in the nearby village who had saved some money for his wife's delivery lent him the money and the boy's life was saved. 

Dear friends, a life or death battle is going on India, especially in rural India. It's a battle not just to save lives, but also for the dignity of lives. At least dignity in death. It is also a battle for our democracy. I see lethargy and apathy all around me.  Is there any outrage? Is there any anger? Or am I over reacting? Am I becoming paranoid?  I think it's time we left everything we are doing right now and fight the 'demon' of demonisation. This demon has no political affiliations. It will devour the hard core hindutva supporters too. It's high time they too realised that. 

Vandana Shiva sees demonetisation as the advent of digital dictatorship. She writes, ""imposing the digital economy through a ""cash ban"" is a form of technological dictatorship, in the hands of the world's billionaires."" http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/01/03/demonetisation-beware-of-digital-dictatorship/

Demonetisation: Beware Of Digital Dictatorship
by Vandana Shiva 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/01/03/demonetisation-beware-of-digital-dictatorship/

It already is one digital dictatorship. And we need to be asking far more questions than we are asking. We have blindly elevated means — which should be democratically chosen — into an end unto themselves. Money and tools are means, they need to be utilised with wisdom and responsibility to higher ends such as the protection of nature, the wellbeing of all and the common good.

Before the Standing Rock Sioux's historic protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline (NODAPL) fades from the world's collective memory – and the next tumultuous phase begins for the world to continue to address Climate Change and how to more quickly convert from fossil fuels to renewable energies – it's essential to pause and reconsider what exactly happened during the closing months of 2016 that the Sioux peoples NODAPL Protest raged and what this arduous historical journey Back to the Future signifies for us all.

Standing Rock: A Template For Resistance
by Mara Ahmed 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/01/03/standing-rock-a-template-for-resistance/

After 38 hours of being on the move, driving straight from Bismarck to Rochester, contending with three different snowstorms, and maneuvering scantily plowed roads and closed highways, we got back home to New York. The trip itself became an important lesson for us. It taught us that sharing everything and living by consensus decision-making can be hard. It requires patience and frequent negotiation, but it can be done. Maybe it's a model that's less clean-cut, more time consuming, and seemingly less efficient, in corporate parlance, but in the end we were richer for it and more equally served by it. Isn't that what democracy should be all about?

Do everything possible to deter offspring from becoming part of the wars we're waging? Maybe making regular use of alternative news sources would be a good idea too.

The data coming out show that India's demonetisation experiment is a failure and shrinking the Indian economy. The Nikkei/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.6 in December from November's 52.3. It was also the biggest month-on-month decline since November 2008, just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a financial crisis and brought on a global recession. It's the first realistic data of the impact of November 7 announcement of the banning of Rs 1000, and Rs 500 notes. I wonder if this data really shows the plight of rural India. Reports coming from rural India paints a much darker picture. 

Norbert Häring a well respected German business journalist argues in his article ""A well-kept open secret: Washington is behind India's brutal experiment of abolishing most cash"" that Indian demonetisation drive is an experiment hatched in Washington. I don't agree with some of the conclusions of the article, however, it's packed with a lot of facts.

This New Year's Eve, 750 heavy wooden crosses were distributed to a gathering of Chicagoans commemorating the victims of gun violence killed in 2016. Rev. Michael Pfleger and the Faith Community of St. Sabina Parish had issued a call to carry crosses constructed by Greg Zanis. The crosses, uniform in size, presented the name and age and, in many cases, a facial photo of the person killed. Some who carried the crosses were relatives of the people killed. As the group assembled, several sobbed upon finding the crosses that bore the names and photos of their loved ones.

Whether it's Afghanistan, Chechnya, Bosnia, Libya or Syria, the same playbook has been executed to the letter.

As India's demonetisation enters 52nd day, and also the promised 50 day window of Prime Minister Narendra Modi  has passed, things are not getting any better. There is no cash in ATMs, long queues still continue. More than that many people have nothing to withdraw from ATMs! The worst hit are farmers. Moin Qazi tells the plight of farmers in his article ""Farmers Continue To Suffer Pains Of Demonetisation"". Farmers are dumping onions and tomatos on the road. Whatever they can sell, they are selling  at throw away prices, as the accompanying video from ABP News shows. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/30/farmers-continue-to-suffer-pains-of-demonetisation/

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to address the nation tomorrow. Perhaps he would announce some sops to win votes in the upcoming elections. They may divert the public anger and even may please some people for some time. But the pain of demonetisation is not going to go away any time soon. 

As the year draws to a close, Sarah van Gelder looks back at 2016, and sees some positives. She closes the article with this advice ""We are living on a planet with a carbon-saturated atmosphere, in a time of increasing inequality and terrifying violence. Trump's administration won't get us where we need to go, but neither would the Democratic Party's corporate-friendly policies. So, even as we enter a time that could be quite dark, we should focus not on finding a way back to an Obama/Clinton past, but on how to move forward by nurturing the seeds of real change that began to germinate in 2016.""

Donald Trump's election was a wake up call. Ron Forthofer, a retired Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, Texas says, the Trump nightmare is nothing new. It has been going on for many decades. Many people chose not to wake up to the reality. Now that Trump is here it's time for action. He concludes the article ""If the message of 'peace on earth' is to have any meaning, all people must realize that the 'others' are fellow human beings whose lives have the same value as ours.""

Advocate Shalini Gera and her colleagues of JagLAG who were in Jagdalpur in connection with a case of false encounter of a young Adivasi boy (1), were confronted on the night of 27 December by a police team which entered the dharamshala where they were staying and accused them of trying to exchange demonetised notes on behalf of the Maoists. Despite the fact that they were following up on an order by the Chhattisgarh HC for exhumation and a second post-mortem in the case and their accommodation had been arranged by the office of the Divisional Commissioner, Adv Shalini and her colleagues were ordered to come to the police station for interrogation. Attempts were also made to forcibly search their rooms and belongings. When asked to produce a warrant, the SI in charge of the team became even more aggressive and abusive. It took a personal call from the Divisional Commissioner to the SI to force the police to back off.

The Case Against Aadhaar
by Viswanath L 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/30/the-case-against-aadhaar/

The Aadhaar programme proposes to set up technological barriers to the commission of fraud, but takes no responsibility towards the identity crisis it may cause to bona fide citizens. The big data it generates, together with the continuous collection of citizens' biometric data,is a frontal attack on the future of civil liberties in our country. On these counts the Aadhaar programme should be scrapped ab initio.The Aadhaar Act, which provides a semblance of legality to it, actually exposes the unviability of the underlying technology in the clearest possible terms and should help the Supreme Court in concluding the matter at the earliest.

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/30/shivaji-statue-why-important-for-hindutva-brigade/

The Hindutva advocates see in Shivaji a symbolism for promoting their concept of Hindu Rashtra through propagation of anti-minority attitude. Statue remains a means for reinforcing this mindset and promoting Hindutva.

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/30/kashmir-2016-the-year-of-unrest-is-fading-out/

As 2016 draws to a close and we move into 2017 – the start of a new year. It is that time of the year, when you get to look back with the mixed feelings on what you did and what you missed out on. No wonder, you didn't do anything significant this year, like winning some tournament, or a gold medal in the academics. As Kashmir dealt with the worst kind of an outbreak (which was a new season) of unrest in six years.

My Romance With A Village Postman
 by Moin Qazi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/30/my-romance-with-a-village-postman/

When I write this diary I feel extremely dismayed with the way the Indian village postman has receded into the far horizons of the rural landscape .The traditional postman has been slowly consigned to grandma's folklores and lullaby tales  . But it is an image that just won't get washed away by the driftwood of history. The image will keep revisiting us.

Despite the fact that they were following up on an order by the Chhattisgarh HC for exhumation and a second post-mortem in the case and their accommodation had been arranged by the office of the Divisional Commissioner, Adv Shalini and her colleagues were ordered to come to the police station for interrogation. Attempts were also made to forcibly search their rooms and belongings. When asked to produce a warrant, the SI in charge of the team became even more aggressive and abusive. It took a personal call from the Divisional Commissioner to the SI to force the police to back off.

It is day 51 of India's 'demonetisation'. The Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked for 50 days of patience from Indian citizens. He had said that if demonetisation drive fails in these 50 days people can punish him. Now, the 50 days are over. Latest tax figures show that the economic activities shrank to alarming level. It is reflected in the sufferings of the people. More than a hundred people have died. (You'll never know the exact figures).  Farmers don't get good price for their produce. They can't plant. Many are going hungry. Many are not going to hospitals even when they are sick. People have to beg for money. Famine stares straight into the face of every Indian. It's time of reckoning for Modi. Will he accept that his reckless monetary misadventure failed, as he promised? Will he take punishment as he promised? What punishment? As an elected representative, his responsibility is to accept that he failed peoples hopes and wrecked havoc on ordinary people's lives and take the only option before him. RESIGN. Will he do that? Will Indian people stand up and ask Modi to take the punishment?

As the Sun Sets On The Nuclear Wasteland
 by Vincent Di Stefano 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/29/as-the-sun-sets-on-the-nuclear-wasteland/

The ruinous consequences of seventy years of nuclearisation are now patently manifest. The Hanford facility in the U.S., Sellafield in the U.K. and the Mayak Industrial Complex in the former Soviet Union have all served as ""sacrifice zones"" where plutonium pits were manufactured for deployment in nuclear warheads during the Cold War era. They are now vast nuclear wastelands with unthinkable quantities of radioactive wastes stored in ageing containers and leaking landfill sites. Less visibly, countless abandoned uranium mines throughout the world continue to release radioactivity into the air, soil, local waterways and groundwater.

A Palestinian friend, Jafar Ramini, who is a refugee from Jenin and a highly respected writer, commentator and analyst on the Middle East wrote to me pointing out the prodigious flaw in Res. 2234 that I failed to mention

Phantom Democracy In The Age Of The Internet
by Nozomi Hayase 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/29/phantom-democracy-in-the-age-of-the-internet/

American democracy is hollowed out, veiled with a loud media echo chamber, bringing feigned solidity to its emptiness. Out of this vacuum emerges a madness for power. U.S. politics is a contest of those who are driven by insatiable hunger – the most callous, cunning and manipulative people in society.

The Dark Colors Of The Times

Every generation feels that it's living through the worst of times. As do the ones now that are occupying Earth for fleeting moments, as is the eternal law. In times like the present, obviously, there are more than only a couple reasons for conditions to look as dismal as they do. And those are mighty substantive reasons too. The ongoing deaths and destructions are way over the top to make reasonable people feel sick to the stomach, as the phrase states. And clearly the tragedy is colossal because the deaths and destructions continue unabated.

Gated Communities, Cars And Black Money
 by Vidyadhar Date 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/29/gated-communities-cars-and-black-money/

The Prime Minister is very upbeat about efficiency in bringing about a cashless society. Why does he not show any concern for efficiency in our transport system and on our roads ? An MLA and a builder of his party in fact wants to convert a lovely walking path , lined with trees,in Malabar Hill in Mumbai, into a motorable road. That is the commitment of the party to common people. Depriving them of even existing facilities and imposing more hardships on them by pampering the car lobby. Just to put the record straight the Congress has been equally guilty on this score.

We also strongly object to the way Sukma Police foisted false cases against the Fact Finding team members under Sections 8(1),(2) (3)and (5) of the Chhattisgarh State Public Security Act. All the members of the Fact Finding Team are activists of democratic mass organizations and they have been in public life for three decades in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

After The Storm, A Tornado?
by Mohammad Ashraf 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/29/after-the-storm-a-tornado/

Normally, after the abating of the storm one would have expected the Central Government to extend fullest support to the State Government to ameliorate the storm damages by way of full assistance in day to day problems including the worst power scenario, dilapidated roads,and general economic losses and so on. They should have been in addition, trying their best to open an unconditional dialogue with all the sections of the society. However, on the contrary for their short term gains in the forthcoming elections, they are creating conditions for a real twister to hit the state soon which may suck everything in! SARFAESI and WPRs may be the trigger for that!

He is president of the American Friends of Bet El Yeshiva and Bet El Institutions, raising money to support settlers.

Is UN Security Council Resolution 2334 The Beginning Of The End For Apartheid Israel?
 by Dr Gideon Polya

Resolution 2334 (2016) of the UN Security Council could have been stronger by condemning the Occupation but it nevertheless condemned other Israeli crimes in the Palestinian Territory that are in gross violation of international law,   and was passed 14-0 on 23 December 2016,  with the racist, pro-Zionist, pro-Apartheid US Obama Administration remarkably failing to veto and recording an unprincipled abstention. Hopefully UNSC Resolution 2334 is the beginning of the end for Apartheid and Apartheid Israel.

There is no doubt that the UN Security Council condemnation of Israel on Friday, December 23, was an important and noteworthy event. In fact, unlike the December 23 resolution 2334, the past UN condemnations were far stronger – for some resolutions did not just demand an immediate halt of illegal Jewish settlement construction, but the removal of existing settlements as well.

Dangal presents a 'limited' version of women empowerment whose protagonist is a patriarch. Namrata Joshi aptly describes this in her Review featured in The Hindu on Thursday. She describes Mahavir of Dangal as ""A patriarch who may seem rigid, unbending and dictatorial; whose ways may seem to cause immediate pain and discomfort but ensure a happy future for the daughters (and the nation) in the long run."" But not a 'patron' for women empowerment.

Disability is both a cause and consequence of poverty. Poor people are more likely to become differently abled and people with disabilities are among the poorest and most vulnerable group of population mainly due to the lack of access to education, skills and employment opportunities.

Russia, Iran And Turkey issued the ""Moscow Declaration"" which  declared the three countries' support for ""the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic,"" while affirming that ""there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict."" This declaration may send shock waves through the western capitals. 

However a question arises,  the three parties who issued this declaration, are they paragons of virtue? Franklin Lamb who reports from Syria says No, they are not. He depicts the sufferings of millions of Syrians through the story of Madaya Siblings ,Manal And Mohammed-Kamal, who were separated from their family due to the civil war in Syria. He says there is glaring proxy politics being played out in Syria. 

The Berlin Christmas market terror attack was a terrible tragedy. Now the right-wing has seized upon this opportunity to unleash an anti-immigrant offensive. 

A few days back, I wrote in one of these news letters, that most of the digital wallets in India are vulnerable. Now, reports are coming from different parts of India of people losing money just because of using these wallets. India's most popular digital payment app PayTM disappered from the App Store, due to bugs. It shows that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is paving the roads for  a 'digitised India' doesn't see the craters on the road.

Russia, Iran And Turkey Issue Joint Declaration On Syrian Settlement
 by Bill Van Auken 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/22/russia-iran-and-turkey-issue-joint-declaration-on-syrian-settlement/

After meeting in Moscow on Tuesday, top officials of the Russian, Iranian and Turkish governments issued a joint eight-point statement of principles calling for the extension of a ceasefire throughout Syria and a negotiated settlement between the Syrian government and its opponents. Much of the statement, dubbed by Russian officials as the ""Moscow Declaration,"" was boilerplate. It declared the three countries' support for ""the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic,"" while affirming that ""there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict.""

Will Proxy Politics Bring Death For Madaya Siblings Manal And Mohammed-Kamal?
by Franklin Lamb 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/22/will-proxy-politics-bring-death-for-madaya-siblings-manal-and-mohammed-kamal/

According to a new Iranian draft relating to the East Aleppo evacuations, which I was shown a copy of, it contains this key language: ""The evacuation of humanitarian cases from the (ed: mainly Shia) Villages of Foah and Kefraya, in Idlib Governarate are to be achieved simultaneously with the evacuation of wounded from (ed: two government-besieged Sunni towns 25 km Northwest of Damascus near Lebanese border)  Madaya and Zabadani.""   Dear reader will note that two different standards for civilian evacuations are included by Iran, i.e. ""humanitarian cases"" for the Shia villages of Foah and Kefraya and ""wounded"" from the Sunni villages of Madaya and Zabadani. If literally applied, these evacuation standards would mean that potentially many Shia would be evacuated but few Sunni.

With the bodies fresh in the morgue, former US ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton, peered into the mind of the everyday German, and found teeth chattering fear.

Growthism: Part 2
by Erik Lindberg 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/22/growthism-part-2/

 The universe may be infinite but our biosphere is not.   Innovation may be able to stretch our biosphere's carrying capacity, but it cannot breach its limits without dire consequences.  And as the cosmology that carried humanity to the brink of extinction (if, indeed, it does not), our present faith in the infinite universe, or in knowledge as power, as controlling metaphors for human behavior will someday be viewed with as much contempt and derision as we direct toward pre-modern, pre-Growthist thought today.  School children will stand agape, wondering how?—how people once believed that there were no thermodynamic or biological limits to how much they might have and do.

PUDR is concerned at this growing political climate in which the judicial verdicts have been echoing the executive actions in creating an official discourse of state-centred nationalism, even the slightest defiance of which invites both legal and social prosecution.

Russian Ambassador was shot dead yeserday in Ankara. With both Russia and Turkey condemning the terrorist act unanimously, and their plan to go ahead with the tripartite meeting involving Russia, Iran and Turkey on Syria, it seems that the terroist act will not have repercussions in the immediate future. But there will be forces which would be waiting in the wings to capitalise this tragic event to their advantage. 

The demonetisation tsunami is slowly gaining momentum. One mild wave touched me today. One friend, who needs to build an urgent store-house in his farm, was hit by cash shortage. With the withdrawal limit set at Rs 24, 000 a week he can't pay the workers, buy materials and get on with the urgent construction.  He asked me if I can lend him some urgent money. 

In the past two days I read two suicide reports in the news paper, directly caused by demonetisation. There must be many that go unreported. 

The ruling elites who devised this plan, purported to be a 'surgical attack' on black money, but which with each day becoming more and more clear that it's a world bank devised plan (with the support of Bill and Melinda Gates foundation) to shove digital economy down the throat of Indian people which will be beneficial only to Indian and other transnational oligarchs, and suck up wealth from the bottom to the top in a monumental way, with ordinary Indians becoming poorer and the rich getting richer. http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2014/08/28/world-bank-report-digital-payments-economic-growth

 Russia And Turkey Condemn The Assassination Of Russian Ambassador In Ankara
 by Bill Van Auken 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/20/russia-and-turkey-condemn-the-assassination-of-russian-ambassador-in-ankara/

The killing of the ambassador also came on the eve of a scheduled meeting in Moscow between Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu and his Russian and Iranian counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Mohammad Javad Zarif, to discuss the ongoing ceasefire in and evacuation of previously opposition-held eastern Aleppo, along with proposals for a more comprehensive settlement of the five-and-a-half-year-old Syrian war. Both the Russian and Turkish governments condemned the assassination of Karlov as a ""provocation"" aimed at disrupting relations between the two countries. Both governments likewise described the killing as a terrorist act, though they appeared to differ in their assessment as to who was responsible.

Demonetization: The Politics of Public Suffering
 by Dr Prem Singh 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/20/demonetization-the-politics-of-public-suffering/

 There have been various and repeated references to the suffering of the public caused by the decision of demonetization by the government. The suffering of the ordinary people due to this astounding decision has been criticized even by the High Court and Supreme Court.  Around 100 people have died because of it. The supporters of Prime Minster Narendra Modi claim that people are not distressed with this decision; they are happy; if people were unhappy, they'd be on the streets protesting instead of queuing up outside banks. But at the same time they are seen threatening the sufferers and the journalists who dare to high light their plight. However, at some point Modi supporters could recognize the suffering of all the people who are queuing up outside banks from morning till night.

On one hand, the technology of 'Digital India' (so called cashless society) is used to victimize the poor and middle class population in India due to the invalidation of high value currency notes. On 08th November 2016, the Prime Minister of India made an announcement of demonetizing higher value notes and the majority including poor welcomed and appreciated the move. The society always fails to realize the hidden agenda of the political game.

Since the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States, I've given daily thought to the more alarming aspects of Trump culture.  Conversations among friends have been quite helpful, both here in the U.S. and in far- away Kabul from which I recently returned.  It becomes hard to envision constructive responses to Trumpism without a steadfast focus on the larger culture which has made the policies of previous administrations seem acceptable and normal. This is part of why I was quite willing to sign the recently drafted ""We Stand for Peace and Justice"" statement at www.standforpeaceandjustice.org. This morning I read comments about the statement that have been posted, online.

Christmas Day is the court-ordered deadline to evacuate around 330 settlers from the Amona outpost. The colony is built on the farmland of Palestinian families who still live nearby, north of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Eighty-year-old Maryam Hamad, who lives in the neighboring Palestinian village of Silwad, owns six acres there, where she once cultivated wheat. She has not been able to visit her land for 20 years, since Amona was established in the mid-1990s. She expects to return to the land when the settlers leave.

Aseem Shrivastava another reputed economist argues that the agenda behind demonetisation was never 'black money' as it was being propagated.  He argues that demonetisation is actually a ""Weapon Of Mass Digitisation"". He points out ""according to research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group there is an annual jackpot of $500 billion (a quarter of India's GDP) waiting to be made within the next five years in the digital payments industry.

Demonetisation: Recessionary Conditions Take Hold
 by Dr Arun Kumar 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/19/demonetisation-recessionary-conditions-take-hold/

Demonetization is all about currency and the amount of money with the public. Since the public has no interface with the Reserve Bank of India, they have to deal with the banks for their daily requirements of money. Consequently, demonetization has had a dramatic impact on banks in India and this is likely to persist.

But this is only if millions can be persuaded to abandon cash as the preferred mode of daily transactions. Even if the top half of the Indian population can be drawn into the digital net, there are big fortunes to be made. The bottom half can be ignored, unless they become politically restless and vocal.

Clinton's Defeat And The 'Fake News' Conspiracy
 by Jonathan Cook 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/19/clintons-defeat-and-the-fake-news-conspiracy/

If Russia did indeed seek to influence the election by releasing truthful information that made Clinton and her allies look bad that would be far more legitimate interference than the US has engaged in against countless countries around the globe. For decades the US has been actively involved in using its military might to overthrow regimes in Latin America and the Middle East. It has also compromised the sovereignty of innumerable states, by sending killer-drones into their airspace, manipulating their media and funding colour revolutions.

Deck The Halls With Boughs Of Holly? Celebrating The Corporate Plunder Of Agriculture
 by Colin Todhunter 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/19/deck-the-halls-with-boughs-of-holly-celebrating-the-corporate-plunder-of-agriculture/

We need look no further than India to appreciate the important relationship between culture agriculture and natural world, not least the vital importance of the monsoon and seasonal planting and harvesting. Rural-based beliefs and rituals steeped in nature persist, even among urban Indians. These are bound to traditional knowledge systems where livelihoods, the seasons, food, cooking, nutrition, seed exchange, healthcare and the passing on of knowledge are all inter-related and form the foundations of culture and the essence cultural diversity within India itself. In this link, Vandana Shiva describes the role that mustard plays in all of this.

The Beard Question: Religious Duty or Discipline?

Demonetisation Debate: Clash Between Faith And Evidence
 by T H Sreerama 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/18/demonetisation-debate-clash-between-faith-and-evidence/

The silent suffering of the people is largely due to extreme faith in individual actions of the superhero. It is due to extreme belief that these are genuinely intended and would prove effective in tackling black money. The fact of demonetisation only creating inconvenience to the poor, but having little effect on black money may perhaps shake the large sections to become more conscious to the realities of irrational actions of an individual. The shaking of faith in super hero could prove to be a blessing in disguise. It could break the pattern of belief in supremacy of faith, religion, irrational actions of an individual and beliefs based on lack of evidence.

 Informing the public of high level corruption is a grievous sin in the Obama administration. So it was that a jaunty President Obama appeared for his final news conference — just before setting off for a Christmas vacation to Hawaii costing millions and paid for by the taxpayer. The Russians hacked the emails; the Russians influenced the election; this has to stop; we'll consider a measured response.

Microfinance Can Actually Harm The Poor

Although the poor obviously do not have enough money, the reason why they remain poor goes beyond the mere availability of cash, especially if it comes with a price tag of high interest rates. Poor people need to be economically empowered by addressing the underlying reasons for their exclusion from political and economic processes, not by providing them with just a small loan.

Trying Misogyny Welcome, But How About Curbing All Crimes Against Women?

It is fourth anniversary of 16 December 2012, the brutal gang rape and murder of a student in Delhi that shook the conscience of the nation and led to unprecedented protests against sexual violence across India. Crime against women has been common in India, as has been the support for such crime in the form of misogynist statements by those holding seats of power. The grammar of shame in cases of sexual violence has always been inscribed on the bodies of victims, avoiding most perpetrators. It is in this context that the Supreme Court of India taking on Azam Khan, a powerful minister of Uttar Pradesh government, and making him unconditionally apologize for a brazenly misogynist statement against gang rape victims, is a welcome step.",Demonetisation: Stories Of Flesh And Blood,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/18/demonetisation-stories-of-flesh-and-blood/,2016-12-18 11:47:58,13,1,10,13,0,0,0,0,0

The note ban or the so called demonetisation is going from bad to worse in India. Petty traders, small scale industries are going burst.

The poor are suffering the most. Countercurrents.org has been telling their stories with our #HumansOfDemonetiseIndia picture stories.

What would have happened if Joseph and Mary were to travel to Bethlehem from Jerusalem now? They would be prevented by the Israeli security guards at the serpentine apartheid wall! Professor Francis Boyle writes a moving piece "" O Little Town of Bethlehem"". 

Aleppo has fallen to government forces in Syria, much to the chagrin of USA. Secretary of  State John Kerry has lashed out at  Syria  and threatening that this is not the end of war. 

Not far away, USA is conducting a similar operation in Mosul against ISIS forces, according to most independent observers a monster of its own creation. The sad fact is that the western media is silent about the plight of the civlians caught up in the so called 'Mosul Offensive'. 

Not  far from Syria and Iraq, a massacre is going on Yemen. Here too the western media is silent about the massacre of civilians. Why?

The hypocrisy of the US denunciations of the brutal methods employed by the Syrian government and its allies in eastern Aleppo has been underscored by the unfolding of a similarly savage siege being directed by the Pentagon against the far larger urban population of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. As many as 1.5 million people still live in that metropolitan area, which the Iraqi army surrendered to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in June 2014.

This ongoing senseless carnage in Syria has taken my breath away and left me with a sense of sadness, utter dismay and shock. The wave of violence leaves one truly speechless, pushing everyday concerns and problems firmly into the background. At a standstill, I have a short message for the World Community: ""As the Syrians are living on the edge of their lives, always nervous, always afraid. Thousands have already died, thousands more will die. It is our privilege to work in the space domain, which does so much to promote a world without borders. We have a special responsibility in this regard. Don't waste time. Come forward and save the rest, please! It's high time to show humanity and provide international protection to Syrian people. Otherwise, it will be shameful for the entire world.

While the world is transfixed on the epic tragedy unfolding in Syria, another tragedy—a hidden one—has been consuming the children of Yemen. Battered by the twin evils of war and hunger, every ten minutes a child in Yemen is now dying from malnutrition, diarrhea and respiratory-tract infections. A new UNICEF report shows over 400,000 Yemeni children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Without immediate medical attention, these children will die. The situation is so dire that over half of the entire nation's 25 million people lack sufficient food.

It's a fiery and passionate defence of degrowth, and contains much, in its spirit and in its message, that I agree with. But it does raise some key points that I want to explore here and to challenge.

There is clear indication that US foreign policy will not change course under a Trump administration – it will simply change tactic.

The CIA conclusion had a broader context to it, suggesting a pattern of hacking and penetration that was far from specific to Clinton.  In other words, it was, again in the words of one of the three officials, a ""judgment based on the fact that Russian entities hacked both Democrats and Republicans and only the Democratic information was leaked.""  It was, to that end, ""a thin reed upon which to base an analytical judgment.""

US Gov't, Oligarchs Behind Planned Fake News Flagging on Facebook
 by Robert J Barsocchini 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/16/us-govt-oligarchs-behind-planned-fake-news-flagging-on-facebook/

Facebook is adding a new feature wherein a group that the Washington Post calls an 'independent third party fact checker' will decide whether stories are real or fake, and flag ones the group decides are fake. WaPo leaves out of its report that the 'independent fact checker', the Poynter International Fact-Checking Network, receives funding from a US government-funded group, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which award-winning, independent journalist Robert Parry and author William Blum document was created to perform tasks previously performed by the CIA.

The Fire This Time: The Urban Housing Crisis
by Joseph Grosso

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/16/the-fire-this-time-the-urban-housing-crisis/

A pair of headlines the past two weeks illustrated the gruesome underbelly of the urban housing crisis. Last Wednesday night in the Bronx two young homeless sisters, aged 2 and 1, were found dead after a malfunctioning radiator in the room they shared caused steam to spew into the room inflicting severe burns on the girls. The building, part of the cluster-site program whereby the city houses homeless people in privately home buildings, had 26 open violations of the housing-maintenance code and multiple dwelling laws according to records from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

Bangladesh: Rekindling The Spirit Of independence
by Farooque Chowdhury 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/16/bangladesh-rekindling-the-spirit-of-independence/

With a perspective different from 1971, rekindling the spirit of independence (RSI) requires assessment of class forces, alignments and alliances these have made/entered into, historical capacities and limitations these bear. The dominating capital, its internal and external relations, its role and limitations are also to be assessed. Democracy and role of imperialism are two other fundamental issues to be examined.

Empowered Muslim Women: Islam Is Her Strength
 by Moin Qazi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/16/empowered-muslim-women-islam-is-her-strength/

The portrayal of Muslim women that we glimpse in the media is grim and somber. The public perception of them is one of stubborn stereotypes: supposedly powerless and oppressed, behind walls and veils, demure, voiceless and silent figures, discriminated and bereft of even basic rights. This picture keeps reinforcing itself, largely because this is how the Western media caricatures women in Islam. Recurring images beamed into our homes and phones keep strengthening the belief that Muslim women are being denied access to education, social space, privacy and educational and development programmes for their socio-economic uplift. But it has also reduced Muslim women to a stereotyped singularity, plastering a handy cultural icon over much more complicated historical and political dynamics.",#HumansOfDeMonetisedIndia: I Am Starving,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/16/humansofdemonetisedindia-i-am-starving/,2016-12-16 13:16:21,22,0,22,14,0,0,0,6,2

""It happens only in India"" is a popular dialogue from  a block buster Bollywood movie. While corporates are sitting on a mountain of 'Non Performing Assets' a bank in Marathwada is on an overdrive to recover the  'Non Performing Assets' of cashless farmers badly hit by 'demonetisation', reports well respected journalist P. Saianath. The greatest irony is that the bank does little to recover Rs. 352 crores owed by two sugar factories, meanwhile threatens 20,000 farmers who owe it Rs. 180 crores with public humiliation. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/13/bank-gandhigiri-cashless-hara-kiri-in-marathwada/ 

As the Editor of Countercurrents.org what concerns me most are two issues which can literally wipe out humanity and most of other species from the face of this earth. Climate Change and Resource depletion, especially Peak Oil. What CC tries to do is meticulous report the latest developments in both these fields as well as seek meaningful counter solutions. It is important that we should not fall into despair but act in whatever way possible we can. A perceptive CC reader will find loads of meanigful solution oriented pathways for each of one of us. 

Kim Scipes, an Associate Professor of Sociology at Purdue University writes an solution oriented article ""Suggestion For Addressing Climate Change And Other Forms Of Environmental Destruction"". It needs closer reading and wider discussion.

Suggestion For Addressing Climate Change And Other Forms Of Environmental Destruction
by Kim Scipes 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/13/suggestion-for-addressing-climate-change-and-other-forms-of-environmental-destruction/

The heart of this proposal is a drastic reduction in production, with the accompanying drastic reduction in work required outside of the household.  These ideas would seem to be attainable in any case; if they might help prevent the extinction of the human race, etc., I think they would be overwhelmingly embraced by most Americans and, importantly, most human beings across the planet.  Obviously, much discussion needs to take place, and much tweaking of the proposal done, but I think this is something possible—and a realistic way forward.

Growthism
 by Erik Lindberg 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/13/growthism/

Growthism began as a new condition of reality, became a solution, a solution so successful that it became inexorably embedded in our systems, directing and controlling them, appearing as an inescapable natural law; and then, just when it looked like we may have reached the limits of growth, Growthism  became an earnest, though idolatrous belief.  But as part of its cunning, Growthism contains each successive stage in the present, so that it is at once a condition, a solution, the end pursued by our every system, and a belief about what is good and right and natural.

From Oil Age To Soil Age
 by John Thackara 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/13/from-oil-age-to-soil-age/

In 1971 a geologist called Earl Cook evaluated the amount of energy 'captured from the environment' in different economic systems. Cook discovered then that a modern city dweller needed about 230,000 kilocalories per day to keep body and soul together. This compared starkly to a hunter-gatherer, 10,000 years earlier, who needed about 5,000 kcal per day to get by. That gap, between simple and complex lives, has widened at an accelerating rate since Cook's pioneering work

The Indian demonetisation saga is a slow moving tsunami. It gathers momentum from rural India and is going to engulf the whole of India. Starvation and famine are the most likely outcome.  We've already seen farmers dumping tomato on the road. How are they supposed to live? 

The government too is aware of this emerging scenario. I guess, that's why the government removed the import duty on wheat. This classical shock doctrine playing out. Agri-corporations are going to make a windfall. They may even push,  hotly resisted BT seeds into India. Will it end famine? Starvation? Unlikely. The imported wheat is most probably end up in urban supermarket and be consumed by plastic card holding urban elite, while the rest of India is submerged in the tsunami of starvation.
 
Are the plastic card holding class safe?  Vijaya Kumar Marla writes from his own experience ""Cashless India: Inviting Disaster"". He writes how bank networks malfunctioned, making plastic cards practically useless. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/12/cashless-india-inviting-disaster/

Yesterday, I talked to a 'Techie' friend who is well versed in the functioning of the 'e-wallets' sprouting everywhere in India and promoted by the Prime Minister himself. He said most of these e-wallets do not practice the basic security principles needed to make these e-wallets secure. He said most of them are vulnerable to hacker attacks, that to pretty easily! So, much for the dream of 'cashless India'.

Though both India and Pakistan are not parties to Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and the Statute of the International Criminal Court they are still bound by the customary principles of IHL concerning treatment of the dead. They should realise that the respect and compliance to the conventional and customary IHL pertaining to the dead is not only a legal duty but also in their mutual interest. Such restraints help boost their image as a responsible state committed to ethics of war in all circumstances.

Along with a deeply divided country, the worst income inequality since at least the 1920s, and a crumbling infrastructure, Trump will inherit a 15-year-old, apparently never-ending worldwide war. While the named enemy may be a mere emotion (""terror"") or an incendiary strategy (""terrorism""), the victims couldn't be more real, and as in all modern wars, the majority of them are civilians. On how many countries is U.S. ordnance falling at the moment? Some put the total at six; others, seven. For the record, those seven would be Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and, oh yes, Yemen.

1943 Gov't Film Offers Sharp Contrast With Current US Elite Attitude Toward Russia

In contrast to the elite views illustrated in this film, why are we today witnessing what Russia expert Stephen Cohen, and many other analysts, refer to as a storm of dangerous anti-Russian propaganda?  It can't be that US elites regard Putin as worse than Stalin, as that would make no sense, and since such concerns do not appear to animate their decision-making in the first place, as evidenced by their own behavior (ie Iraq invasion) and support for numerous other countries with oligarchic regimes, like Saudi Arabia.

Google Trends shows a remarkable spike in the interest for the coupled terms ""climate"" and ""hoax"". Does that mean that people are becoming more skeptical about climate science? Or simply more interested in the subject? On this point, Google Trends tells us that there has been no special change in the level of interest in the general subjects of climate change and global warming. The interest is specific in the coupling of ""climate"" and ""hoax."" And, if we couple the terms ""climate"", ""hoax"" and ""Trump"" we see that there is a clear correlation.

81307324765_10154828925944766,"Dear Friend,

As I quoted Antonio Gramsci a few days agao ""the old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters"".  With each passing day newer and newer monsters are being born. Now a new monster is born to hunt climate change scientists. President-elect Donald Trump's Energy Department transition team has reportedly been asking for the names of civil servants that have worked on environmental policies under President Barack Obama, sparking fears of a coming ""climate purge"" by the incoming Trump administration. 

Sensing the danger Lauren Kurtz, Executive Director at Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, published an article in the well respected Realclimate.org ""Defending Climate Science: 10 Things That Every Scientist Should Consider"". 

The attack on Climate Scientists is particularly alarming, vicious and threatening the future of the species. 

Like the fake news website list, another unknown group has prepared a Professors Watchlist. The list describes itself ""The mission of Professor Watchlist is to expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom."" At least one of the writers of CC is on the list. New McCarthyism is here. How do we fight it?

Also more stories from around the world. 

If you don't mind, and if you think the content of this news letter is critical for the dignified living and survival of humanity and other species on earth, please forward it to your friends and spread the word.

Climate Change: India Can And Must Go It Alone
 by Anandi Sharan 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/11/india-can-and-must-go-it-alone/

what about India? We CAN just go it alone. It is a fact that a small patch of land in a desertified landscape that has been restored to be a relatively natural ecological system has a micro climate that is ten degree Celsius cooler than the surroundings. I think surely it is worth giving the people of the subcontinent this opportunity to escape the worst impacts. Is this Republic so weak that we cannot defeat capital and its professional apologists here? Surely they are not yet so irreversibly entrenched?

How Standing Rock Has Changed Us
 by Sarah van Gelder 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/11/how-standing-rock-has-changed-us/

Nonetheless, this is a time to celebrate. The water protectors won a huge victory with the Corps of Engineers decision—a victory that benefits not only the Sioux tribes, not only those along the Missouri River, but everyone. We all drink water and need a stable climate. As we navigate what may be the most dangerous time in human history, the lessons from Standing Rock can guide us. As we create a post-fossil fuel society, we can take the lessons of respect and nonviolence, of valuing life over money, of learning from the indigenous peoples as cornerstones. A revolution in values and culture is rippling out across the country and the world, and it started at Standing Rock.

Modi's War On Cash: The ""Ice Nine"" Solution
 by C R Sridhar 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/11/modis-war-on-cash-the-ice-nine-solution/

The term ""Ice Nine"" is from the novel ""Cat's Cradle"" written by Kurt Vonnegut in 1963. This substance was discovered by a character in the book, a Dr. Felix Hoenikker, which could freeze another molecule of water when it came into contact with it.  ""Ice Nine"" had the awesome capacity to freeze rivers, lakes and oceans. In a financial panic, a ""Ice Nine"" approach means taking draconian measures to prevent or  severely restrict withdrawal of physical cash from bank accounts, shutting down ATM's and ordering asset managers not to sell securities. In other words this means financial repression or lockdown.

Demonetisation In India – What's Not To Love?
 by Merlin Flower 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/11/demonetisation-in-india-whats-not-to-love/

As the queues outside the banks grew, so did the misfortunes of the people. More than seventy people, mostly older citizens, lost their lives in the hustle and bustle of serpentines queues[i]. Where were the rulers? The Prime Minister, who is a vagabond, was basking in Japan. To be fair, he didn't have to stand outside a bank to exchange money. He may have changed notes a long time ago, you know.

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/11/humansofdemonetisedindia-sabuthe-auto-rickshaw-driver/

My name is Sabu. I am an auto rickshaw driver from Perumbavoor, Kerala. Perumbavoor is the capital of migrant labourers in Kerala. A lot of migrant workers used to work near this town. After the note ban, a lot of them have lost jobs and left for home. Sunday is their holiday as well their shopping day. On a typical Sunday we used to make Rs 4000-5000. Now we hardly make Rs 1000. It was this Sunday bonanza that kept our business going. We could pay our rent and pay off other debts. On other days too we hardly make Rs 500-700. Many of my friends have stopped plying. I don't know how they are surviving. Since I don't have to pay rent I keep going, but I don't know how long.

Telling Local People's History: An Interview With Hartford Activist Steve Thornton
 by Andy Piascik

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/11/telling-local-peoples-history-an-interview-with-hartford-activist-steve-thornton/

Steve Thornton has been an activist in Hartford since moving there in the 1970's after graduating from the University of Connecticut. He worked for many years for the Hartford-based health care workers union, New England District 1199, and has been involved in many organizations and campaigns in the city over the last 40 years. He also has a keen interest in local people's history, and some years ago started a website, shoeleatherhistoryproject.com, to popularize that history.

81307324765_10154822536564766,"Dear Friend,

This is one of the most difficult and most heart-breaking news letters I've to write. Defending what I've been doing for the past 15 years believing that this would make this world a better place and give our future generations a dignified living. It seems all my efforts have come to a nought. Countercurrents.org has been blacklisted by an anonymous website and it has been trumpeted by a 'respectable' news paper like Washington Post. 

Antonio Gramsci wrote ""the old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters"". Yes, the new world has brought forward monsters like Narendra Modi, Donald Trump, Brexit, and now ""Fake News Blacklist"". 

Why is this?

Robert J Barsocchini gives a historical context,  ""Fake news propagated by the US government and collaborating organizations such as the New York Times and Washington Post helped create an environment in which the US was able to illegally invade Iraq in 2003, killing at least one million and possibly upwards of two million people, including the deaths of some 4,500 US soldiers, according to a meta-study by Nobel-winning Physicians for Social Responsibility.Just this November, nearly 6,000 people were killed in Iraq thanks to the conflicts that are still raging due to the invasion (which is ongoing), and it was not an atypical month – even more were killed in October.""

Like the Brexit, in Italy, Matteo Renzi lost the referendum and was forced to resign. The 'deep state' news (propaganda) peddled by the mainstream media is no longer accepted by the masses. What's the choice before them? Click-bait journalism! Ugor Bardi of University of Florence makes it very clear "" the  opposite of a lie is not necessarily the truth"".

The populace are thrown between the devil and the deep sea. Which way to go?

Romi Mahajan gives some perceptible tips to the concerned and discerning citizens

1.       Stop clicking on, forwarding and retweeting random, unprovenanced material.
2.       Make your views clear to the publishers of these sites- that you want real, fact-based journalism and not opinions and vituperations with no substantiation and connection to logic.
3.       Financially support real journalism.
4.       Subscribe to print publications that produce thoughtful, meticulously researched materials
5.       Demand more from every journalist and every publisher

 NYT, WaPo Fake News Still Bringing Real Guns To Iraq, Killing Thousands
by Robert J Barsocchini 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/09/nyt-wapo-fake-news-still-bringing-real-guns-to-iraq-killing-thousands/

Fake news propagated by the US government and collaborating organizations such as the New York Times and Washington Post helped create an environment in which the US was able to illegally invade Iraq in 2003, killing at least one million and possibly upwards of two million people, including the deaths of some 4,500 US soldiers, according to a meta-study by Nobel-winning Physicians for Social Responsibility.Just this November, nearly 6,000 people were killed in Iraq thanks to the conflicts that are still raging due to the invasion (which is ongoing), and it was not an atypical month – even more were killed in October.

Italy's Referendum: The Great Defeat Of Matteo Renzi, As Commented By Leon Tolstoy
 by Ugo Bardi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/09/italys-referendum-the-great-defeat-of-matteo-renzi-as-commented-by-leon-tolstoy/

There is a clear parallel between the results of the Italian constitutional referendum of Dec 4th, 2016 and those of the Brexit referendum and the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the US. In all cases, we saw devastating failures for the mainstream media. People refused to listen to the messages beamed to them. They had the feeling of being swindled and probably they knew that, when you start suspecting that you are being swindled, you probably are. And they reacted accordingly.

 by Mark Ames 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/09/the-anonymous-blacklist-promoted-by-the-washington-post-has-apparent-ties-to-ukrainian-fascism-and-cia-spying/

Last month, the Washington Post gave a glowing front-page boost to an anonymous online blacklist of hundreds of American websites, from marginal conspiracy sites to flagship libertarian and progressive publications. As Max Blumenthal reported for AlterNet, the anonymous website argued that all of them should be investigated by the federal government and potentially prosecuted under the Espionage Act as Russian spies, for wittingly or unwittingly spreading Russian propaganda.

Veterans Help #NoDAPL Resistance Achieve Significant Victory
 by Brian Trautman

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/09/veterans-help-nodapl-resistance-achieve-significant-victory/

Regardless of the future decisions and actions of the government and ETP and the nonviolent struggle against it, our children and grandchildren will be told of the historic unification of Native tribes and the efficacy of people power that made Sunday's victory possible. It is imperative that we put our trust not in the promises of government but in the actions of people who hold their government accountable to those promises. Nonviolent direct action has been proven to work in grassroots movements and campaigns against oppression. Whatever the outcome of DAPL construction, the beautiful and enduring spirit of bridging differences to work collectively to protect and secure human rights, as seen in the #NoDAPL resistance, is something that will inform and inspire peace and justice efforts worldwide for many years to come.

Localism In The Age Of Trump
 by Richard Heinberg 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/09/localism-in-the-age-of-trump/

2016 will be remembered as the year Donald Trump—a wealthy, narcissistic political novice with a strong authoritarian bent—was elected president of the United States after campaigning against economic globalization. The events are fresh enough in many people's minds that feelings are still raw and the implications are both unclear and, for many, terrifying. For those who have spent years, in some cases decades, denouncing globalization and seeking to build a localist alternative, this is surely a vexing and confusing moment.

The precipitating event here is this: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on December 7th that they want to continue the existing hostilities against Russia: specifically the economic sanctions that U.S. President Barack Obama initiated against Russia after Russia had accepted the overwhelming (90%+) request of the residents in Crimea to restore Crimea's pre-1954 status, of being for hundreds of years an integral part of Russia.

Even by these standards, Adani Mining has done well for itself.  The placation and encouragement of this famed abuser of the environment has been stunning.  Australian politicians at the state and commonwealth level have marched to its tune for some years now, seeing it as a blessed provider in the development stakes. Whatever ends up on the desk in Canberra on this subject, rest assured that this mining monster will receive an endorsement.

Home Truths About The Climate Emergency
by Share The World's Resources  

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/09/home-truths-about-the-climate-emergency/

As 2016 draws to a close, we appear to be living in a world that is increasingly defined by its illusions, where the truth is a matter of subjective interpretation or argumentative debate. Indeed, following the United States election and Brexit referendum there is much talk of a new era of post-truth politics, in which appeals to emotion count more than verifiable facts. But there are some facts that cannot be ignored for much longer, however hard we may try. And the greatest of all these facts is the escalating climate emergency that neither mainstream politicians, nor the public at large, are anywhere near to confronting on the urgent scale needed.

Against this backdrop- and in an increasingly corporatized world with rightward drift, Ralph Nader's new book comes as a solid and inspirational clarion call to ""break through power."" With a rich narrative sensibility, Nader explains clearly that if only 1% of people spend even 300 hours a year on clear, goal-oriented activism, the world can be shaped by the contours of fairness, justice, and equality. He tells us about scores of people- many of whom are unknown to many of us and unsung by the media- who bettered society on the basis of determination and morality.

The Allahabad High Court has finally got the clock of judicial activism ticking by saying that triple talaq  is unconstitutional. It was no surprise   and the liberal strands in Muslims thought had already stood out clear.  Indeed, one of the reasons triple talaq has remained legal so long is the fear, propounded by Muslim community leaders, that if the government is allowed to tamper with Islamic personal laws, it might one day scrap them completely, and the majority will swallow them up.

 It is becoming absolutely clear that India is going into a deflationary spiral after the demonetisation of high denomination notes on November 8. A Tsunami is building up from rural India which will devastate the whole of India. 

Angry farmers in Raigarh district in Chhattisgarh are dumping tomato on highways. The reason? They are getting 50 rupees for a 100 kg batch of tomato. That means they are getting 50 paise for a kilogram of tomato. Ironically, 50 paise is practically out of circulation in India. I've written a story explaining the implications and possible fall out of this deflation. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/08/tomato-at-50-paisekg-a-windfall-or-disaster/

Our #HumansOfDemonetisedIndia campaign continues with the story of a farmer from Odisha. He says people of the remote districts of Koraput and Kalahandi may not be even aware of the note ban. 

President elect Trump is putting together a team of military hawks as his cabinet team. Latest to join the team is retired Marine General John Kelly to head the Department of Homeland Security.

Also more stories from around the world.

Tomato At 50 paise/Kg! A Windfall or Disaster?

#HumansOfDemonetisedIndia: Nabakishore Pradhan, Farmer From Odisha

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/08/humansofdemonetisedindia-nabakishore-pradhan-farmer-from-odisha/

My name is Nabakishore Pradhan. I am a farmer from Odisha. My family is dependent on our agricultural produces and now is suffering due to demonetization. I cannot get loan from the banks to tend to our farming needs. My relatives do not have money to avail medical facilities. In every field of life, we are suffering. Life has come to a standstill. As a society too, we are suffering collectively. In Koraput and Kalahandi, there are people who still are not fully informed about the implications of demonetization. Hence, they have not found a way to exchange their currency notes which they have saved since long. They are now doing barter trade instead, to overcome the hurdles. Such dire situation is unfortunate…I do not think this problem is going to go away for at least another couple of years. The government's stress on e-payment is of little use for most people in our country who are not that aware of the nuances of online business and many people will be cheated by fraudulent activities in coming days. This decision is extremely dangerous for our society.

Prime Minister: India needs A Social And Not A Digital Revolution
 by A concerned Citizen 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/08/prime-minister-india-needs-a-social-and-not-a-digital-revolution/

Prime Minister, it is not the digital revolution that India requires but the Social revolution. It is not the cashless-ness but the end of social lawless-ness that is required urgently. In the India that you are trying to build, forget cashless-ness, but social lawless-ness has definitely increased. We are seeing increasing incidents of deaths and physical harassments taking place in the name of cow protection and beef. We are increasingly witnessing the vigilante groups moving freely and harassing people – whether Dalits, Minorities in the name of protection of a culture, which you define as Hindutva. Intolerance has only grown. In the digital pathway that you are laying, you are also sowing the seeds of social lawless-ness at a rapid pace.

Demonetisation And Gandhi
 by Nivedita Dwivedi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/08/demonetisation-and-gandhi/

The demonetisation move led to the disruption in the life of millions (most of them from the poorer sections of society), and hundreds lost their lives. But the interesting thing in all this is that this move is being hailed and projected as the most democratic move ever made, because it is being proclaimed to have been carried out in the name of the masses and for the whole and sole benefit of the masses. How further from the truth could one really get? Coming back to the question of democracy and violence, is this not the practice of the worst kind of violence possible?

'Mitron' Fact Is Stranger Than Fiction
 by Mirza Yawar Baig 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/08/mitron-fact-is-stranger-than-fiction/

I discovered a new word: Mitron. It means, 'A large group of unsuspecting people about to be hit by something they will take a long time to recover from.' Ironically it comes from the Hindi word – Mitron (Mitr = friend. Mitron = of friends). I believe we are in a Mitron moment; the discovery of a word and an experiential understanding of its true meaning.

Fatah, Hold Your Applause: Palestinian Body Politic Rotten To The Core 
 by Dr Ramzy Baroud 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/08/fatah-hold-your-applause-palestinian-body-politic-rotten-to-the-core/

In July 2003, the then Palestinian Authority Chairman, Yasser Arafat, described Mahmoud Abbas as a 'traitor' who ""betrayed the interests of the Palestinian People."" Arafat loathed Abbas to the very end. This particular outburst was made during a meeting with the United Nations envoy, Terje Larsen. The meeting took place a few months after Arafat was coerced, by the US, Israel and other Western powers to appoint Abbas as Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority.

All four women disagreed, insisting that any aid from outside Afghanistan goes to people who will never share it with the needy.

Exploiting Terrorism For Economic Gains
 by Nauman Sadiq

In order to understand the hype surrounding the phenomena of Islamic radicalism and terrorism, we need to understand the prevailing global economic order and its prognosis. What the pragmatic economists forecasted about the free market capitalism has turned out to be true; whether we like it or not. A kind of global economic entropy has set into motion. The money is flowing from the area of high monetary density to the area of low monetary density.

It's a scathing attack on demonetisation, its possible fall out and a thorough expose of Modi's character structure. It's one of the best to have come out so far after demonetisation. 

Your's truly have done a reportage of the exodus of migrant workers from Kerala after the demonetisation. 

Our #HumansOfDemonetisedIndia campaign continues with the story of  Ittiyavirah, a petty trader of spices. His small business has been devastated by demonetisation. He is distraught and tears flowed through his cheeks. It's an embarassing situation to see an old man cry.  In our conversation he mentioned suicide several times. So many people in India are going through similar situation. Can you help us to get their stories be heard? Please go out and talk to your grocery shop owner, a farmer, a pentioner, a worker.... ask them what they feel about this demonising demonetisation.

Demonetisation: The Sultan Of Sophistry
by Satya Sagar 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/07/demonetisation-the-sultan-of-sophistry/

A month after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his demonetisation policy, the gloomy weather in the national capital describes quite well the mood of the people here. Sullen but not angry, worried but not yet panicked, uneasy about the future but focused for the present on solving daily problems. And yet somewhere deep down there is a growing feeling that we are witnessing the twilight of the Indian Republic – at least as we have known it for over six decades- a sovereign, federal, democratic nation, which with all its flaws, stumbles along intact. Few fully understand the real implications of 86% of the Indian currency disappearing overnight but there is foreboding it is a sign of many more drastic events to come.

My name is Ittiyavirah. I am a petty trader of spices. When the note ban was announced all the money I had with me from that day's trading became useless. Bank is not giving me money. After standing long hours in queue they give 4000 rupees. Farmers who come to sell me one or two kilo grams of their produce need urgent money. How will I pay them? I turn them away. You ask me why I'm sitting here? What else can I do? I buy my groceries on credit from my neighborhood store. How long will he give me credit? I haven't paid my rent. I never broke a month's due. It's a question of dignity. I've lived through Indira Gandhi's emergency. It's worse than emergency. They could have put a bomb on our head and killed us all. Why should we all live through this suffering? What's the way forward for people like us? Suicide?

Prince Ea, rapper and spoken-word artist and social justice advocate, has a soliloquy on YouTube with a surprising title: WHY IM HAPPY TRUMP WON. How could he think that, as he has passionately called for recognizing the dignity in all people? He's happy, he says, because he sees this election result as a wake-up call. It forces us to recognize the sickness of our society and ""that we cannot legislate our way out of human problems, nor can we truly change the world by changing the rulers.""

The sudden thaw in Turkey's relations with Russia and latent hostility towards America is partly due to the fact that Erdogan holds the US-based preacher, Fethullah Gulen, responsible for the July coup plot and suspects that the latter had received tacit support from certain quarters in the US; but more importantly Turkey also feels betrayed by the duplicitous American policy in Syria and Iraq, and that's why it is now seeking closer cooperation with Russia in the region.

Her applications have so far been rejected. Aged 40, she has six children, the youngest of whom is still a baby.

We are living 'interesting times' (the Chinese way) in India. Is there a method in this madness? Padmaja Shaw who  retired as a professor of journalism from Osmania University analyses the events leading upto demonetisation and concludes that it resembles Naomi Clein's wonderful theory of ""Shock Doctrine"". Yes it is. ""Surgical Strike"", ""Shock and Awe"" these are words that can be seen profusely used to describe the recent demonetisation.  The result of this shock therapy is slowly emerging. All perceptible readers can see that the writing on the wall is not good,  perhaps ominous.

We all know that Climate Change is the most important issue of our times. Urgent action is a responsibility from our part towards our future generations. Are we able to communicate the urgency of the situation sufficiently to the genereal public? Ugor Bardi of University of Florence says, from his own recent experience, we have an information deficit and trust deficit. He puts it this way,  ""I think that more than an information deficit, there is a ""trust deficit"" that blocks communication. It is not enough to tell people how things stand: we need to generate trust. And trust begets trust. "" How do we generate trust in Climate Change communication? Let's put our heads together and think and act. 

There is a village in Bhutiachang TE of Udalguri district of Assam where villagers have found a way to co-exist and resolve the elephant-human conflict in an innovative way. Listen to their story.

Shock Doctrine At Work In India
by Padmaja Shaw 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/06/shock-doctrine-at-work-in-india/

 The series of events succeeded not just in creating shock, they invariably strengthened the coercive state, undermining the Constitutional limits to its power. This is the time to sharpen our abilities to see through the shock doctrine, if we are still to survive as a democracy.

#HumansOfDemonetisedIndia: Mallika, The Daily Wage Earner

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/06/humansofdemonetisedindia-mallika-the-daily-wage-earner/

My name is Mallika Lohar. I am a daily wage earner from Ruppur, Birbhum, West Bengal. Demonetisation has only been inconvenience for us. Our payments have been delayed, and now there are Rs. 2000 notes only. Wherever we go, there is no change for Rs. 2000. How can we go on without change? The grocery-store person is saying I should give him the note, and keep buying from him. But don't I need to buy other things?

Media Complicity Is Key To Blacklisting Websites
by Norman Solomon 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/06/media-complicity-is-key-to-blacklisting-websites/

We still don't have any sort of apology or retraction from the Washington Post for promoting ""The List"" — the highly dangerous blacklist that got a huge boost from the newspaper's fawning coverage on November 24. The project of smearing 200 websites with one broad brush wouldn't have gotten far without the avid complicity of high-profile media outlets, starting with the Post.

 
Troubled Waters: Trump, Taiwan And Beijing
 by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/06/troubled-waters-trump-taiwan-and-beijing/

There was much tittering in the US-China fraternity over the casual, yet infuriating engagement US President elect Donald Trump had with Taiwan's President, Tsai Ing-wen.  A reading of the reactions suggested meltdown, a terrifying, imminent apocalypse.  An outrageous booboo, or an typically uncharacteristic move hardly worth a mention?

 
The Profound Disappointment Of Angela Merkel
 by John Chuckman 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/06/the-profound-disappointment-of-angela-merkel/

Merkel has been de facto leader of Europe during an extremely challenging period, one demanding real statesmanship. Instead, she has provided attitudes and short-term fixes married to complete acceptance of the most destructive American policies possible. Her policies have alienated large numbers of her own people and, almost more importantly, contributed mightily to the weakening of loyalties in Europe – not a record of which to be proud.

Climate Science Communication: Trust Begets Trust

Without going into the details of the debate, let me tell you of an event that was an eye-opening experience for me. It made me understand that there is such a thing as an ""information deficit"" problem, but also that things are not as simple as that. I think that more than an information deficit, there is a ""trust deficit"" that blocks communication. It is not enough to tell people how things stand: we need to generate trust. And trust begets trust. But let me tell you the story.

Praja, Politics And People
by Ravi Nitesh 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/06/praja-politics-and-people/

When PRAJA (Peoples Resurgence and Justice Alliance) was announced by Irom Sharmila, it signalled somewhere a 'change'. This change was an effort to disturb the dirty stream of politics through entry of a fresh stream. As people's say, you will also become dirty if you will join politics, but it certainly doesn't mean that not joining politics will guarantee any self purification of already existed people, parties and ideas. In all such sense, PRAJA has definitely an upper hand to have this courage for entering as fresh stream.

 Today we've two important victories to report. In a long-awaited victory for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has denied a permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline.

It is indeed a historic victory for a people's struggle.  Rachel Olivia O'Connor & Richard Martin Oxman, and Kevin Zeese & Margaret Flowers write that we should not fall into complacency and develop a Plan B. Bigger battles are lying ahead of us. 

Statements from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners, the corporations behind the Dakota Access Pipeline point to this same conclusion. According to them as reported by CNN  they ""fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe."" As far as they're concerned, the White House's directive does not change past court decisions to green light the project. ""Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way,"" the company said in a statement.

Second good news comes from Austria where former chairman of the Austrian Greens, Alexander Van der Bellen,  won the presidential election against his rival from the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), Norbert Hofer.

Countercurrents is starting a new photo story series on the line ""Human of New York"". Our series is title #HumanOfDemonetisedIndia. The first story is that of Rakesh, migrant labourer from West Bengal. His story is quite tragic. I and some of my friends met him in a town called Perumbavoor in Kerala which is the hub of migrant labourers in Kerala. We could see that he had missed several meals. He had come to Kerala looking for work. Then demonetisation struck him down. No work. No money. No food. He just wants to go back home. He doesn't have money to buy tickets. When we gave him some money to buy tickets and food, he broke into tears. Who will sea his tears? http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/05/humansofdemonetisedindia-rakesh-the-migrant-labourer/

There are so many such stories of people affected Demonetisation in India. Will you join us in making their stories heard? Just take a photograph and write their worries in a few lines and send it to editor@countercurrents.org. Let's together make India heard.

Victory At Standing Rock: Dakota Access Pipeline Permit Denied
by Nika Knight 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/05/victory-at-standing-rock-dakota-access-pipeline-permit-denied/

In a long-awaited victory for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has denied a permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline, tribal leadership announced late Sunday. The agency will not allow the pipeline to be built under Lake Oahe, a reservoir near the tribal reservation, without a full environmental impact assessment that examines alternative routes for the pipeline.

Co-Written by Kevin Zeese and Margaret Flowers

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/05/nodapl-scores-major-victory-no-final-permit-for-pipeline/

Cannon Ball, North Dakota (Oceti Sakowin or Council of the Seven Fires Camp) – Today, the people won a major victory in the fight to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The US Army Corps of Engineers sided with the Water Protectors and refused the final permit that would have allowed Energy Transfer Partners to drill under Lake Oahe. There will be battles ahead but this was another amazing people-powered victory. When people unite, we have power. This time people power defeated big oil and big finance.

A Risky Fatalism: 'Temporary Hardships In Lieu Of A Better Tomorrow'
 by Rakesh S 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/05/a-risky-fatalism-temporary-hardships-in-lieu-of-a-better-tomorrow/

Demonetization and its continuing saga are reasons, strong enough to demonstrate our opinion and power. However we have failed on that front too. A nation's culture- belief system, attitude, plays a significant role in determining how they react to a situation like this. In India people look up to the state for guidance, leadership and direction. There might me many reasons for this complacency, however I feel that it has got a lot to do with our fatalistic attitude. 

The Aggression On Iraq By Bush, Blair And Howard
 by George Venturini 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/05/the-aggression-on-iraq-by-bush-blair-and-howard/

The Iraq Inquiry Report (2009-2016) documents how Tony Blair committed Great Britain to war early in 2002, lying to the United Nations, to Parliament, and to the British people, in order to follow George Bush, who had planned an aggression on Iraq well before September 2001. Australian Prime Minister John Howard conspired with both reckless adventurers, purported 'to advise' both buccaneers, sent troops to Iraq before the war started, then lied to Parliament and to the Australian people. He continues to do so. Should he and his cabal be charged with war crimes ?

Kashmir: Heaven In A Heartless World

Kashmir, a beautiful landscape, which has got admirers from all over the world is today crying for help. But its cries go unheard. Funeral after funeral. Troubled days and nights. Wounds burned and throbbed. Meaning to say, the valley is bleeding all the way. Instead of healing the wounds, people who claim it as 'the integral part' gave nothing but severe physical injuries and trauma to its habitants. Bullets, pellets and pava shells were used (and still) to kill, cripple and paralyse the innocents (mostly teenagers) raising voice against the State &  Central Government for their different freedoms. Thousands and thousands of the youth became the victim of security forces. More than 120 people lost their lives. More or less 200 lost full and partial eyesight. Some are recuperating from injuries and some are still battling for life.",Hard Won Victories and Long Battles Ahead,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/05/humansofdemonetisedindia-rakesh-the-migrant-labourer/,2016-12-05 08:48:47,1,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0

After one of the most divisive elections in  history, USA is vertically divided. The sad fact is that Countercurrents.org is caught in the vortex. A shady group called PropOrNot has blacklisted Countercurrents.org as  a fake news site along with Truth Dig, Truth Out and WikiLeaks and others. Here is the black list http://www.propornot.com/p/the-list.html.

The sad part is that a respectable news paper like Washington Post carried a story written by Craig Timberg, parroting the propaganda of this shady group without any verification. This is a direct attack on free speech and independent journalism.  Glenn Greenwald and Ben Norton of The Intercept termed it as the ""New McCarthyism"". Adrian Chen of The New Yorker, Matt Taibi of Rolling Stone and many others have condemned this attack on independent journalism.

Let me make it very clear that Countercurrents.org has no relation to Russian federation or do we have any connection not even to any Russian citizens, although we would happily welcome such interactions since that would bring more people to people interaction and usher in world peace.

I would like to make it explicitly clear that the mission of Countercurrents.org is to ensure dignity of life to every humans and other species on earth. We stand for world peace, justice and harmony. More of our mission statement can be read here http://www.countercurrents.org/about/

The action of PropOrNot is an insult to Countercurrents.org and as well as to decent journalism and human dignity. I wrote to PropOrNot. So far, no reply.  Sign this petition and tell Washington Post that smearing is not journalism.

 The great Indian 'Demonitisation drive' is driving India deeper and deeper into chaos, especially in rural India, where cash is the life line of the farmers. Without cash life has come to a standstill in  rural India. Many farmers are standing in unending queues at a time they should be at the farm planting the rabi crops. The government is unrelenting and pay no heed to the plight of the farmers. In this context Countercurrents has made a call to the government of India to show some empathy and  roll back the demonetisation of the old Rs 500 notes. Here is the statement,

""The currency shortage after demonetisation is so bad that there is real danger today of law and order breaking down very soon. As the Indian Supreme Court rightly warned,  there could be riots in the country. It will be an unmitigated disaster for the people of India  and there is real danger of collapse of institutions.
Before that happens the people of India should  come out and demand that the demonetisation of the old Rs 500 note be rolled back. ""

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/02/restore-the-old-500-rupee-notes-now-to-avoid-chaos/

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's friend Mukesh Ambani launched Jio Money, an e-payment gateway yesterday. The speech he gave at the launch gave away the connection between Mukesh Ambani, Jio Money and Demonetisation. Yours truly analysed a few important points of the speech. 

Hate has become so normal in our popular culture that people have no qualms in wearing the ""Nazi symbology"" and its offshoots on their sleeves. Are we losing our innate humanity asks Daag Ujjala. He writes, "" Is it the blunting of human emotions inherent in consumer culture? Is it the erupting glorification of narrow ethno-nationalism in which empathy across cultures, races, and creeds no longer exists? Let's openly discuss this on Countercurrents. Let's involve ourselves in asking the right questions, finding some answers, and fighting for a better world.""

Trumpism is a reality. Dr. Arshad M. Khan describes some of the growing hate crimes across America. Tom Price who is an opponent of Medicare and Medicaid, the government health insurance programs for the elderly, the handicapped and the poor that cover a combined total of 130 million people is going to be the  secretary of health!

What do we make of this? Daag Ujjala writes, ""each of us has 3 obligations- personal, financial, and political.""

Five Ways The Paris Agreement Can Address Oversupply Of Fossil Fuels
 by Michael Lazarus 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/02/five-ways-the-paris-agreement-can-address-oversupply-of-fossil-fuels/

The World Energy Outlook 2016, released last week, is just one among an increasing line of studies showing how nations need to slow and, ultimately, phase out investment in new fossil fuel supply infrastructure – from oil fields and pipelines to coal mines – if they are serious about keeping warming to 2C or less. At the same time, Norway is making licenses available for offshore drilling in the Arctic. New pipelines from the Canadian oil sands would enable the export greater amounts of highly polluting oil. The Australian government has approved large new coal mines to supply the Asian market. These types of investments only make economic sense in a future with 4–5C of warming.

Is it the blunting of human emotions inherent in consumer culture? Is it the erupting glorification of narrow ethno-nationalism in which empathy across cultures, races, and creeds no longer exists? Let's openly discuss this on Countercurrents. Let's involve ourselves in asking the right questions, finding some answers, and fighting for a better world.

Trumpism Is Here: Okay My Friends, Now What?
by Daag Ujjala 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/02/trumpism-is-here-okay-my-friends-now-what/

For many people- even for some of those who voted for him- the election victory of Donald Trump and the ensuing clustering of a motley crew of hawks, white supremacists, economic hitmen, and science-deniers came as a shocking knock on the reality door. The Presidential (system), stable since the country's founding, was pushed over and a bombastic businessman with no public service record assumed the position of ""boss."" Strange days indeed. Each of us has 3 obligations- personal, financial, and political.

Trump Names Medicare Opponent To Head Health Programs: Who Is Tom Price?
by Nick Barrickman

President-elect Donald Trump's selection of Georgia Congressman Tom Price as his secretary of health and human services makes clear his intention to carry out a fundamental attack on Medicare and Medicaid, the government health insurance programs for the elderly, the handicapped and the poor that cover a combined total of 130 million people.

While North America and most countries of the north exhibit a form of closet racism, Donald Trump's contribution has been to let it come out.  Bad idea.  It is an ugly genie that needs to be put back in its bottle and quickly.

Fidel Castro: Lessons in Nationalism for India
by Jayashubha 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/02/fidel-castro-lessons-in-nationalism-for-india/

The demise of Fidel Castro reminds us of this spirit of Nationalism particularly in the present times. In the contemporary time which are dominated by discourse on nationalism by the likes of Narendra Modi, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, where 'people' are reduced to a cog in the machine called the 'nation' and are further sub-reduced into much smaller parts like nuts and bolts in the name of 'religion', 'race', 'caste', 'ethnicity', where dominance of one over the other is justifiable. In this dominant discourse the rule of the 'few rich' over the 'larger poor', 'rich nations' over the 'poor nations' is but natural. Fidel Castro only broke those rules to define nationalism.",Show some empathy and bring back the 500 rupee notes,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/02/restore-the-old-500-rupee-notes-now-to-avoid-chaos/,2016-12-02 10:52:02,19,2,14,19,0,0,0,0,0

2. ""So far, credit in our country has mostly been high value and low volume Digital enablement has laid the groundwork for broad availability of low value, high volume credit. This will provide credit to our farmers, small shopkeepers, traders and daily wage earners. Again, the biggest benefit of this goes to the ordinary Indian.""

Point 1. Unproductive? Unproductive for whom? For the vast majority of Indians ,75 percent of rural India survives on Rs 33 per day , these currency notes were their life line. Now 86 % of it has been confiscated by combined effort of the banking cartel and the government of India. For them whatever little money they held on to was very productive. They could buy grocery, vegetable, pay hospital expenses, school fees, travel expenses and what not! Now that the money has been confiscated from them they have become 'unproductive'.

We need such champions of industry and leaders to make ""India Great Again"". Yes, our 'unproductive' money will become 'productive' for you.

Point 2. Credit. Ambani says, with demonetisation (confiscation) credit will become ""low value, high volume"". In layman's language high disbursal of loans at low interest rate. ""What a wonderful !dea Sirji"". But who will really get it? Do you know that banks won't lend without collateral? Do you know that India's daily wage earners do not have enough collateral to catch attention of a banker? Do you know that how difficult for farmers to get a loan? Do you know that most of India's farmers are neck deep in debt and committing suicide in their hordes? Then, who will get the confiscated money in ""low value, high volume""? You, Mr. Ambani and your friend Adani and other cohorts. We know that your total debt is nearly 2 lakh crores. We also know that you can no longer borrow from foreign markets since the dollar is so high.  Will you use our confiscated ""low value, high volume"" money to borrow more from us to service your debt? All the world knows that the global economy is contracting.

81307324765_10154789646649766,"Dear Friend,

It was pay day today in India, that is for the salaried class which makes up about 20 % of India's population. Still it was total mayhem today. Long queues, no cash in banks, long waits, road blocks.... many went home empty handed. Mind you, it was a big day for just the 20 % or less of India's population. The government came a cropper in the first pay day after demonetisation. Things are going to get worse in the coming days. 

How does the other half of India, NO, the vast majority of India's population live. They have no fixed salary. 70 % of them live on less than $ 2 a day. Without cash their lives have come to a stand still. Without cash their lives will not move.  India is moving towards a great calamity.  No media is reporting this emerging calamity. Mirza Yawar Baig says that what India faces is an  'empathy vacuum'. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/01/demonetisation-an-anesthetized-anarchy/

 In this mad ambitious ""Digital Revolution"" that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is leading these 70 % are left behind. Nobody is showing empathy to these people. Financial experts including former finance minister P. Chidambaram have said that it would take at least seven months to bring back the amount of withdrawn currency into circulation. If this government has a tinge of empathy left in them they should at least bring back the now withdrawn 500 rupee notes to increase cash circulation. If not..... I hate to make  a prediction. 

On a global scale Peak Oil is another calamity staring humanity in the eyes. Now, with record low crude oil prices Peak Oil has gone off the radar of the mainstream media. Bloomberg suddenly headlines ""A $900 billion Oil Treasure""  USA today headlines ""The Largest Oil Deposit Ever Found in the US"".  Ugo Bardi looks behind these sensational headlines. Also, don't miss Diego Mantilla's article ""Peak Oil By Any Other Name Is Still Peak Oil"" it will give you a historical perspective.

Demonetisation: An Anesthetized Anarchy
by Mirza Yawar Baig 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/01/demonetisation-an-anesthetized-anarchy/

The problem of geeky thinking is nicely mentioned in this article as the 'empathy vacuum'; the bane of life of those who are used to binary thinking and playing with imaginary numbers until they begin to believe in their own creations. What is starkly visible in our country today is a total absence of empathy for those whose lives have been wrecked by the demonetization drive.

Fidel Castro's Cuban Legacy: True Democracy Of  Good Health Care,  Low Infant Mortality, High Literacy & Ecosocialism
by Dr Gideon Polya 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/12/01/fidel-castros-cuban-legacy-true-democracy-of-good-health-care-low-infant-mortality-high-literacy-ecosocialism/

Vale Fidel Castro (1926-2016). Despite decades of illegal US sanctions, and an average per capita GDP of only circa $7,000 as compared to $56,000 for the US, Cuba has good primary health care, 100% literacy, a Western life expectancy, and an under-5 infant mortality of 6 deaths per 1,000 live births, the same as for the US. True democracy fundamentally means expression of the will of the people and in Castro's one-party Cuba that has meant  ecosocialism and the survival of infants for a decent, healthy, literate, educated and long life.

Bloomberg multiplies the number by the current oil price and comes up with a title that reads: ""A $900 billion Oil Treasure,"" for a piece that tells of ""bonanza"" and of ""the gift that keeps on giving"". USA today speaks of ""The Largest Oil Deposit Ever Found in the US"".

It published a very interesting chart, using data provided by Wood Mackenzie, the oil consulting firm, to show that fact. Unlike the ASPO chart, Bloomberg's chart only goes back to 1947, the year before Ghawar was discovered.

Open Letter To President-Elect, Donald Trump

The dust has settled on the Presidential election. Peoples and governments everywhere have accepted the reality that a controversial personality has been elected to the highest political office in the world.There is muted hope, indeed rejoicing, among those American citizens who have hitherto felt woefully disenfranchised, that their concerns will soon be addressed. Millions, however, are fearful their country will inevitably slide into an abyss, with stagnation and disenchantment at home and a poor image abroad. This is not what the Forefathers envisioned when they arrived on the Mayflower in 1620 and settled in Plymouth, Mass., seeking a more abundant life with religious freedom.

The ideological and political stagnation of the left should be viewed in this perspective. It is not the failure of the left politics as such. It is the failure of the leftist parties who have abandoned Marxism. The ideological weapon of Marxism at its crux is criticism. And there is no single communist party today upholding this. Marxism minus self-criticism becomes a dogma not a science and occasionally a doctrine like a state ""official ideology"" to persecute or silence criticisms

 Fidel Castro passed away. What a sad loss at one of the most turbulent times in human history. He was one of very few world leaders who understood the manifold crises humanity and our ecosystem face and rose up to challenge it. In his last days as an elder statesman he wrote extensively about climate change, nuclear war, world peace.... Most of his writings are archived in Countercurrents.org. With his passing we lost a prominent voice of reason. 

This is Countercurrents' tribute to Fidel Castro

Fidel, Comrade, Red Salute

Fidel, dear comrade, red salute. You embodied humanity's struggle for a free, dignified life, a life free from exploitation, a life full of love and with flowering of humane living. You are alive in our struggle. You are alive in humanity's struggle against all forms of exploitation, against all forms of bondage, all forms of indignity.

After Brexit And Trump: Don't Demonise; Localise!
Co-Written by Helena Norberg-Hodge and Rupert Read

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/26/after-brexit-and-trump-dont-demonise-localise/

Relocalising won't be easy. The forces that promote globalisation control most of the avenues of information to which people have access, and their propaganda saturates the media, including the Internet. It is going to take a linking of hands internationally – among labour and environmental groups, small businesses and family farmers, educators and students, religious groups and peace activists – to put new political leaders in place who do not ratify treaties that devastate our present and our future.

Prejudice, Ignorance And Granfalloons – Society In The Trump Era
 by Brian Davey 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/26/prejudice-ignorance-and-granfalloons-society-in-the-trump-era/

Energetic and ecological limits are mostly unknown because they are taboos. It would be great if people found out more about these limits because responding to them seems to me to the be the most pressing of all agendas for society. What is more likely however is that the bulk of the population will now pre-occupy themselves with granfalloons instead – and plenty of very educated people will help them.

If you wanted to get a sense of Australian foreign policy in the past, you would simply have to go to the US State Department's portfolios.  The rest was simple imitation, with the Australian foreign minister being no better than a mid-ranking State Department employee.  As with so much with previous assumptions, that book has been thrown out.  A Trump victory has given the first necessary jolt to the US-Australian relationship in years, and a needed one at that.

Each year on November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is commemorated. A commemoration in essence is an opportunity to reflect on the challenges, prove that progress can be made and celebrate victories. It is also a reminder of the obligations and the responsibility we all must own at both the private and the public level to ensure that every woman, every girl, in all corners of the world lives in a world free of violence and fear. They must be enabled to enjoy their most fundamental right to physical integrity and security.

Time To Acknowledge Indian Women Farmers
by Moin Qazi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/26/time-to-acknowledge-indian-women-farmers/

The Indian women farmer, almost never publicly acknowledged, reviled by superstition and patriarchy, and increasingly troubled by entrenched social and cultural mores and taboos bears the real burden of farm labour. Nearly 98 million Indian women have agricultural jobs, but around 63% of them, or 61.6 million women, are agricultural labourers, dependent on the farms of others, according to 2011 Census data. There has been a 24% increase in the number of female agricultural labourers, from 49.5 million in 2001 to 61.6 million in 2011.

The government of India is punishing the marginalised section of the society with its maniacal and diabolical changes in policies relating to the present demonetisation decision. From today onwards ordinary people can change their old notes only in Reserve Bank of India branches, situated in state capitals. People will have to travel long distances, stand in long queues to change Rs 2000. 

Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, in his November 8th speech said as item number 7 &8 

7. For your immediate needs, you can go to any bank, head post office or sub post office, show your identity proof like Aadhaar card, voter card, ration card, passport, PAN card or other approved proofs, and exchange your old five hundred or thousand rupee notes for new notes.

8. From 10th November till 24th November the limit for such exchange will be four thousand rupees. From 25th November till 30th December, the limit will be increased.

The government first limited the exchangable amount from four thousand rupees to two thousand rupees and now stopped it altogether. 

People have already lost faith in their own currency. Now, by going back on the word, given by the Prime Minister himself, will the Indian people lose faith in their own government?

Is Going Cashless A Possibility?
by Sudhirendar Sharma 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/25/is-going-cashless-a-possibility/

There is no denying the fact that massive quantities of unaccounted large-denomination currency is a huge public policy problem, but what purpose does replacing high-denomination notes with fresh notes of similar or higher denomination may serve is beyond easy comprehension? With each passing day, it is becoming clear that the government had indeed hurried through its decision, counting the proverbial chickens before hatching. Having opened the Pandora's box of divisive politics, the government should avoid going on an overdrive to make its erroneous decision look optimal ex post. Losing peoples' faith and investor's confidence will prove costly in the long run. It is a risk that is not worth taking!

Beggars Among The Rich Is A Clue To The Working Class Vote For Trump
 by Dr Arshad M Khan

Whatever Trump does, it is not going to be easy to bring jobs back.  Not only have these been shipped abroad but technology has changed.  Robots on the shop floor are replacing humans, and robots don't need breaks or sick leave or vacation time. As for the panhandlers, heaven help them.  The 'more tax cuts' mantra means less for them. A common measure of civilization is how well a society looks after its weakest and most vulnerable.  The new crop of leaders shows little promise in that regard.

The Reality Of Fake News

Fake news as reality; the inability to navigate the waters in which it swims; a weakness in succumbing to material best treated with a huge pinch of salt. That, we are told, is the new condition of the global information environment. Laura Sydell of National Public Radio's All Things Considered furnished readers with one such example: ""FBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide.""  Shared over half a million times, it ran on a site ""that had had the look and feel of a local newspaper"" (not that you can feel the website Denverguardian.com).

From the day one it was obvious that government of India's demonetisation move was a plunder of people's hard earned money. Countercurrents.org said so on the very first day itself.   On November 8th night when I came to know about the move I skimmed through my Facebook timeline. I was aghast. Even prominent liberals were applauding this anti-people move. When I visited the news sites, even the progressive ones were praising this bold master stroke by Modi. When I received the morning papers I  received a rude shock. Not a word against this monumental blunder. Some papers even carried articles by experts that it will flush out black money, even though it would cause 'minor inconveniences' for the people.  Some one had to call the bluff.  I wrote the article ""Economic Emergency In India And What Does That Mean For The Common People"" in despair, desperation and anger. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/09/economic-emergency-in-india-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-common-people/. Today,  former Prime Minister, Finance Minister and also a former governor of Reserve Bank of India, Mr. Manmohan Singh has called demonetisation ""organised loot and legalised plunder."" It seems that political parties are waking up to people's suffering. Opposition parties have called for a day of protest on November 28. Perhaps that day will determine the fate of demonetisation. 

Meanwhile another monumental protest is taking place in Standing Rock against dirty fuel, protect water and sacred lands. Solidarity is pouring in from around the world. Standing Rock is symbolic fight to protect what's left for the common people and the future generations.

Modi's Demonetisation Is A Well Thought-Out Move
by Vijaya Kumar Marla 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/24/modis-demonetisation-is-a-well-thought-out-move/

Many analysts and economic experts have aired their views about the recent Demonetisation move of the Modi Government. True, there are people who believe that it is undertaken with good intentions, but badly executed. The fact is that this move has been on the drawing boards of the Modi Government for more than one year. This, I believe is not a knee jerk reaction of the BJP government to the exposures of corruption cases which came in to the limelight recently. Nor is the move undertaken with utter lack of knowledge of economics as claimed by some commentators. My impression is that it is a move that is well thought-out and is executed with cold-blooded intentions.

Demonetisation And Terrorism
by Jayashubha

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/24/demonetisation-and-terrorism/

Though it has not defined terrorism, it can be assumed that it refers to Kashmiri militancy, Maoist insurgency in tribal belts and ethnic unrest in North-east apart from rise of Islamic radical groups.  Establishing a relationship between Demonetisation and Terrorism is too simplistic an argument by the Government. It tends to deny the root causes for emergence of militant activities and unrest among certain sections.

As I told the COP22 audiences, the battle at Standing Rock symbolizes the greater battle we all face: The assurance of cultural well-being and sustainability as a global community while combating the short-term visions and greed of corporations. We must remember the importance of hózhǫ́—balance—and that we, as beings of the Five Fingered Clan, are connected as k'é—relatives. We are made of the same four elements, and we share the same finite resources. As my my mother says: ""We may be coming from all four directions, but we all come from the same neighborhood—the earth.""

Eleven days ago, when Matt Musselwhite pulled into an encampment at Cannon Ball, North Dakota, in a 5-ton flatbed truck, he had no idea how he would unload the three tiny houses he had just hauled 1,500 miles from southwestern Oregon. Almost immediately volunteers emerged from the throngs of mostly Native Americans. Within hours, teams of 10 people were starting to assemble the first of the 144-square-foot wood structures while circulating free food and coffee.

Fear and trepidation are slowly building up, as US President-elect, Donald Trump, is fortifying his transitional team with people capable of bringing about a nightmare scenario, not only for Americans but for the rest of the world, as well. For Palestinians, however, the signs are even more ominous. From former New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani, to Republican leader Newt Gingrich, the Trump team is filling up with dishonorable men who have made careers out of pandering to Israeli interests and unabashedly discounting Palestinian rights.

Most people end up believing that there are only ever two choices on anything that matters and neither is particularly desirable. Unconsciously, they feel trapped and it makes no sense when they are told that they have many options from which to choose. This is not their experience and it just feels untrue. They will endlessly choose the lesser evil of two bad options on virtually everything that matters in their life and accept the trinket 'goods' they are allowed to choose, such as the nature of their hairstyle.

No let up in the demonetisation crisis in India. It has started to affect big businesses too. There is a good news to report today. Finally, good sense dawned on the government and allowed farmers to buy seeds for the new farming season with the old notes. That's indeed a big relief. 

Asantosh Kumar gives a fictionised, yet truthful account of what's really happening in many banks across India. A good read indeed. 

As the rupee crisis unfolds, skirmishes are happening on the border between India and Pakistan. Today, three Indian soldiers were killed one of the bodies mutilated. There were reports of casualties on the Pakistan side in the past few days. Hope you know what rulers do, in times of political crisis to divert attention? Time for concern. 

Law enforcement unleashed percussion grenades, rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures on peaceful water protectors battling the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota late Sunday. Now with Trump to assume power, the plight of DAPL protesters look grimmer. Time for global solidarity. 

Trump presidency is a reality. No point in calling some section of society ""deplorables"". One and only Chris Hedges comes out with a great column which is must read for everybody. He headlines the article ""We Are All Deplorables"" and concludes the article saying, ""our enemy is not the white working poor any more than it is African-Americans, undocumented workers, Muslims, Latinos or members of the GBLT community. The oligarchs and corporations, many of them proponents of political correctness, are our enemy. If we shed our self-righteousness and hubris, if we speak to the pain and suffering of the working poor, we will unmask the toxins of bigotry and racism. We will turn the rage of an abandoned working class, no matter what its members' color, race or religious creed, against those who deserve it."" http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/22/we-are-all-deplorables/

Fight Back or Go Under

But what's the alternative? Increasingly degraded lives. If we start fighting now, we'll discover a glory in that battle, even in our losses because they teach us and make us stronger. Rebelling is invigorating. It's an authentic life, not the superficial pleasantries of a lackey life.

The UN Climate Change Conference in Morocco that ended Nov. 18 was shaken by the election but remained determined to move forward. Trump won't find it easy to attain his goal. Many big U.S. corporations have awakened to the danger of climate change and are challenging his intentions.

Disrespecting the American Imperial Presidency
by Matt Peppe 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/22/disrespecting-the-american-imperial-presidency/

American presidents long ago became the equivalent of elected monarchs, beyond the democratic control of the those they purportedly serve. The occupant of the office is able to substitute his own judgments and whims for a universally applicable set of laws and limits on the exercise of power. It is what Dolores Vek describes as ""actually existing fascism."" Both parties have contributed to it, the media has normalized it, and the public has accepted its creation and continued existence without rebelling against it. It's time to stop treating the presidency itself with respect and start actively delegitimizing it.

Bodies As Propaganda: The US-Australia Refugee Agreement
by Dr Binoy Kampmark

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/22/bodies-as-propaganda-the-us-australia-refugee-agreement/

Canberra stands responsible for paying the very smugglers it supposedly abhors, breaching the core refugee law provisions of non-penalisation, non-discrimination and non-refoulement. But the US-Australia arrangement is another facet of a ghastly, even archaic policy that seeks to prevent and deny the nature of the world's global movements.

Attacks On Minorities In Bangladesh: Not  Communal But Fascistic By Nature
 by Taj Hashmi  

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/22/attacks-on-minorities-in-bangladesh-not-communal-but-fascistic-by-nature/

Recently, Muslim mob attacks on Hindu houses and temples in Nasirnagar (Brahmanbaria) and elsewhere in Goplaganj, Chittagong, and Sunamganj districts in Bangladesh have drawn wide media attention, within and outside the country. I can't agree more with Daily Star's editorial (Nov 2) that Government inaction would only embolden the bigots; and that: ""any mix of politics and faith cannot work a democracy…. Whoever plays with fire should know that fire would ultimately play him.""

Dear Friend,

The demonetisation drive in India is literally killing people. According to Huffington post 25 people have died. This doesn't count the 7 State Bank of India officials and driver killed in an accident in Kanpur and also two people from Kerala. There may be many more unreported deaths. Why these deaths? What crimes did they do to deserve these untimely death? They are just ordinary people trying to withdraw their own hard earn money from the banks. I'm speechless, dejected and terribly anxious. I fear what more to follow? Where will all this end?

In our video series ""Demonetisation: India Speaks"" a food teller tells how despite working each day from morning till the night, she has been unable to make 50 rupees a day (less than a dollar)!

It's all happening at a time when we all should be fighting collectively against climate change on a war footing. Stefan Rahmstorf , one of the top climate scientists of the world, writes  global temperature goes from heat record to heat record, yet the sun is at its dimmest for half a century. It's a period of solar minimum, still we continue to hit record year on year temperature. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/15/record-heat-despite-a-cold-sun/

And it's affecting our ecosystems very badly. According to a studey published in the journal 'Science' 2 percent of ""core ecological processes"" on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that had not been expected ""for decades."" Remember, it's just for 1°C temperature rise!

It's at this critical juncture that a climate change denialist like Donald Trump takes charge as the ""Pilot-In-Chief In The Post-Ecological Age"".  Kurt Cobb writes ""my metaphor assumes that every American believes he or she is on the same plane."" No, everyone on this planet is on that plane! Will he  crash the airliner of state (including climate and environmental policies) into a mountain or the ground?

At this juncture of momentous failure,  David Bollier's word's of wisdon assumes great significance. He writes ""I think we stand on the threshold of a much larger discussion about new socio-economic frameworks for meeting needs and new political systems for governing ourselves.  I see great promise in commons providing new modes of democratic governance and self-organization – at scales allowing for genuine participation, authority and responsibility. ""

Demonetisation And The Loss Of Faith In Rupee
by Mirza Yawar Baig 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/15/demonetisation-and-the-loss-of-faith-in-rupee/

Whatever the effects of demonetization may prove to be on black money, what is clear is that faith in paper currency has taken a very big hit. I am not sure if this loss of faith can ever be restored. The thought that is uppermost in the minds of people is that if the government can do this once, it can do it again. And if one government can do it, then so can another government. Try to think of what conclusion the average man and woman standing in long queues to exchange old notes for new; who may even lose a part of his savings in this process, will come to.

Dirty Fossil Fuel 'Business-As-Usual' Tactics Spew Out Of The International Maritime Organization At COP22

Since the UN climate meeting in 1997 in Kyoto, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) eagerly took on the responsibility to reduce shipping's GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement further kept the IMO in control of maritime GHG emissions, rather than incorporating them into state obligations. Now, we see a continual let down by the IMO going into the UNFCCC COP22 discussions in Marrakech, Morocco.

Trump: America's Pilot-In-Chief In The Post-Ecological Age
 by Kurt Cobb 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/15/trump-americas-pilot-in-chief-in-the-post-ecological-age/

Many Americans are frightened by the idea of Donald Trump as the country's new pilot-in-chief, fearing he'll crash the airliner of state (including climate and environmental policies) into a mountain or the ground. But my metaphor assumes that every American believes he or she is on the same plane. And, that understanding is what seems to have clouded the minds of so many when thinking about the U.S. presidential campaign this year. For those living in America's small towns and rural areas and for those in the downwardly mobile working class, their plane has already crashed!

I think we stand on the threshold of a much larger discussion about new socio-economic frameworks for meeting needs and new political systems for governing ourselves.  I see great promise in commons providing new modes of democratic governance and self-organization – at scales allowing for genuine participation, authority and responsibility.  Orchestrating a state/commons rapprochement may be the hard part, at least initially, but this is a fruitful line of innovation, especially at the city level.

Fantasies Of Impeachment And Protest: Continued Misreadings Of Donald Trump
 by Dr Binoy Kampmark

Trump has provided a vigorous, aggressive shake to the establishment.  The tremors are still being felt in the frail body politic.  For those who opposed, and ignored Trumpism altogether, forms of denial have taken even deeper root.  They have little interest in bringing the Trump voters into the fold, let alone idly waiting for a transition period to unfold.  Their tactic has now become one of uncivil disobedience ahead of the inauguration, effectively a challenge about the very idea of legitimacy in the United States.

She was the first woman to hold the job of US Attorney General, and on getting that position, held it for the duration of the Clinton administration, the longest tenure than any in the previous 150 years. Unfortunately for her, Janet Reno will be remembered for much that was wrong with that same administration.

81307324765_10154725798679766,"Countercurrents.org News Letter 10 Nov - Taking Stock of the Double Whammy

Dear Friend,

Yesterday, we were hit by a double whammy. Trump in America and an undeclared economic emergency in India. Today we should take stock of the situation. 

After a day of  closure, banks were opened today. Long queues were seen in front of the banks. There was melee every where. Bank employees are helpless. There are reports of people committing suicides and of a poor washer woman who saved two Rs 1000 notes died of shock after hearing, they are no longer valid. In the meanwhile, the crony capitlists are laughing all the way to the bank. 

Yes, Trump presidency is a reality. What should we make out of it? For America, for the world, for our planet. Trump is a climate change denialist. It's a indeed  a disaster for the world. But, was Obama or Clinton was any better? Wasn't the Paris agreement a sell off? An effort to monetise our forests, our seas, the biosphere and absolve the historical polluters of all resoponsibility of climate justice? Isn't it similar to the  ""Indulgence"" the Church practiced through the Middle Ages? Now the veneer is off. Now we have a climate denialist as the Commander-in-Chief. The onus is on us, The People, to take charge of the situation. What 'WE' do now from here on will decide the fate of our children and grand children. The gloves are off. It's time for some action. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/10/trump-the-president-what-does-that-mean-for-the-world/

Trump The President: What Does That Mean For The World?

President Elect Donald Trump: A Seismic Shock With The Magnitude Of A Political, Economic, Moral 9/11
 by Irwin Jerome 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/10/president-elect-donald-trump-a-seismic-shock-with-the-magnitude-of-a-political-economic-moral-911/

During the 2016 election campaign itself, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton virtually remained tone-deaf to so many core issues facing America. Instead, they constantly haggled between themselves over other much lesser matters while their more-principled counterparts sought, as best they could against hopeless odds, with the aid of many tireless journalists and independent or alternative news organizations, to focus the voters attention on so many critical issues like #DAPL that collectively speak to what amounts to the American Dream's Achilles Heel.

by Rachel Olivia O'Connor

 With regard to climate issues, racism and all else that concerns decent, aware citizens, I'd say that people are much more likely now to get into gear with hyper-activism, stirring up the creative juices of one and all dramatically to deal with the threats that Donald represents; activism, in general, would have gone to sleep with Clinton, as it did with Obama. The usual would have ensued. Not now. Just look at what's being posted on alternative media outlets if you want to confirm that the Call of the Wild Activists is being screamed out loud and clear like never before.

Demonetisation – A Rat Being Imagined As A Dinosaur
 by P Victor Vijay Kumar 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/10/demonetisation-a-rat-being-imagined-as-a-dinosaur/

To sum up, "" demonetization "" would have positive effect especially in arresting fake currency and little on black money excluding big shots and organized black money launderers. The problem is demonic and the promise by Modi is gigantic, and, however, the measure proposed is conciliatory. While the task is mammoth, the step towards it is feeble. While the benefit is a dwarf, the imagination is like a dinosaur. This is just a political pacifying measure to wash off the tears of voter who got disappointed for voting to Modi expecting Rs. 15 lakh into his account and reinstating the confidence of BJP cadre in the midst of all disappointing news everywhere including dealings with Pakistan.

by Dr Ramzy Baroud

The Fatah movement is involved in a massive tug-of-war that will ultimately define its future. Though the conflict is between current Palestinian Authority President, Mahmoud Abbas, and once Gaza strongman, Mohammed Dahlan, is in no way motivated by ending the Israeli Occupation, their war will likely determine the future political landscape of Palestine.

Think about it, every Tuesday morning in the White House this breakfast club decides who they are going to blow to smithereens that week, with fresh fruit and cappuccinos all around.

Seeds Of Farmer's Distress     
 by Moin Qazi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/10/seeds-of-farmers-distress/

Despite being the country with the second largest agricultural land in the world, hardly two fifth or forty percent of the agricultural land is irrigated. Also, even though the country boasts of being the highest producer of many major agro commodities in the world, it suffers from low productivity. The naked and cruel truth is  that agriculture remains its Achilles' heel, the source of livelihood for hundreds of millions of people but a fraction of the nation's total economy and a symbol of its abiding difficulties.

 Congratulations America: Have You Just Been Trumped?
by Colin Todhunter 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/09/congratulations-america-have-you-just-been-trumped/

If you have not yet watched the documentary 'You've been Trumped' (2012) by Anthony Baxter, you should try to. It's a film about how money and power, with the collusion of politicians, the media and the instruments of state, have complete contempt for and ride roughshod over ordinary people. It's a lesson in how capitalist 'democracy' functions.

The results of the US elections were not so surprising for me: after all, I live in a country where politics has been dominated by a financial tycoon, Silvio Berlusconi, for more than 20 years. Berlusconi and Trump share many characteristics, but the most curious one is that they are rich and that the poor vote for them. Why is that? Are the poor stupid or what?

Trump Threatens Us With Climate Disaster

Donald Trump's worst characteristic is his denial of anthropogenic climate change. The participants in the current UN climate talks in Marrakech are extremely worried about the effect that his election will have on the viability of the Paris climate agreement. In his campaign speeches, Trump has stated in his campaign speeches that, if elected, he would pull the United States out of the Paris agreement.

The real danger, of course, in whatever account is to be given of this conflict as it continues to escalate or devolve, is that if a peaceful resolution doesn't come soon from either President Obama's administration or that of America's new President-Elect, it could, itself, end up turning into yet another Wounded Knee-type 1973 Siege scenario with a lot of people getting hurt in the process. Democracy Now's recent video of a DAPL employee menacingly waving an AK-47 at Sioux Water Protectors before, thankfully, he was peacefully disarmed, is one such early red flag warning

Bhopal Encounter Killings And Rule Of Law

Dear Friend,

India is fast falling into the rabbit hole of fascism. All those who don't conform with the fascist Hindutva ideology are branded as anti-nationals. Eminent film maker and activist K.P. Sasi calls India, ""A Country filled With Anti Nationals"". Minorities, Dalits, Students, NGOs, activists... the list is long. The new entrant is a prominent TV channel NDTV. They are banned for a day, November 9. If this isn't the emergence of fascism, what else? It's time all sensible  people stood up and take action for the 'idea of India', failing which the whole of South Asia will blow up in a nuclear Armageddon.

 A Country filled With Anti Nationals!
 by K P Sasi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/06/a-country-filled-with-anti-nationals/

Just recently, the government  included even a prominent news channel in their list of anti nationals. The list of anti nationals today include even the mainstream media also. Even NDTV is being targeted today. Personally speaking, I think it is a good move. Now, even the mainstream journalists who are so used to publishing only official versions of news as their daily diet, will be forced to rethink from now onwards. And if they do not rethink, sooner or later many other channels and newspapers will also be targeted as anti-nationals in the near future. And if that happens, it would be nice fun. A nation filled with anti-nationals! Just think of it. Enjoy the fun!

Hillary Clinton – Mrs Strangelove?
Co-Written by Leif Elinder, Anders Romelsjö and Martin Gelin, three Swedish MDs

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/06/hillary-clinton-mrs-strangelove/

Hillary Clinton's fears concerning her rival candidate appear to be justified. At present she seems to be the most likely future president, and there is good reason for asking the question – Is Mrs. Clinton throwing stones in a glass house when she viciously attacks Donald Trump? Her efforts as Secretary of State are among the most warmongering in America's modern history. Should she become president, it seems highly unlikely that we would ever see the dawn of world peace.

Today is 6th November, the day we commemorate in  memory of  victims of Jammu massacre  1947 , many of whom even didn't know their fault to go to grave. A people which had faithfully obeyed & served the whole clan of Hindu Dogra rulers for almost a century, fell to the evil plans & contrived machinations of the same very rulers. But before the veil is pierced to look at these tyrannical faces , it is appropriate and in order to recall an instance of a nearby State, Chamba (Now in Himachal Pradesh) to dispel the notion that all Hindu rules were cruel or tyrants.

Eminent climate scientists John Crusius, Richard Gammon, and Steve Emerson writes that even afforestation is not going to solve global warming. They write ""In order for carbon storage even in tropical forests to be beneficial, it must remain stored essentially permanently (for many hundreds to thousands of years). No one can guarantee that future climate change, disease, and/or land use change won't cause release of this forest carbon back into the atmosphere, which would bring us back to the starting point, before any forest carbon storage efforts were even attempted."" They say the only solution is complete de-coupling from fossil fuels.

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/05/and-then-they-came-for-ndtv/

The ban on NDTV India is one more effort by the Government in crushing independent reporting. At a time when there is serious attempt being made to make the media either to toe the government line or face harassment, the attempt is only to make the media toe the line of the government. It is a definite attempt at placing restrictions on democratic rights and freedom of the press. More than the media, it is a direct attack on rights of the citizens

In order for carbon storage even in tropical forests to be beneficial, it must remain stored essentially permanently (for many hundreds to thousands of years). No one can guarantee that future climate change, disease, and/or land use change won't cause release of this forest carbon back into the atmosphere, which would bring us back to the starting point, before any forest carbon storage efforts were even attempted.

In response to UNESCO resolutions adopted in October that were highly critical of Israel's protection of sacred and cultural Islamic heritage sites in Jerusalem, there is again a fiery confrontation between Israel and this UN organ whose actions have so often touched the raw nerves of Western political sensibilities. The main UNESCO resolution 'deeply deplores' Israel's failure to stop a series of excavations and related activities in East Jerusalem, which are declared to be harming Islamic sites in Jerusalem, and above all complains about Israel's interference with worship and serenity at the Al Aqsa mosque

Nevertheless, a steady stream of disputes has arisen between local populations, the government, and an increasing number of hydro plants that are meant to create electrical currents out of water currents.

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/05/who-killed-swamy-laxmananda/

The contents of the book are extremely disturbing to anyone concerned with the health of democracy and the rule of law anywhere in the world. How officials, the judicial system, the politicians and even the common people conspire to violate and enjoy impunity, and what is worse, make the innocent a scapegoat for these social crimes! Still, a ray of hope shines in the accounts of the people who were pulled into the pogroms and are now facing the consequences. They appear to have seen the downside of the emotional reactions they had shown, and say that such events are unlikely to happen again as they had learnt their lessons. We owe the author thanks for bringing out this work.

Paris climate change agreement enters into force today. Meanwhile,  United Nations Environmental Program has come out with a report that says that even if the Paris Agreement comes into effect we are on track to hit  a global temperature rise of 3.4ºC above pre-industrial levels, far above the 2º limit and 1.5º goal agreed to under last year's Paris climate accord. According to Dr James Hansen, the grandfather of Global Warming science, when  our planet was 2 °C warmer, in the early Pliocene about 3 million years ago, sea level was about 25 m [82 feet] higher than today.  During the Eemian interglacial period of about 130,000 years ago when sea levels were 15 to 20 feet higher, when temperatures had been thought to be about 1°C warmer than today. Remember we are already 1.25 °C warmer than the pre-industrial level! Where are we headed? Do we have a future?

Global warming is on track to top 3° Celsius, the United Nations warned this week, because today's climate pledges are ""not nearly enough"" to prevent dangerous levels of warming. That's according the latest annual ""Emissions GapReport""  from the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), which concluded that pledges to cut emissions will result in a global temperature rise of 3.4ºC above pre-industrial levels, far above the 2º limit and 1.5º goal agreed to under last year's Paris climate accord.

Obama's 'change' became 'more of the same' and the Nobel Peace Laureate has bequeathed seven wars, a refugee crisis in Europe, hundreds of thousands dead, and confrontation with Russia, the other major nuclear power. Amidst all the spewed hatred, Trump's views on Putin and Russia might well diffuse this dangerous tension.

It would not be surprising to say that Arnab Goswami was the trend setter in Indian media industry. He represented a media version with seeds of fascist political culture that was to emerge in India. He was a cross breed of economic and political right. The political culture was to be extremely suppressive of political dissent, rule out any intellectual debates based on reason and logic, be completely subservient to the official version of political events, base judgements on theestablishment version and create a confirmatory rather than a vigilant citizenry.

In Myanmar government has decided to arm and train the non Muslim local people in order to enhance the security in the Rakhine State where the ethnic problems between the Rohingya Muslims and Buddhist residents prevail. The move is being treated as to crush the Rohingya Muslims who have been denied any substantial rights within the state and the ethnic persecution of this tiny community is underway.

Last July, the Palestinian Authority took the unexpected, although belated step of seeking Arab backing in suing Britain over the Balfour Declaration. That 'declaration' was the first ever explicit commitment made by Britain, and the West in general, to establish a Jewish homeland atop an existing Palestinian homeland.

Is Popular Support For Suicide Terrorism Growing In Bangladesh?

It's absurd! It's preposterous to suggest that around 40 per cent of Bangladeshis favour suicide terrorism. Yet this is what some American think tanks and ""expert analysts"" have recently come up with in their reports, to the detriment of Bangladesh's reputation. Muslims in Bangladesh – around 90 per cent of the population – are peaceful, liberal, devotional, and even syncretistic, unlike their counterparts in the Middle East, Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

Can there be a collective search for paradigms and pathways towards a world that is sustainable, equitable and just? How can such frameworks and visions build on an existing heritage of ideas and worldviews and cultures, and on past or new grassroots practice? How can they be fundamentally different from today's dominant economic and political system, which has brought the world to the brink of ecological collapse and the depths of socio-economic inequalities and despair? Can they provide rays of hope in what currently seems to be a worsening situation of social tension and conflicts, the resurgence of regressive right-wing forces, and suffering caused by environmental damage.",Armed Police Descend On Water Protectors At DAPL Site,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/03/armed-police-descend-on-water-protectors-at-dapl-site/,2016-11-03 09:01:45,6,0,4,4,0,1,0,0,1

It's high time to amplify the emotional and spiritual perspective of the Native Voice as it might speak to the American Voter about the woeful Indian treaty history of the United States, and all the doubletalk of its former Presidents and the next one about to be elected. What lies behind the reasons why various disparate issues in American culture – like Gun Control, Climate Change and Native American Rights – are assiduously avoided every time another presidential election comes along, is an ugly truth that strikes at the very heart of ""What Makes America Tick""

Of Uprising And Unrest in Kashmir

One is worried, this current impasse may usher in a new violent phase by throwing up a new breed of radicalized militants. One can only hope, not. But as it seems, no one is really bothered to care about where we are heading. In this respect, the apathy and indifference of the state has to be castigated in full measure, even more than the intransigent politics of the separatist camp. On their part, the separatists need to come out of their obstinate positions to ponder over workable solutions to the political problems the state is facing. Kashmiris are mature enough to make it a point that notwithstanding the massive importance of political struggle to their lives, the struggle for bread is equally important.

 In Villages Women Hold The Reigns

If we want to bring a truly transformative gender revolution, we must remember that all women, regardless of their marital status, need access to education, good jobs, and support for domestic duties. Although transforming long-held laws, beliefs and practices may be difficult, it is the only way to keep price tags off women and ensure that they have dignity as well as true economic agency. . The weaker bargaining position of women gives an upper hand to the male counterpart in any decision-making within the household. By putting financial resources in the hands of women, institutions can help level the playing field and thereby promote gender equality",The Significance Of Marrakech COP22,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/11/02/the-significance-of-marrakech-cop22/,2016-11-02 09:22:03,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

Iraqi government troops entered the eastern outskirts of Mosul Monday, as the US-backed offensive launched October 17 to recapture the country's second largest city from the Islamic State began its third week. But the advances of Iraqi government soldiers, Peshmerga fighters and Sunni and Shia militias could not conceal the fact that growing sectarian tensions are threatening to vastly intensify the bloody conflict in Iraq and Syria and draw the major powers into a direct military clash.

It needs great emotional intensity to break through age old barriers .This can be possible only through groups who share the same emotional values and are driven by   strong impulses of mutual goals.

The Indian State which claims to be committed to get justice to Sikh community for 1984 massacre must look at one crucial document of the period to locate large numbers of perpetrators. This document can be a crucial source of finding out many more sadist killers. This document may throw some light on the unhidden aspects of the genocide. It was authored and circulated by a veteran ideologue of the RSS, Nana Deshmukh on November 8, 1984. Interestingly, this document was published in the Hindi Weekly Pratipaksh edited by George Fernandes (Defence Minister of India 1999-2004 who continued to be a great pal of the RSS) in its edition of November 25, 1984 titled 'Indira Congress-RSS collusion' with the following editorial comment

Dear Friend,

Skirmishes at the border of the two nuclear armed neighbours in South Asia, India and Pakistan, raises the heart beat of the peace loving citizens of the region and the whole world. Today a 54 year old woman was killed by Pakistan's shelling in Poonch district of Jammu & Kashmir. In another cross border shelling in Rajouri district of J & K an army Jawan was killed. Yesterday, an Indian soldier was killed and his body mutilated by militants. Nationalist sentiments are being whipped up in both nations. In India the far right BJP government and its followers are boycotting artists from Pakistan.  They even went so far as to boycott Chinese products  for China's stand on  Kashmir. Meanwhile Kashmir remains shut for 115 days. 

Eight alleged members of the outlawed Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) were killed in an alleged encounter by Madhya Pradesh police today. Many have raised eye brows about the government version. The facts are only emerging. In any case, 'encounter killings' are a routine affair in India. Because of its rampant spread in all parts of India, Supreme Court of India has issued strict guidlines to be followed in the case of encounter killings, including independent enquiry about the encounter. 

Yes, USA is in decline, except may be in its military might. That's why Donald Trump vows to 'make America great again'. Two great scholars warns that the whole world must be worried about this 'declining hegemon'. Dr Chandra Muzaffar from Malaysia, and Professor Richard Falk from USA has almost the same warning. Watch out! Falk further says that the coming US presidential election will have  a huge bearing on the fate of the rest of the world. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/31/the-danger-of-war-from-a-declining-hegemon/

The Danger Of War From A Declining Hegemon
 by Dr Chandra Muzaffar 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/31/the-danger-of-war-from-a-declining-hegemon/

Is a war in the making — a third world war? There are at least two flash points, one more dangerous than the other. In Eastern Ukraine, Russian backed rebels will not surrender to the US supported regime in Kiev because they see US control over Ukraine as part of a much larger agenda to expand NATO power to the very borders of Russia. This has been happening for some years now.

 
What Are We to Think?
 by Richard Falk 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/31/what-are-we-to-think/

The United States does pose a special threat of its own world wide, and is not only menacing its own future. It controls the dominant arsenal of nuclear weapons, it maintains a network of bases spread around the world, militarizes oceans and space, sends its predator drones and special ops kill squads to find prey wherever on the planet it perceives threats. This militarized and unaccountable global security system is reinforced by preeminent diplomatic and economic leverage, and emboldened by a self-serving ideology of 'American exceptionalism,' What happens in the United States is of great, often decisive, importance to the wellbeing of the many countries, especially in the global South, that lack both voice or exit capabilities (Hirschman), and thus find themselves captive of history's first, and possibly, last 'global state.'

Climate (In)justice: Significance of COP 22
by Zeenat Masoodi

The Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is one of the first international instruments to include the term 'climate justice'. While the notion of justice has been explored in several contexts – purely legal, economic, and social –, the visible effects of climate change, most notably in the form of extreme weather events, have led to linking of climate change with human rights.

US Allies Saudi Arabia And Qatar Fund And Equip ISIS, It's Not An Election Issue

Bernie Sanders And Water Under The Bridge

What presently interests me is a thought experiment: What would have happened if Sanders had said yes to Jill Stein's offer of heading the Green Party ticket? She did offer this, and since this is only a thought experiment, let's further suppose that Ms. Stein would have been willing to step away from the second spot in favor of Elizabeth Warren.

Human Potential: The Case of Peter Kropotkin
 by Milan Djurasovic 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/31/human-potential-the-case-of-peter-kropotkin/

Kropotkin wished to build a society whose institutions would stimulate the best instincts of human nature. His examinations of nature lead him to the conclusion that a society constructed in an anarchist communist manner is the best imitation of the most robust animal species. But this was not to be a contrived society that had to be held together through artificial means. Kropotkin was convinced that the human nature longed for it, and that it was best suited for this particular social order.

So yeah I'm a bit frustrated at the Twitter stuff and at our collective inability to change our digital commons for the better.

Is Gandhi Still Relevant?
by Colin Todhunter 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/31/is-gandhi-still-relevant/

Mention Gandhi in certain circles and the response might be one of cynicism: his ideas are outdated and irrelevant in today's world. Such a response could not be further from the truth. Gandhi could see the future impact of large-scale industrialization in terms of the devastation of the environment, the destruction of ecology and the unsustainable plunder of natural resources.

The usage of the word nationalism in the name of boycotting Chinese products is a matter of convenience. Why not boycott all the junk products produced abroad in any country which keep getting advertised on TV through teleshopping. The call for boycotting Chinese products is just another means of creating jingoism through pointing an external enemy and building xenophobia around the same.

Dear Friend,

CNN reported that a Russian fighter jet and a US military plane flew dangerously close to each other while flying over Syria earlier this month. US Air Force Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, who commands US air operations across the Middle East, characterized the incident as a ""near miss."" What a miss! The whole world should heave sigh of relief. 

Yes, we are closer than ever, after the cold war, to a nuclear war. These 'near misses' must be an 'Act of God'! Eminent journalist and documentary maker John Pilger concurs with us in his address at the Sheffield Festival of Words. He says ""Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way – in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target."" He points his finger at the colluding media in spreading the imperialist propaganda. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/29/inside-the-invisible-government-war-propaganda-clinton-and-trump/

US-backed Islamist rebels, dominated by the Al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front, launched a counter offensive against Syrian government troops Friday in Aleppo breaking the 10 day self-imposed ceasfire by Russia and Syria. The offensive was preceded by the indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas in government-controlled western Aleppo. Russian General Sergei Rudskoi reported that 43 civilians were killed and 96 wounded in the days prior to the offensive in rocket and mortar attacks.  Vladimin Putin has refused, at least for now, to be drawn into this provocation.He turned down a Russian military request ro restart  air strikes in East Aleppo.

 In an all out war against the Standing Rock Sioux protesters police arrested 141 people in North Dakota on Thursday. Police moved in with pepper spray and armored tanks on Native American water protectors and other activists who for months have waged resistance against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).

 Inside The Invisible Government: War, Propaganda, Clinton And Trump
 by John Pilger 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/29/inside-the-invisible-government-war-propaganda-clinton-and-trump/

Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties.

Nuclear war is the likely outcome if Hillary Clinton becomes elected President of the United States. It would be practically unavoidable, if she is elected. The domestic U.S. politics that are associated with this shocking but clear fact are complex, but are likewise clear: The American public simply don't know or understand these facts; and the reason they don't is that these facts are hidden from them

This morning, politics is crowded out by injustice. Every preposterous and painful image from North Dakota is another reminder of injustice: The massive military-style police occupation of Standing Rock treaty lands, the rush to protect the frantic construction schedule for the Dakota Access pipeline, and the brutal law enforcement march against people who are fighting for the simple idea that water is life. I'm angry. How shall I say this without ranting? Tell stories.

81307324765_10154683781004766,"Dear Friend,

 CNN reported that in the Mosul offensive 900 ISIS fighters were killed. In war, the first casualty is truth! So, we really don't know if those killed were ISIS fighters or civilians, that too coming from an imperialist propaganda media outlet. CNN also report that many ISIS fighters are fleeing  Syria.  Whether it is deliberate strategy to further destabalise Syria is to be seen. In any case, the imperialist forces have left open an escape route for ISIS fighters to Syria. The report further says that the ultimate target of the imperialist forces is Raqqa in Syria, the so called headquarters of ISIS. An operation inside Syria will further complicate the conundrum in Syria. On the other hand, the fall of Mosul can raise ethnic tensions inside Iraq and may destablise that country as well. 

The Syrian situation and the surrounding of Russian border in Eastern Europe by NATO forces raise the threat of nuclear war, the closest we've come after the end of the Cold War. In this context yesterday's landmark resolution in United Nations calling for a ban on all Nuclear Weapons assumes greater significance. Predictably Britain, France, Russia, Israel and the United States — voted against the resolution while China abstained, as did India and Pakistan. Japan which is the only victim of Nuclear attack voted No, as did South Korea, which is facing a nuclear threat from North Korea. Surprisingly North Korea voted YES. 

Fortunately saner people are speaking up. Mikhail Gorbachev, former leader of the Soviet Union, has appealed for sanity. In an interview with RIA Novosti, Gorbachev said: ""I think the world has reached a dangerous point, I don't want to give any concrete prescriptions, but I do want to say that this needs to stop. We need to renew dialogue. Stopping it was the biggest mistake."" http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/28/mikhail-gorbachev-appeal-for-sanity/

Similarly, how is my Muslim sister at fault if someone just utters talaq thrice over the telephone and destroys her life"". The  indomitable Shamsul Islam deconstructs Modi's statement and concludes that it was Modi, the RSS pracharak speaking, and not the Prime Minister of India.

His overall thesis is that the after-tax rate return on wealth, coupled by sluggish growth, compounds inequality.

Given the above context, the statement by the Prime Minister indicating his concern for minority women is less out of concern for gender justice but guided by saffron agenda of minority targeting. While issues of triple talaq and polygamy need to get addressed, the uniform civil code (UCC) may not necessarily be the means for the same. As being pointed by women's groups, what is required is not uniformity but Gender just laws.

Following the process, thinking seamlessly blends into acts of questions. Moreover, the former acts as a scaffolding to the latter that eventually carries the grain of a new change for common good.

Dear Friend,

The Russian front is sitting on a powder keg. NATO has given green signal to the largest military escalation in the region since the height of the Cold War  and carries with it the heightened threat of an armed confrontation between Washington and Moscow, the world's two largest nuclear powers. The meeting of NATO defense ministers held in Brussels yesterday has thrashed out a plan for deployment of some 4,000 combat troops within striking distance of Russia's border. These front-line forces are to be backed by a 40,000-strong rapid reaction force capable of going into battle within days. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg  stressed  ""an attack on any ally will be considered an attack on us all."" Turkey is bombing Kurdish region inside Syria repeatedly. Syria has vowed that any violation of its airspace will be met with hostility, meaning, Turkish planes will be shot down. Turkey being a NATO member, that is enough pretext for an attack on Russia. Meanwhile Russia has dispatched  an eight-vessel flotilla led by the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov to the eastern Mediterranean to support Russian operations in support of the Syrian government. 

War is madness. If only human beings took a birds eye view of our actions! Dr. Ernest Partridge former professor of Philosophy at the University of California takes a 'Martian Eye View' of 'The New Cold War'. He sees it through the eyes of an imaginary Martian named ""Marty"". Dr Patridge writes ""In the language of game theory, from the point of view of the military-industrial-media complex, the new Cold War is a plus-sum contest – inflated budgets, career advancement, advertising revenues. From the point of view of strategic planners, it is zero-sum: ""if we win, they lose, and if we lose, they win."" From the point of view of humanity in general – and of Marty, the wise and benevolent Martian – the Cold War is minus-sum, threatening infinite loss: total nuclear annihilation."" http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/27/a-martian-view-of-the-new-cold-war/

Countercurrents has been regularly  reporting on the human rights violations on Ahwazi Arab minorities in Iran. Today we have the horrific story of a three-year-old girl, who died instantly on being shot through the heart as she sat in the back of her parents' car when Iranian security forces opened fire indiscriminately on the vehicle .

We are in a race to save ourselves from castrophic climate change. It is imperative that we keep warming below 2 C. If that is to be achieved coal based power generation has to be retired as soon as possible. International Energy Agency reports that renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world. A good news in the midst of all the gloom and doom.

NATO defense ministers convened a two-day meeting in Brussels Wednesday to thrash out final plans for the deployment of some 4,000 combat troops organized in four battle groups within striking distance of Russia's border. These front-line forces are to be backed by a 40,000-strong rapid reaction force capable of going into battle within days.

From the point of view of strategic planners, it is zero-sum: ""if we win, they lose, and if we lose, they win."" From the point of view of humanity in general – and of Marty, the wise and benevolent Martian – the Cold War is minus-sum, threatening infinite loss: total nuclear annihilation.

Renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world, according data released Tuesday by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The transition of the world's energy sources is critical for avoiding a 2°C rise in global temperatures. Coal, for instance, represented about a quarter of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2012.

Ahwazi human rights activists have reported the murder of a three-year-old girl, Raghad Abbas (pictured), who died instantly on being shot through the heart as she sat in the back of her parents' car when Iranian security forces opened fire indiscriminately on the vehicle on Monday October 24th.  Her father, Abbas Hassan Mashal Al-Sari, aged 41, who was driving the car, and her mother, Zahor Abdul-Sada Al-Sari, were also critically wounded in the shootin

Lower Yields And Agropoisons: What Is The Point Of GM Mustard In India?   
by Colin Todhunter 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/27/lower-yields-and-agropoisons-what-is-the-point-of-gm-mustard-in-india/

The decision whether to allow the commercialisation of the first genetically modified (GM) food crop (mustard) in India rumbles on. As I have previously discussed here, the bottom line is government collusion over GM crop technology (that is not wanted and not needed) with transnational agribusiness, which is trying to hide in the background.

Nobel Confusion: Ramos-Horta, Trump And World Disorder
by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/27/nobel-confusion-ramos-horta-trump-and-world-disorder/

Nobel Prize winner and former president of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta, should be more attuned with that recent history. But instead, he has decided to wade into the US elections with another letter of scorn, another experiment in persuasion. To add weight and magnification to the appeal, he is seeking the signatures of fellow Nobel Prize laureates.  The direction of this letter promises to be simple: whatever you do, people of the US, don't vote for Donald Trump next month.

What also caused much fury in Tel Aviv is that UNESCO used the Arabic references to Haram al-Sharif, Al-Aqsa Mosque and other Muslim religious and heritage sites. The same way they would refer to Egypt's Pyramids of Giza and China's Great Wall by their actual names. Hardly anti-Semitic. 

Reality Of SECC-2011 : Unequal Citizens
 by Tata Sivaih

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/27/reality-of-secc-2011-unequal-citizens/

The SECC data should not be put into cold storage. The release of the data is expected to make significant changes not only in the politics of the country but also in the unjust measures of policy formulations established for long, especially for the OBC community, which is expected to witness a revlution from within. And this is the right time for political organisations anmd others to come forward and make collective effort to get our due justice. And I hope that we are capable enough to successfully acheve this done.

 The assault on Mosul has entered second week. A horrific humanitarian disaster is unfolding there. UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a UN meeting Geneva that Iraqi security forces had discovered the bullet-riddled bodies of 70 civilians in the village of Tuloul Naser, near Mosul, on October 20. It was also reported that 50 former police officers being held outside the city had also been killed. People are fleeing from the city. There are also report that ISIS terrorists are fleeing into Syria. 

Sabia Rigby reports from Calais refugee camp In Calais in France which the French and English police are  taking down leaving thousands of refugees totally homeless and stateless.  

Dr Nayvin Gordon delves into US history and explores why the police in US is behaving the way it is. He believes that it is a legacy of the slave system. He asks the whites to join the blacks in their resistance against police brutality. He writes ""Whites will not be free from killer cops until Blacks are also free."" 

The Dalits in India is facing the same kind of racial discrimination that the blacks are facing in USA and elsewhere. Dalits and Muslims  constitue 17% & 13% of the population. That means that together one in three Indians is a 'Dalim' – Dalit Indian Muslim. Yet these two are the most powerless and oppressed communities in the largest democracy in the world. Mirza Yawar Baig puts forward some practical solutions for the upliftment of the 'Dalim'. 

Emminent Indian journalist and author, Ms. Rana Ayyub's talk at the Indian Cultural Centre, Doha on October 22nd was allegedly cancelled by the Embassy of India, Doha, at the very last minute allegedly under pressure from Government of India. 

The CAG report on Vizhinjam Transit Harbour has come out. The report says that the project will put a heavy burden on the government and ultimately on the people and will help only the project developer Gautam Adani, one of the biggest beneficiary of present day crony capitalism that is prevailing in India.  The communist government which came to power promising development without environmental destruction is presiding over one of the greatest environmentally destructive deveoplment projects in Kerala. K.P Sasi, son of K. Damodaran who was one of the founders of the communist party in Kerala writes sarcastically ""Poor Karl Marx. He spent years in writing Das Capital. It still remains as the most powerful critique of capitalism. But he did not imagine that  Communists in Kerala will interpret it differently much later in history using his name.

Sabia Rigby reports from Calais as police are dismantling a camp where refugees wait to cross into Britain. Most of those aiming to claim asylum are from Afghanistan and Syria. The camp has become an impromptu village of sorts, where residents take care of each other. Despite the independent nature of the camp and its non-interference with most of French life, many French citizens and commentators have been angered by the presence of the camp and have pressured the government to dismantle it.

For humane, anti-racist, pro-peace, pro-environment, pro-human rights American voters the Green Party candidate Dr Jill Stein ticks all boxes.

Whites will not be free from killer cops until Blacks are also free.

 Dear Friend,

At lease 59 cadets were killed and more than 116 injured as terrorists attacked the Police Training College in the Quetta, the provincial capital city of  Pakistan's restive Balochistan province.   It seems that the terrorists were handled from Afghanistan. Quetta has a history of such massive tragedies in the recent past. What's different this time is that India has thrown in the hat in the already complicated imbroglio in Balochistan, by Prime Minister Modi's strong posturing on Balochistan. China, USA, Afghanistan all have a big stake in the region. India getting involved in the region could raise the tension between two nuclear armed neighbours, which can escalate into full scale nuclear war. 

Obama administration is discussing ""Plan B"" on Syria. It is significantly increasing the supply of weapons to the so-called rebels, a collection of Al Qaeda-linked Islamist militias. This too has the potential to escalate into a nuclear war between major powers. 

John Spritzler explains why US rulers don't fear World War III with Russia. Quoting security experts well connected with Washington, Spritzler argues that the US ruling establishment believe that they can neutralise a Russian nuclear attack so quickly that it won't have significant impact on USA and its allies. Pipe dream to  lead the world to total annihilation? Whenever you hear about the threat of a nuclear war, our hope that nuclear arms may perhaps  work as a deterrant, may not work since our leaders are hard wired differently. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/25/why-u-s-rulers-dont-fear-nuclear-wwiii-with-russia/

""Plan B""—meant to signal Washington's response to its failure to secure its goal of ""regime change"" by means of a negotiated agreement with Russia, the main ally of the Assad government—would involve significantly increasing the supply of weapons to the so-called rebels, a collection of Al Qaeda-linked Islamist militias.

The Mosul offensive is getting ever more tangled with multiple state and non-state forces vying for power in this complex imbroglio. US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter travelled to Turkish capital Ankara to assuage the miffed Turkey who were denied a role in the Mosul offensive. Turkey duly acknowledged the call and joined the attack on Mosul. Iraqi government, which has previously vowed to attack Turkish troops if they become involved, rebuffed the deal.

ISIS terrorists are fleeing Mosul and escaping to Syria, further complicating the affairs there. Turkey continues to attack Kurdish regions inside Syria. Syria has vowed to shoot down any Turkish plane that violates its air space. If that happens things could go out of hand into a wider war. 

Low scale skirmishes are continuing  in the India-Pakistan border. A Border Security Forces man and an eight-year-old boy were killed and three others injured   as India and Pakistan exchanged heavy fire and shelling in several sectors along the International Border in Jammu district. Meanwhile Pakistan media reported that two people, including a one-year-old baby, were killed and seven others injured in firing by Indian troops. The tension is simmering  between India and Pakistan, anytime it can explode into something horrific. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/24/as-kashmir-faces-humanitarian-crisis-time-to-show-statesmanship/

Tensions between Turkey and Iraq heightened over the weekend as the Iraqi army and Kurdish Peshmerga forces pushed towards the Islamic State-controlled city of Mosul. US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter arrived in Ankara Friday, before traveling to Iraq for meetings in Baghdad Saturday and Irbil, the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) capital yesterday. Carter announced after meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that he had secured an agreement in principle to permit Turkish troops stationed near Mosul to participate in the offensive.

Dear Friend,

Bizarre news is coming from Mosul. AFP reported that ISIS terrorists blew up a sulphur factory in the city and several civilians have died. The coalition forces are inching ahead to the city. 

As we noted yesterday Turkey's bombing of Syria's Kurdish region can trigger a wider war in the region writes Bill Van Auken 

Franklin Lamb writes ""the continuing conflict in Syria has created a devastating humanitarian crisis: the magnitude of humanitarian needs is overwhelming in all parts of the country and affects the region and beyond. The Syrian conflict has become the world's largest humanitarian crisis since World War II, the estimated number of people in need of the protection of International Humanitarian Law is approximately 14 million, more than two-thirds of Syria's pre-war population."" He also points out that the US-EU sanction on Syria is contributing to this crisis. Lamb says that it is a war crime and may be challenged in Internation Criminal Court. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/22/us-led-sanctions-targeting-syria-risk-adjudication-as-war-crimes/

Staying on the imperialist sanctions, Andre Vltchek, the indefatigable chronicler of imperialism reports from Sudan, how that country is affected by decades long western sanctions. 

A campaign is taking shape for people to own Twitter as a co-operative.

Turkish Bombing In Syria Threatens Wider War
by Bill Van Auken 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/22/turkish-bombing-in-syria-threatens-wider-war/

The threat of the US military intervention in Iraq and Syria erupting into a far wider war has increased sharply in the wake of a series of Turkish air strikes against Syrian Kurdish militia forces that are aligned with Washington.

 As many of us would agree, the continuing conflict in Syria has created a devastating humanitarian crisis: the magnitude of humanitarian needs is overwhelming in all parts of the country and affects the region and beyond. The Syrian conflict has become the world's largest humanitarian crisis since World War II, the estimated number of people in need of the protection of International Humanitarian Law is approximately 14 million, more than two-thirds of Syria's pre-war population.

We Never Voted For Corporate Rule
 by David Korten 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/22/we-never-voted-for-corporate-rule/

As individual corporations grow in size, global reach, and political power, we see a corresponding shift in the primary function of national governments—from serving the interests of their citizens to assuring the security of corporate property and profits. They apply police and military powers to this end, subsidize corporate operations, and facilitate corporate tax evasion. They let corporations off the hook with slap-on-the-wrist fines for criminal actions. Rarely, if ever, do they punish top executives.

The fear-inducing clowns have seen a global reach of supposed terror for members of the public, and more specifically, those engaged in rather stretched notions of entertainment. The last laugh, it would seem, lies with those who have brought back the historically sinister aspect to clowning, using very conventional devices.

While a nod to quare studies (i.e., a formulation of queer theory with attention given to race and class) is a move in the right direction, a certain attention also needs to be given to the acronym that enunciates subject formation and calls identities into existence.

On 19 and 20 October 2016 the Supreme Court held its first two days of hearings to review the Hindutva Judgement that had been pending for 20 years. The next hearing is on October 25. In the two days of discussions to kick off a process that according to Supreme Court Advocate Rana Raj K Singh may last up to a year, Chief Justice TS Thakur said ""the essence, the ethos of our constitutional system is secularism… religion and politics don't mix."" For secular democrats the statement is a sweet song of hope following two decades of orchestrated Hindu nationalism in the wake of the Babri Masjid Ram Temple violence

Dear Friend,

The Mosul offensive is progressing on familiar lines. Embedded reporters gushing over the coalition advances, obliterating more than a million people in Mosul except as human shields. Haven't we seen all this before? In Afghanistan, in Iraq, Libya? Isn't it a build up to a genocide and humanitarian disaster? Yes it is, but the wold will not know about it. We'll only see the smiling faces of coalition forces as they score points after point. No death, no destruction. The cameras will not see them. 

However some information will filter out even from MSM  as happened in BBC the other day. It reported ""University of Mosul, once one of the best equipped in the Middle East, is in ruin.  ""The university is completely inoperative and air strikes have made it a difficult place to go. Most of the buildings have been brought down, it's virtually gone."" 

In the mean time, ISIS terrorists have struck in nearby Kirkuk, killing at least 19 people.

 Turkey is fuming. It is miffed that Turkey couldn't get its pound of flesh in Mosul. Turkey responded yesterday with its most intense air attacks on the Kurdish YPG militia in northern Syria. With different sectarian and nationalist interests tugging Mosul in all directions, James Cogan reports that it could open up a cauldron of conflicts. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/21/mosul-offensive-stirs-a-cauldron-of-conflicts/

Thousands are fleeing from Mosul. What about the millions who fled Iraq after the imperialist intervention in the country? Cathy Breen tells the story of Mohammed and Ahmed from Iraq who fled to Europe and sought shelter in Finland. It is a heart-wrenching story. Mohammed and Ahmed are representatives of hundreds of thousands of refugees in Europe. They all will have similar stories to tell. The world should hear their stories. Countercurrents is willing to tell these stories, if only more people like Cathy Breen would come forward to record them. 

Finally the absurd drama of US presidential debate is over. The most important, burning issue in the mind all the CC readers was not discussed, not even a single time. Climate Change! With leaders like these, we are on the road to perditon, unless, we the people step up, and speak out.

 Mosul Offensive Stirs A Cauldron Of Conflicts
 by James Cogan 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/21/mosul-offensive-stirs-a-cauldron-of-conflicts/

The assault is unfolding amid uncritical media coverage, with embedded journalists filing reports that in general laud the success of Kurdish and Iraqi forces in the face of supposed fanatical resistance and suicide attacks by ISIS defenders. Vast columns of black smoke rising over the battle zones are universally attributed to ISIS igniting oil wells and mounds of tyres to obscure their movements from aerial detection and attack.

I've written often about our Iraqi refugee friend and his oldest son from Baghdad. I will call them Mohammed and Ahmed. They made the torturous flight last year from Baghdad to Kurdistan and then across Turkey. They were on three Greek islands before permission was granted them to continue their trip. They passed through several countries at the time the borders were being closed. They arrived finally at their destination in late September 2015. Finland.

Hideousness is only one word that covers the third and last presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. But prior to that, as a warm up of mischief, Trump was insisting that he would find accepting a public vote for Clinton hard to stomach at the electoral level.  The only way he would accept any electoral result would be, in fact, if he won.

The Mosul offensive, according to Iraqi Prime Minister, is moving ahead better than expected. The troops are capturing the roads leading upto the city and the surrounding villages. But Turkey is not amused. The US led offensive has kept Turkey out of it, instead Turkey's pain in the ass Kurdish  Peshmerga fighters are actively participating in the offensive. Moreover, the western part of the city is left unguarded. The ISIS terrorists could escape to Syria via this opening and further complicating the Syrian imbroglio.  A visibly upset Turkish President  Erdogan has come down hardly on the US policy and even staked a claim on the Balkans. Greece angrily retorted to Erdogan's rhetoric. So tension is flaring up in the whole region. What needs to be seen is that will it spread into a wider conflict or will good senses prevail over rhetoric and chest thumping.

Finally some good news from Aleppo, the besieged city in Syria! Syrian Government is in the final stages of securing a Reconciliation plan for East Aleppo. The main bone of contention is who will absorb the ISIS terrorists. Apparently there is also a deal on the table in the UN Security Council to rescue the foreign fighters of Al Nusra/Al Qaeda/Fatah Al Sham. Perhaps the UN arrangement to secure foreign (Al Nusra) fighters is slowing down the final settlement. 

 There is a #RallyForAleppo outside Downing Street tomorrow. There is a chance for those in an around London to raise their voice for peace. 

Today is the fifth anniversary of the brutal murder of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Libya one of the most developed countries in Africa was destroyed to smithereens. Millions became refugees. ""We Came, We Saw, He Died"" Killary is going to be the next president of USA!  The situation in Libya is now far worse than it was five years ago, as rival militias fighting for control.

Today is 104th day of shut down in Kashmir. 94 persons were killed; over 15,000 were injured; 780 people were hit with the pellets in the eyes with many losing eyesight permanently.

The scene, in short, is set for a violent re-capture, followed by a sorting out of scores, mostly at the end of the gun.  The pattern was set in the retaking of Fallujah last spring.  Iranian-backed Shiite forces joined the Iraqi government forces, enthused by the prospect of victory.  Even before the dust had settled, summary executions by the hundreds had taken place.  In such a retributive climate, the lust for hot blooded vengeance will continue being strong.

Reconciliation For Aleppo?

A little bird just whispered in my ear that the Syrian Government is in the final stages of securing a Reconciliation plan for East Aleppo.  The buses are waiting, my friend said.   According to Al Masdar, a Syrian news outlet, the SAA are holding the high ground in Aleppo. There are a few details to be resolved, but it appears that Syrian national fighters who wish to continue fighting will be bused out of town, and those who wish to lay their arms down will be given amnesty and returned to the civilian population.  Civilians will then be escorted to safety so that the field will be clear for a final battle with foreigners and those determined to stand to the end.

 The Assault on Mosul is slowly gaining momentum. Advancing troops have captured 20 villages from Islamic State. However, a Peshmerga general has said that it will take at least two months to take control of the city. Even President Obama is circumspect. ""Mosul will be a difficult fight and there will be advances and setbacks. Executing will be difficult and no doubt there will be instances where we see some heartbreaking circumstances. …. "" Confessions of the hitman who manufactured it in the first place!

Dr. Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies tweeted ""With data now available through September, 2016 annual record (~1.25ºC above late 19th [century]) seems locked in.""

Israel's Bogus History Lesson
by Jonathan Cook 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/19/israels-bogus-history-lesson/

It was presumably intended as an Israeli history lesson to the world. A video posted to social media by Israel's foreign ministry shows an everyday Jewish couple, Jacob and Rachel, in a home named the ""Land of Israel"". A series of knocks on the door brings 3,000 years of interruptions to their happiness. First it's the Assyrians, followed by the Babylonians, Hellenists, Arabs, Romans, Crusaders, Mamluks, and Ottomans – all straight out of Monty Python central casting.

Zionism Is Racism
by Dr Ludwig Watzal 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/19/zionism-is-racism/

Hardly any knowledgeable person doubts that Zionist ideology is the purest form of racism. Zionism is Jewish disguised racism as a raison d'etat. Israel comes right after the U. S., as far as racism is concerned. That is why the U. S. donates to this racist regime $ 3.8 bn per year in order to keep this occupation regime going. Should anybody doubt the racism of the Israeli leadership, read the following article.

Nauru, Refugees And The Torture Complex
 by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/19/nauru-refugees-and-the-torture-complex/

A closer look at the spectacle that is Nauru's processing facility suggests a few illusions which the propaganda preachers have been at pains to engender. The pedantic will draw upon the point that those in the facility are not technically detained, being allowed, like protected animals in an enclosed safari park, to wander around – within reason.

The Appalling U.S. Presidential Election
by Dr Arshad M Khan 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/19/the-appalling-u-s-presidential-election/

On the eve of the last presidential debate, some observations on this unique election are in order.  In the forty years I have been following US presidential elections, I have never seen a more crass, a more vulgar and for most citizens a more embarrassing election campaign.  Bimbos to the left of them, bimbos to the right of them, onward charged the two candidates — with apologies to Lord Tennyson.

With ethnic uprisings spreading across an Ethiopia now ruled by martial law there is only one nationally based organization in place to lead the eventual regime change in the country and that is the revolutionary Islamic movement.

Dear Friend,

 The assault on Mosul is underway in Iraq. The coalition forces claim to have captured 9 villages surrounding the city. CNN reports of gunfire and suicide bombings by ISIS. American Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, the commander of US and allied forces in Iraq and the de-facto commander of the entire operation, stated yesterday that the siege of Mosul ""will likely continue for weeks, possibly longer."" We are already seeing a siege in Aleppo, Syria and the blood bath therein. What's going to unfold in a city of 1.5 million people that includes 600,000 children? The masters of war are winning!

We, 'The Human Beings',  collectively have unleashed a war on our planet. Satya Sagar looks at this war from within our own body and from outside. This is an adaptation of a speech he delivered at a conference of the People's Health Movement in Cochabamba, Bolivia. He asks what are we 'Human Beings' made of? How we come to be what we are? How we came to dominate the whole earth system? The answers are interesting. He concludes by saying, ""What all this points to is the deep connection between the human species, the planet and other species – we are manifestations of each other and our origins and destinies are identical. That is why when we wound the planet grievously by excavating its treasures –the gold, mineral and oil, destroy its ability to breathe by converting forests into urban wastelands, poison its waters with toxic wastes and exterminate other living organisms – we are in fact doing all this to our own bodies.""

The fossil fuel industry is getting a subsidy of whopping  $5.2 trillion a year for wrecking our planet and the life forms within it, for which our future generations will never forgive us. Unless we rein in the fossil fuel industry we are doomed, writes  Chaitra Yadavar.

 Jon Kofas questions the fourth pillar of democracy, the media, on its integrity. As we all know Mainstream Media is the tool of the elites and the powerful to subdue us commoners by diverting us from real issues and giving us false promises. He says, ""This essay examines whether the media undermines social justice in its incessant effort to sustain the bourgeois social order and institutional structure of which it is an integral part. In this respect, the media's goal the question is whether the media attempts to inform and educate or create robo-citizens and keep them in a zombie-like state.""

US-Backed Iraqi Forces Tighten Noose Around Mosul
by James Cogan 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/18/us-backed-iraqi-forces-tighten-noose-around-mosul/

The first 24 hours of the US-directed assault on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-held city of Mosul in Iraq has shed further light on the calculated and murderous character of the operation. Tens of thousands of Kurdish and Iraqi Army forces have begun a slow advance on the city, tightening a noose around the estimated 5,000 ISIS fighters and up to 1.5 million civilians, including 600,000 children, who are trapped inside.

Your Hard-Earned Money Is Going Towards Subsidies For The Biggest Pollutors- Big Oil companies
 by Chaitra Yadavar 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/18/your-hard-earned-money-is-going-towards-subsidies-for-the-biggest-pollutors-big-oil-companies/

Even today, the fossil fuel industry remains one of the biggest contributors to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, raising the temperature of the earth by 1.5 degrees which is lethal for life to survive. For these 'Big Oil' companies are bringing about an economic cost for the world in terms of impact of climate change. But these companies are not required to pay that cost. The poorest nations, the low lying countries are the ones who are bearing the brunt and paying the costs.

Corporate Media, 'Robo-Citizens' And Bourgeois Democracy
 by Jon Kofas 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/18/corporate-media-robo-citizens-and-bourgeois-democracy/

In this brief essay, I examine the degree to which the media as a guardian and promoter of the status quo hinders the broader public interest in favor of the elites. Although this ought to be self evident because the very rich own media corporations, it is far from the case. The media's self-ascribed role as the 'Fourth Estate', guardian of truth and public welfare, presents the image of neutrality. This essay examines whether the media undermines social justice in its incessant effort to sustain the bourgeois social order and institutional structure of which it is an integral part. In this respect, the media's goal the question is whether the media attempts to inform and educate or create robo-citizens and keep them in a zombie-like state.

Will ""They"" Really Try To Kill President Duterte?

Rodrigo Duterte, the outspoken President of the Philippines has by now, most likely, joined the concealed, prestigious and permanent hit list of the Empire. The hit list isvery long; it hasalready been long for several decades. One could easily lose count and get confused: how many personalities have been marked and secretly condemned to death? How many of them actually died? It reads like a catalogue of illustrious world leaders:from Patrice Lumumba (Zaire), Mohammad Mosaddegh (Iran), Hugo Chavez (Venezuela), Sukarno (Indonesia),Juvénal Habyarimana(Rwanda), Salvador Allende (Chile)toMuammar Gaddafi (Libya), Al-Basheer(Sudan) and Fidel Castro (Cuba), to name just a very few.

In a recent open letter (containing all references to the following reports/sources) to Acting Chief Executive of the World Wild Fund for Nature-UK (WWF-UK) Glyn Davies, campaigner Dr Rosemary Mason states that instead of curbing the use of such chemicals, the agrochemicals industry seems to be under the impression it is the government's role to maximise their use. She adds that the UK still uses aerial spraying as an exemption from EU recommendations.

Canada Goes To War – Trudeau Postures For The UN
 by Jim Miles 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/18/canada-goes-to-war-trudeau-postures-for-the-un/

For Canada and Trudeau to attempt to corral the western Mainstream media message into the UN is simply political posturing. Whether it comes from wilful ignorance and arrogance, simple ignorance, simple stupidity, or a pretty boy posturing as the good guy Canadian mediator is difficult to discern. But it is definitely posturing – it is the U.S. that has created the mess in the MIddle east, it is the U.S./NATO that has created the belligerence towards Russia, it is the U.S. military/industrial/political/financial complex that has created a world of fear and terror in order to attempt its global hegemony. 

Neither War Nor Peace: Shimon Peres, Israel And History
 by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/18/neither-war-nor-peace-shimon-peres-israel-and-history/

Political figures in the Middle East tend to be highly evolved chameleons, adeptly changing colours in far more skilled fashion than clumsy tigers hiding spots they can never remove.  This adjustment saw Peres morph from dedicated war maker and military builder to agent of reconciliation, though few were fooled by this change of heart. Those with sufficiently long memories recall the firm backer of Israeli settlements in the West Bank in the 1970s.

Promoting Enmity On Grounds Of Religion Is A Corrupt Practice
 by Anandi Sharan 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/18/promoting-enmity-on-grounds-of-religion-is-a-corrupt-practice/

When conducting an enquiry when charges of corrupt practices under section 123 (3-A) of the Representation of People Act 1951 are levelled, judges should remember that the law means that it is illegal for someone to promote or attempt to promote, feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens of India on grounds of religion, race, caste, community, or language when trying to get themselves elected to public office. And once they are in public office it is illegal for them to engage in such deeds.  The day may come soon when we convict Narendra Modi for the corrupt practice of promoting enmity under the Act.

 Dear Friend,

The long planned assault on Iraqi city of Mosul has begun. Mosul has a civlian population of 1.5 million, including 600,000 children. Behind-the-scenes, the US military is monitoring and effectively commanding the onslaught. American, British, French, Australian and Jordanian jet fighters and helicopters are providing air support to the disparate government forces.

In a major shift to geopolitical alliances in the region Gwadar Port in the Balochistan province of Pakistan became operational and the first Chinese ship docked in the port on Sunday. It's a major breakthrough for China geopolitcally as well as strategically. Now China can't be isolated by closing the Malacca straits. It also opens a pathway to oil rich Central Asian region. Gwadar port will punch a big whole in USA's pivot to Asia strategy. India won't be amused to see Pakistan inching closer to China, especially with PM Modi's recent Balochistan remarks. 

Documentary filmmaker and journalist Deia Schlosberg was arrested and charged with felonies carrying a whopping maximum sentence of up to 45 years in prison—simply for reporting on the ongoing Standing Rock Sioux protest. It's more than what Edward Snowden could get! Democracy Now's Amy Goodman faces arrest allegedly for ""participating in a 'riot' "", also for reporting the Standing Rock protest. What happened to the first Amendment?  Today a  similar story emerged  from UK as well, where Russia Today's bank accounts were freezed. 

Seed Freedom faces another threat. The proposed trade deal between EU and Canada – the Comprehensive Trade and Economic Agreement ( CETA) embeds a controversial commitment to push for more corporate control of seeds.

When corporates are taking more and more control of our agriculture what we really need is an agroecological revolution writes, Kirtana Chandrasekaran.  Thousands of small producers are already practicing agroecology. Yet to ignite the global shift in farming practices we so desperately need, governments need to step up. 

Carolyn Baker  writes  a review of Michael Brownlee's book ""The Local Food Revolution: How Humanity Will Feed Itself In Uncertain Times"". In this book,  Brownlee is inciting a local food revolution, and this revolution is far more expansive, far more radical, and far more life-altering than creating a few farmers markets and promoting one's local economy. A true counter revolution to the plans of the agrochemical coporations.

The proposed trade deal between EU and Canada – the Comprehensive Trade and Economic Agreement (or CETA for short) is hurtling towards completion. CETA has attracted as much opposition as the more widely known TTIP (EU-US trade deal) as it shares the same problems of undermining democracy and threatening public services. But buried on page 164 of the CETA agreement in legal jargon is clause 20.31 which embeds a controversial commitment to push for more corporate control of seeds.

To call others into environmentalism, we should therefore appeal to the same love in them. It is not only ineffectual but also insulting to offer someone a venal reason to act ecologically when we ourselves are doing it for love

We have also seen that violence was meant to inspire the demoralized masses to do away with those who oppressed them, but we have not yet fully explored based on what moral ground were the acts of violence justified. I believe that a more comprehensive answer to this question ought to be looked for in Kropotkin's stance on morality and human nature, which is going to be the topic of my next article.

81307324765_10154639054734766,"Dear Friend,

 Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif put forward a proposal to going to the tables if India is serious about Kashmir. Will India accept the proposal? With state elections around the corner, and the flagging popularity of Narendra Modi government in India, it's unlikely that India will accept the Pakistani proposal. All the peace loving people of the world should put pressure on the political leadership of India and Pakistan to go to the negotiating table to avoid a catastrophic war. 

After 99 days, curfew was lifted across Kashmir. However, restrictions on the assembly of people under Section 144 CrPc are in force throughout the Valley. At least 94 people were killed by security forces in the valley in those 99 days. 

Zeenat Masoodi writes from Srinagar,  ""400 ppm CO2: The Case For Renewable Energy"". It's so humbling to see someone writes about the plight of the planet in the midst of all these mayhem in Kashmir. Zeenat writes, ""climate change is a ticking time bomb. If left unchecked, it will spare no one. But we can counter it successfully through the renewable energy revolution. And it can start with the single step of spreading climate change education and awareness in our communities."" http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/15/400-ppm-co2-the-case-for-renewable-energy/

That's exactly what the Standing Rock protesters in USA and the villagers of Hazaribag in India are doing. Fighting and even laying down their lives to keep the fossil fuel in the ground.  In his article ""The Secret Strength of Standing Rock"" Michael J Dax says that Standing Rock protest has become a rallying point for a whole lot of issues that needs urgent course currection for the future of our planet. 

""The healthy function of society requires that governments be accountable to the electorate and that corporations in turn be accountable to democratic governments. Our ability to deal with every other issue of our time—from climate disruption to inequality to violence—depends on that accountability"" - writes David Korten. The monetisation of our lives, livelihoods and our resources is the elephant in the room and nobody is talking about it and with each passing day we become slave to these slave masters and the earth becomes a worse place. 

Franklin Lamb reports from the besieged Aleppo on the defamation campaign against rescue workers in Syria. Recently the White Helmet rescue workers came under attack from a section of the media. Franklin Lamb says that it's without a trace of evidence and these people doing a great disservice to society and the courageous rescue workers of Syria. 

There  is a chance that ongoing war in Syria could explode into something bigger. All the major powers are involved in Syria and there is a chance of power realignment in the region with Turkey cosying upto Russia and the chance of a pull out from NATO. The 'No Fly Zone' demand from NATO with the strong backing of ""We Came, We Say, He Died"" Hillary Clinton was discussed in UK House of Commons in an emergency session on Tuesday. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson  urged members to remember that ""the mills of justice grind slowly, but they grind small"".  He had held to the firm line, at least so far, that no-fly zones were simply too risky a proposition, an open invitation to expanded conflict and dangerous encounters. What if Hillary Clinton becomes the next POTUS?

I had suggested last year that the General Assembly should form a multi-national panel comprising various governments from the different continents which as the representative voice of the world would seek a formal meeting with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives and the majority leader of the US Senate to convey to them the strong feelings of the people of the planet that sanctions against Cuba should be lifted at once. It is important for the UN to convey this message to the US leaders especially at this moment because there would be some changes in the US Congress and a new President in the White House after the 8 November 2016 election.

The People's Forum on BRICS that took place in Goa on the 13th and 14th of Goa witnessed several social movements and civil society formations, representing the people of at least 10 countries, make a declaration towards the official 8th BRICS summit in Goa. The declaration has urged upon the BRICS nations to look at issues of Social, Economic and Environmental justice and has reminded the BRICS leadership of a time of an unprecedented crisis facing humanity and nature.

Mahishasur In The North, Ravan Leela In The South
by Cynthia Stephen 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/15/mahishasur-in-the-north-ravan-leela-in-the-south/

The ongoing Mahishasur movement in North India has stirred up the Dravidian subconscious in south India. This year, on the day of Dussehra, effigies of Ram, Sita and Lakshman were burnt in Chennai. Eleven Periyar supporters who dodged a large police presence to burn the effigies were arrested. These Periyarites have been demanding a ban on the practice of burning Ravan's effigies and insulting Dravidians in Delhi and other parts of North India",400 ppm CO2: The Case For Renewable Energy,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/15/400-ppm-co2-the-case-for-renewable-energy/,2016-10-15 10:21:55,3,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0
81307324765_10154635444824766,"Dear Friend,

 The spectre of a nuclear war hangs over South Asia. The politicians are playing a dangerous game. If peace loving, sensible people don't step up this could lead to a catastrophe South Asia and the world can't afford. 

Major General S.G. Vombatkere who has years of experience in military administration and also on the battle field writes that avoiding a war is doable, if only ""right-thinking citizens in India and Pakistan speak up and prevail upon their respective governments to de-escalate tensions and begin talks, rein in the war-mongering sections of the media and the public, and initiate appropriate diplomatic measure"". 

South Asia has become a quagmire, with a lot of geopolitical realignments. USA with its pivot to Asia considers India as an ally with its recently inked  Strategic Partnership with India. On the other hand India's traditional ally Russia is building bridges with Pakistan, and they even conducted a military exercise together recently. China, another nuclear power with whom India fought a losing war, considers Pakistan as a strategic partner. Gwadar port in Baloch province of Pakistan is going to be a lifeline for China if tensions rise in the South China sea. In comes Indian PM Narendra Modi and pulls his weight behind Balochistan freedom struggle! Will Pakistan be amused? Will China be amused? Where will all this lead with all four nuclear powers of the world involved? 

Junaid S. Ahmad of JUST international, Malaysia quotes Noam Chomsky  and warns that it has been a miracle that nuclear weapons have not been used again since the US deployed them in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. That miracle may no longer be sustained if imperial hegemony and its geopolitical theatrics continue to value domination over the survival of the human race. He appropriately titles his article ""Kashmir And 'Pivoting' Toward A Nuclear Holocaust"". Yes, Kashmir is central to all this imbroglio. Indian government has successfully taken the eyes of the world off the suffering of Kashmiris, with its cross border Strategic Strikes. Now its all jingoism and war hysteria. Kashmir is forgotten. 

It's day 98 since normalcy left Kashmir. Clashes and shoot outs are taking place in different parts of Kashmir. Imran Khan a psychologist from Kashmir writes ""peace building should be the priority of all stake holders rather than war rhetoric, emotional provoking and threatening speeches.  Neither integral part nor jugular vein, Kashmir is a humanitarian issue which needs to be resolved in accordance with the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.""

Linh Dinh who taught in a university in Germany last year and wrote from there for CC sends in this mail,

Hi Binu,

I send you an update from Germany. It's very depressing.

Linh

Yes, it is. Please go throgh Linh Dinh's update from Germany. It's a reflection of the churnings in Europe in the face of the large influx of refugees. With more wars, famine, climate change in the offing, it's a microcosom of a future world. Where are we heading?

Well, everything is not lost. There are courageous people who stand up to injustice. We've two such stories today. One from Australia and another from US-Mexico border. 

While Australia slept, John Salisbury, a true gentleman activist from Melbourne, rose daily to the moral occasion of walking the tough 300 kilometres from the Sydney Opera House to Canberra, the seat of the Australian parliament. There, on 11 October, he presented to Maria Vamakinou MP, head of Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, petitions to ask the Australian government to recognise Palestine. Thanks to Dr Vacy Vlazna for bringing this story of true grit and courage. 

Many US military veterans are sperated from their family and deported to Mexico. On the morning of Oct. 8, a group of US veterans who were deported to Mexico congregated in Plaza Ochoa, Nogales, Sonora. They were joined by members of Dreamer Moms International, which advocates for women deported while their children stayed in the U.S., by the Mesoamerica Migrants' Movement, and by other solidarity activists from both sides of the border. They marched across the border joined the fellow activists from Mexico. It was unique moment of solidarity for justice. 

We've heard about water wars. What about food? We fight for water but die of hunger! With multiple cirses converging, food security is vital for the vast majority of human beings on earth. Sad thing is that food is being commoditised and increasingly controlled by market and transnational corporations. Was that the case for most of human history? The answer is a big NO! How did we come to where we are? What's the way out? Jose Luis Vivero Pol who is an anti-hunger activist and agricultural engineer points out that food is in greater part is a commons.  Traditional agricultural knowledge accumulated after thousands of years of practices, agricultural knowledge produced by national research institutions, cooking recipes and national gastronomy, ocean fish stocks, wild fruits and animals, genetic resources for food and agriculture, food safety considerations and maintaining food price stability and attaining global food security are all part of the Commons. Jose Luis Vivero Pol argues that a Commons based strategy with government regulation and market support may ensure food security. He ends the article "" I do not expect to see this change during my lifetime, but I hope my descendants may.""

And also more stories from around the world.

Dispel The Spectre Of War: It Is Doable
by S G Vombatkere  

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/14/dispel-the-spectre-of-war-it-is-doable/

Today, the Indian sub-continent is teetering on the edge of war. It is therefore the crying need of the hour for all right-thinking citizens in India and Pakistan to speak up and prevail upon their respective governments to de-escalate tensions and begin talks, rein in the war-mongering sections of the media and the public, and initiate appropriate diplomatic measures without, at the same time, lowering the military guard. This is eminently doable if military efficiency and prowess is not subordinated to domestic or international political expediency

Crowdsourcing The Food Commons Transition: De-Commodifying Food One Movement At A Time
by Jose Luis Vivero Pol 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/14/crowdsourcing-the-food-commons-transition-de-commodifying-food-one-movement-at-a-time/

Finding the adequate equilibrium between this tri-centric institutional setup to govern food production, distribution and consumption will be one of the major challenges the humankind will have to address in the XXI century, as long as the population grows and Earth's carrying capacity seems to be surpassed by human's greed for resources, as Ghandi once mentioned. A fairer and more sustainable food system is possible, but we need to reconsider the food narrative to be applicable to transit towards that goal. I do not expect to see this change during my lifetime, but I hope my descendants may

When the neo-cons in the UK parliament and the serial warmonger Hillary Clinton call for a ""no-fly zone"" they actually mean the opposite. They mean that NATO should be given untrammelled access to the [Syrian] airspace to carry out mass bombings – but that nobody else [including the Syrian government] should.

The war drums are being sounded ever louder in the nuclear South Asia. There is an eerie resemblance to what happens before every war. We've seen it before the Afghan, Iraq, Kargil..... The hate talk, media hysteria, valorisation of the soldier and most of all 'making up of an enemy'. War mongers are ruling the roost and peace mongers are too few and far between. Fortunately we've a few here. K.P. Sasi, eminent film maker and activist writes that it's time for people who believe in justice, peace and harmony in India and Pakistan to come out and put an end to this growing war mania. He asks the question, ""If the people across the boundaries can not protect their peace, then who else can?"" 

Prof Ranjit Goswami focuses that the media, blinded by nationalism, has forgotten journalistic ethics. He cautions ""manufacturing hysteria of war-cries, which may, inadvertently, put pressure on the government as well as on the military, does not serve nation's true interests.""

 Indian Motion Producers Association (IMPPA) has banned Pakistani artists and technicians from working in Indian film industry. Suhail Qasim Mir says it's going to be self defeating since amidst all animosity and hatred between India and Pakistan, it is the cinema which connects the two countries. He writes, ""terrorists thrive on hatred; love and engagement defeats them. By banning artists, India is trying to defeat engagement and thereby ensuring triumph of terrorists.""

 #SaveHinduismFromHalfPants was a campaign Countercurrents.org ran in October 2015 in association with CPI (Mohammad Rafi) .

The ever reliable Gail Tverberg analyses World Economic Outlook released by IMF from an energy persepective. In fact, IMF only confirms what Gail has been writing and warning us for long! The conclusion of IMF is that  debt crisis is growing to  unmangeable level. Gail predicts a debt crisis and an eventual economic melt down. Something we don't want to hear. I sincerely hope that Gail's prediction goes wrong.

Between The Buddhists And The Yuddhists
by K P Sasi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/13/between-the-buddhists-and-the-yuddhists/

Time has come for those who believe in justice, peace and harmony in India and Pakistan to come out and put an end to this growing war mania. Time has come for the civil society, human rights activists, film personalities, writers, poets and cultural personalities on both sides to raise their voices with realisation that if such an action is not undertaken now the war mongers will play with our lives. Time has come to unite against the Yuddhists in India and Pakistan and to generate a strong public message that the sensational mainstream media, the corrupt army officials, and the politicians with their dwindling power mechanism and shrinking images on both sides do not own the share market of our freedom, peace and harmony. Time has come to isolate the Yuddhists on both sides. If the people across the boundaries can not protect their peace, then who else can?

Lack Of Journalistic Ethics, Now Blinded By Nationalism
 by Prof Ranjit Goswami 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/13/lack-of-journalistic-ethics-now-blinded-by-nationalism/

The same nationalistic media, more so the TV news ones, often in the recent past, in general, got dubbed; and its celebrity-like news-anchorstrolled for being 'paid media', which, realistically as well as ideally, should never happen. At the same time, none in the Indian news-media industry can deny the intensity and the prevalence of unethical media. When same media which failed in its tests on ethics today cheerlead or succumb to jingoism – one must be sceptical on the root causes of the driving forces, as it may not be purely journalistic motives that led to many of these misreportings. More importantly, manufacturing hysteria of war-cries, which may, inadvertently, put pressure on the government as well as on the military, does not serve nation's true interests.

Amidst all animosity and hatred between India and Pakistan, it is the cinema which connects the two countries.

 Why Energy Prices Are Ultimately Headed Lower; What The IMF Missed
 by Gail Tverberg 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/13/why-energy-prices-are-ultimately-headed-lower-what-the-imf-missed/

In the not-too-distant future, our low commodity price problem is likely to become a low asset price problem. Once this happens, we will have a huge debt default problem. It will also become harder to obtain new loans, because defaults on existing loans will have an adverse impact on the ability of banks to make new loans. Interest rates required by bond markets are likely to spike as well.

A Nonviolent Strategy to End the Climate Catastrophe
 by Robert J Burrowes 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/13/a-nonviolent-strategy-to-end-the-climate-catastrophe/

Consider our synergistic and devastating assaults on the environment through military violence (often leaving vast areas uninhabitable), rainforest destruction, industrial farming, mining, commercial fishing and the spreading radioactive contamination from Fukushima. We are also systematically destroying the limited supply of fresh water on the planet which means that water scarcity is becoming a frequent reality for many people and the collapse of hydrological systems is now likely by 2020. Human activity drives 200 species of life (plants, birds, animals, fish, amphibians, insects, reptiles) to extinction each day and 80% of the world's forests and over 90% of the large fish in the ocean are already gone. Despite this readily available information, governments continue to prioritize spending $US2,000,000,000 each day on military violence, the sole purpose of which is to terrorize and kill fellow human beings.

How could anyone celebrate a human like this deplorably unethical one?""

Staying on the same topic on a larger canvas  Nozomi Hayase writes ""Tasting the bitterness of our own bleeding hearts awakens us to the sins we have committed against ourselves and lets us rediscover our own humanity. A new world is being born. We hear the silent pulse of our heart that has been guarded by Natives -the custodians of our future.""

There is a lot of hand-wringing by the media over Trumps misogynist remarks. Christian Christensen, a Professor of Journalism at Stockholm University, asks isn't the media also a culprit in creating this misogynist atmosphere?

Everyone has heard about the Standing Rock Sioux protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. But how many people have heard about the tragic but valiant fight of the villagers against coal mines in Hazaribagh in Jharkhand, India? Five poor peasants died in police firing on peaceful protesters on October 1st. The villagers are still living in fear and shock. They say they will not go down without a fight. It's time the world woke up and extended their solidarity to their valiant struggle, to protect their livelihoods, our environment and to keep the fossil fuels in the ground.

In the recent past India is going through a great churning. The Hindutva fanatics are trying to destroy the cultural mosaic of India but destroying communal harmony. This is done through ideological manouerings, fascist thuggishness and even open violence with the open support of the governments in power. India is a resilient country. Whole of India is resisting. Fascism can not take root in India. One example of it comes from Lucknow.A unique Ramlila, is being staged since 1972, where lead characters like Rama, Lakshman and Hanuman are played by Muslim youths. These unique gestures of religious harmony must be celebrated by all who care about the idea of India.

 The Truth About Christopher Columbus 
by Matt Blitz 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/10/the-truth-about-christopher-columbus/

Today, Christopher Columbus is celebrated as a mythical hero by some – complete with songs, poems, and fictional tales about his great adventure across the Atlantic to explore the majestic land that would eventually be known as the Americas. There are fifty four communities named after the explorer in the United States, including the District of Columbia. ""Hail, Columbia"" was the United States' unofficial national anthem until 1931. A federal holiday, ""Columbus Day,"" is celebrated every second Monday in October.

Corporate Plunder And Conquest Of The Governed

Tasting the bitterness of our own bleeding hearts awakens us to the sins we have committed against ourselves and lets us rediscover our own humanity. Out of this dying empire that stretched out to the four corners of the Earth, paths that once diverged have come together. At the center of this crossroad, a new world is being born. We hear the silent pulse of our heart that has been guarded by Natives -the custodians of our future.

Trump's Misogyny And The Media's ""Righteous-Indignation Dollar""
by Christian Christensen 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/10/trumps-misogyny-and-the-medias-righteous-indignation-dollar/

As I watch large portions of the media hand-wring over Trump, without a serious discussion of the role of the media itself in creating the hostile, sexist environment within which Trump's grotesque worldview can flourish, it is worth asking if the coverage is in large part about the righteous-indignation dollar.

The flame-like tree and yellow stars from Van Gogh's Starry Night burn on B.B.'s right shoulder. Blonde, slim and 33, she bartends at Friendly Lounge twice a week. She calls everyone ""darling,"" as in, ""Are you good, darling? You need another one?""

Days after the Jharkhand police opened fire on farmers protesting land acquisition for coal mines by the National Thermal Power Corporation in Badkagaon, Hazaribagh, on 1st October 2016 resulting in several deaths, the demonstrators are still shocked at what they claim was the excessive use of force by the administration.

A Unique Ramlila

We need to remind ourselves that a unique Ramlila, is being staged since 1972, at Bakshi Ka Talab, about 20 km from Lucknow, where lead characters like Rama, Lakshman and Hanuman are played by Muslim youths, a clear departure in a region known for communal flare-ups. This four-day Ram Lila starts on the day of Dusshera day, and has also been adapted into a Radio play, 'Us Gaon ki Ram Lila', by Lucknow All India Radio, which won the Communal Harmony Award in 2000.

Women Protect Common Forest Rights in Rajasthan
by Soma KP

Nichlagarh, an adivasi village in the forest region of Southern Rajasthan, is caught between the bureaucratic regime of the Forestry Department (FD) of India and progressive legislation that claims to restore the traditional rights of commoners. While the state has its own ideas about how villagers should manage their forest commons and their lives, the women of this adivasi community have stepped forward as the knowledge keepers, managers of the forests and champions of democratic representation to protect the right to common.

An AWEsome Energy Source: Where Do We Stand With Airborne Wind Energy?
 by Ugo Bardi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/10/an-awesome-energy-source-where-do-we-stand-with-airborne-wind-energy/

I have been following the development of airborne wind energy (AWE) for more than 10 years and I keep following it. This summer, I visited the campus of the Technical University of Delft, in Holland, where I met the people of ""Enevate"", the university spinoff dedicated to kite power, a field in which the university of Delft has been active for a long time. I found a dedicated group of young people, enthusiastic and competent, working hard at developing the concept. Recently, they scored a remarkable success obtaining the support of the EU Horizon program for the project ""REACH"" dedicated to airborne wind energy.

The Women's Boat To Gaza Activists Are Free And Undeterred

The women of the flotilla have confirmed their physical safety throughout, and the last of the 13 activists were released Friday. Yet even as they depart, the women of the flotilla have reiterated their reason for sailing: to raise awareness of the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where 80 percent of the 1.9 million residents rely on aid to survive. The 10-year blockade has crippled the economy, reducing trade to 15 percent of its pre-siege levels, while power outages, food shortages, rampant unemployment and undrinkable water perpetuate a state of crisis.

The 1945 Dresden Raid was surely one of the most destructive air-raids during the WWII but in the world history of massive military destructions and the war crimes against humanity too.[1] The main and most destructive air-raid was during the night of February 13th−14th, by the British Bomber Command when 805 bomber military crafts attacked the city of Dresden which up to that time was protected from similar attacks primarily for two reasons

Finally the humanitarian morality of USA has woken up after the Saudi Arabian air strike on a funeral procession gathering in Yemen took place.

Seeds Of Occuption: India's Stockholm Syndrome
 by Colin Todhunter 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/10/seeds-of-occuption-indias-stockholm-syndrome/

Occupation can take many forms. It does not necessarily imply a military presence or military domination. For example, in India right now, there is a drive to get genetically modified (GM) mustard sanctioned for commercial cultivation; this would be the first GM food crop to be grown in the country. Unfortunately, this push for GM is based on a flawed premise and an agenda steeped in fraud and unremitting regulatory delinquency, and any green light to go ahead would open the floodgates for more unnecessary and damaging GM food crops.

81307324765_10154615524559766,"Dear Friend,

Haiti is one of the disastrous stories of the modern world. Devastated by environmental degradation and imperialist manouerings  it is on the brink of becoming a failed state, or is it already a failed state? Then the 2010 earthquake struck. Around 200,000 people killed, most of infrastructure damaged, millions were affected. Before the country managed to climb out of that devastation Hurricane Matthew struck. At least 800 people dead and according to Haiti's internal minister the death toll could climb.  The vultures of disaster capitalism and international aid agencies are salivating. The international community has to come together quickly to help Haiti to get out of this hell hole. 

Yes, Hurricane Matthew is a consequence of changing climate system of the planet. The Haiti story clearly points out that the worst sufferers of climate change will be world's poor people. Saral Sarkar delves into this question in his article ""Saving The Planet, American Style — A Critical Review, And Some Thoughts And Ideas"". Bill McKibben, founder 350.org has declared a war on climate! Saral Sarkar warns that the war metaphor is highly complicated. He says that we have to say good bye to the lunatic idea that 'in a finite world infinite growth is possible'. He succintly puts it this way, ""And if we cannot but use the war metaphor, then it is we who are the aggressors, we are the enemy of nature. Then the first task on the path of this transition is to end our aggression. We then need only to withdraw and not carry on the aggression with other weapons.  We then don't need to build much, but we do need to dismantle a lot. Above all, particularly Americans and their fans and imitators in the rest of the world need to dismantle their American way of living.""

Well,  stories of cooperation in protecting the environment is the need of the hour. These stories will keep us from falling into the deepest gloom of despair. We have to keep hope alive. That's why CC always takes particular interest in bringing success stories of love, compassion, solidarity, sharing, cooperation..... Today we've a story from Ethiopia where Menz-Guassa Community of sub-saharan Africa successfully manage a communally protected  11,100-hectare region which has endangered Ethiopian wolf, gelada and Abyssinian hare as its inhabitants. And it is a 400 year old success story. 

Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the Afghanistan invasion. Apart from the death and destruction there is another side to this story. The herion epidemic! In 2001 poppy fields in Afghanistan was only 7,600 hectares , now it is 224,000 hectares. Heroin deaths shot up from 1,779 in 2001 to 10,574 in 2014 in USA only. 

 Israel has seized a Gaza-bound ship Zaytouna-Oliva in international waters and kidnapped, robbed and imprisoned 13 humane, anti-racist  women including the Australian captain, Madeleine Habib (from my hometown Hobart, Tasmania),  Northern Ireland Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Maguire and New Zealand Greens  MP Marama Davidson. Apartheid Israel has repeatedly kidnapped Australian women in international waters but in this instance except for the Australian Greens the response from  Australian MPs has been deafening silence. Dr. Gideon Polya writes an open letter to the Australian MPs on their inaction. 

And also more stories from around the world.

Haiti Death Toll Soars

At least 800 people in Haiti were killed by Hurricane Matthew, according to new figuresreleased Friday as remote regions cut off by the storm were able to resume outside contact. Annick Joseph, Haiti's internal minister, cautioned during a press conference, ""This is a very, very partial assessment of the damage and death,"" noting that yet more bodies were being discovered in remote mountain regions.

Some Americans – not government officials, not corporate big-wigs, but civil society activists – have now come forward to save the earth and, along with it, the world. It is only this nation, they seem to assume, that can really do something to take up the task – thanks to its enormous military and economic power. One of the plans, entitled A World at War, comes from Bill McKibben, founder of the group 350.org

 The Resilience Of An Indigenous Ethiopian Commons
 by Zelealem Tefera Ashenafi

Ethiopia is home to one of the oldest, most effective conservation management systems in sub-Saharan Africa, the Menz-Guassa Community Conservation Area, an 11,100-hectare region that is home to a rich endowment of grasslands, plants and rare animals such as the Ethiopian wolf, gelada and Abyssinian hare. The history of the indigenous land tenure system known as Atsme Irist  reveals a great deal about how people in Menz have been able to regularly use, but also preserve, valuable grazing lands and ecosystem services for more than 400 years.

Suing Saudi Arabia For 9/11: Another American Obsession
by Taj Hashmi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/08/suing-saudi-arabia-for-911-another-american-obsession/

Had Saudis been really somehow responsible for 9/11, the US Administration could have mobilized mass support for a regime-change operation in the Kingdom, instead of invading the wrong country to topple the wrong regime, Iraq and Saddam Hussein. We have no reasons to believe the bulk of people anywhere in the world – including Muslims – would have objected to the overthrow of a regime involved in orchestrating 9/11. In view of this controversial legislation, one may raise the questions: a) Why did the US Congress wait 15 years to punish Saudi Arabia for its ""role"" in the 9/11 attacks? b) Why instead of waging a retaliatory war against the Saudi regime (as a corollary to the ""War on Terror""), the US Administration has decided to slap on its wrist with this silly piece of legislation, which is again a violation of international law?

Two Parties, One Machine

How can citizens fight this utterly horrid momentum? Not with traditional media outlets. ""The revolution will not be televised!"" How should we vote in November? Should we follow Noam Chomsky's recommendation to ""hold your nose and vote for Clinton"" in contested states? It's hard to believe a person of his age and wisdom could utter such a thing. Haven't we all been holding our noses every four years, for as long as we can remember? Surely he remembers more of the disastrous consequences, and in finer detail, the results and repercussions than nearly all of us!

Anarchist Communism: The Most Moral Organization Of Society?

In this article I have attempted to depict the dual nature and the seeming contradictions of Peter Kropotkin's life and work. On the one hand, he was a pistol carrying activist who regarded violence as an indispensible tool in the arsenal of a revolutionary; on the other hand, those who knew him envied his peaceful nature and generosity, but more importantly, he penned the scientific work which emphasized cooperation and sympathy, rather than aggression and competition, as the leading factors of evolution.

It is employed quite often for creating religious divide. This helps them serve their communal agenda.

Today is the 15th anniversary of Afghanistan invasion. Kansas artist Priti Gulati Cox shares with us an ongoing art project on the invasion, deaths and destruction in its aftermath. 

Franklin Lamb who is a Faculty of Law, at Aleppo University  and a witness of the horrific siege of Aleppo writes about the violation of international laws by both parties of war. He puts the onus on each one of us to take action to alleviate the suffering of the besieged population of Aleppo who suffer from hunger, water and fuel shortage, deaths and destruction from continuous bombardment from both parties of the conflict. 

James Hansen a pioneering climate scientist and a whistle blower says that the Paris Cliamte agreement won't solve anything. He writes ""Global temperatures are already at the level of the Eemian period (130,000 to 115,000 years ago), when sea level was 6-9 meters higher than today. Considering the additional warming ""in the pipeline,"" due to delayed response of the climate system and the impossibility of instant replacement of fossil fuels, additional temperature rise is inevitable.""

IMF warns that eight years after the eruption of the global financial crisis, the conditions are being created for another meltdown of even bigger proportions. Some may ask, what's the big deal? Debt is the lifeline of capitalism, isn't it? The problem is that the system is so rotten that only so much debt can be absorbed by the system, beyond which the whole edifice will collapse. Current debt levels are 225 percent of global GDP! How long will this cassino run? Will it come down like a house of cards?

The Role Of Memory And Identity In The Obştea Forest Commons Of Romania
 by Monica Vasile

In the Vrancea Mountains of Romania, the Eastern Carpathians, people in dozens of villages have used community-based institutions known as obştea to manage forest commons since the sixteenth century. The original sense of the word, coming from Slavonic, is ""togetherness,"" and it underlines the participatory essence of the institution. The traditions of obştea are so deeply rooted among Vrâncean villagers that the forest is not regarded simply as a resource; it is a powerful source of collective identity, social practice and pride that has near-mythological resonances.

The Fallacy Of Economic Growth
by Yavor Tarinski 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/06/the-fallacy-of-economic-growth/

The Failure Of Land Privitization: On The Need For New Development Policies
by Dirk Lohr 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/10/06/the-failure-of-land-privitization-on-the-need-for-new-development-policies/

As soon as we start speaking about ""globalization,"" we inevitably associate it with the excessive financial markets that are disconnected from the real economy. There is less public awareness of another type of globalization that also involves the forced unification of institutions all over the world: the institution of private property and privatization strategies. The driving forces behind this development are – besides the usual suspects, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization – governmental development organizations themselves

How good are the endless debates on women enpowerment,…70% of indian women face torture in some form as a daily routine ! Is this the legacy we leave for our daughters …have we sealed their destinies by conditioning them to remain silent , agonised …living a life under constant threat ,fear and humiliation , What comes to the mind is the story of Rani Padmini of Chittor committing the divine suicide ""jauhar "" , maybe this is what lies in store for the future of women in india where rape and dowry deaths are now generalised immaterial normal everyday occurances !

Where Art Thou To, My Bharat

Much against the propoganda let loose in the media, including social one, my research shows that – since independence, we have had approximately 1050 retaliatory surgical strikes across border/LOC, but had let them remain in anonymity of unpublicized encounters at battalion levels, except the latest one, over killed by a publicity hungry dispensation, no doubt for their own narrow short term political gains.

Notwithstanding the widespread national and international condemnation there seems to be no let up in violence by Cow vigilantes.

Congress Overrides Obama Veto Of Bill Allowing 9/11 Lawsuits
by Tom Carter 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/30/congress-overrides-obama-veto-of-bill-allowing-911-lawsuits/

On Wednesday, the US Congress overturned President Obama's veto of legislation that would permit victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks and their families to sue Saudi Arabia. Declassified documents released this year confirm the involvement of Saudi intelligence agents in the funding, organization, and planning of the attacks—facts which were covered up for years by the Bush and Obama administrations.

It was momentous on one fundamental level. Here was the President of the United States, Barack Obama, holding the torch for a wretched ally the politicians on the Hill and others have had reservations over for many years.  Saudi Arabia, ever the thorn and asset of US interests, facing the grief of families who lost members on September 11, 2001.  This, the same ally whose theocratic bent remains the most bruising of obstacles in any claims that the US is open to a global democratic experiment.
 

Shimon Peres From The Perspective Of His Victims
 by Ilan Pappe

Shimon Peres  occupied many positions in politics that had immense impact on the Palestinians wherever they are. He was director general of the Israeli defense ministry, minister of defense, minister for development of the Galilee and the Negev (Naqab), prime minister and president. In all these roles, the decisions he took and the policies he pursued contributed to the destruction of the Palestinian people and did nothing to advance the cause of peace and reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis.

 by Prue Taylor

The ""common heritage of mankind"" is an ethical concept and a general concept of international law. It establishes that some localities belong to all humanity and that their resources are available for everyone's use and benefit, taking into account future generations and the needs of developing countries. It is intended to achieve aspects of the sustainable development of common spaces and their resources, but may apply beyond this traditional scope.

What It's Like To Be A Muslim Australian
by Ghali Hassan

A recent Essential Research poll had found 49 per cent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, including 60 per cent of Liberal-National Coalition voters, 40 per cent of Labor voters and 34 per cent of Greens voters agreed with the proposition that Muslim Australians were not integrating (assimilating) into ""Australian culture"" and pose a threat to Australia. It is the result of a steady diet of fear, and xenophobia fed to Australians by openly racist politicians and the mass media.

A Simple Solution For Kashmir
by Akhter Bhat 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/30/a-simple-solution-for-kashmir/

So, don't you think it has become imperative for India as well to look for an immediate solution for Kashmir? Then what is India waiting for? Why not start the process of solution finding now?  For Kashmiris , I think the best thing to do at the moment would be to stop fighting the forces with stones. Kashmir has lost enough of Rasheeds and Tawseefs and can't afford losing more. Kashmir has got enough of Inshas blinded and simply can't afford more.  They should immediately stop banging their heads into the walls so that no more heads are crushed. However, it is for the leaders of Kashmir, both from mainstream and separatist league to unite and press India for an ever lasting solution for Kashmir.

Green Governance: Ecological Survival, Human Rights And The Commons
by David Bollier

It might be claimed that green governance is a utopian enterprise. But the reality is that it is the neoliberal project of ever-expanding consumption on a global scale that is the utopian, totalistic dream. It manifestly cannot fulfill its mytho­logical vision of human progress through ubiquitous market activity. It simply demands more than Nature can deliver, and it inflicts too much social inequity and disruption in the process. The first step toward sanity requires that we recognize our myriad ecological crises as symptoms of an unsustainable cultural, socio­economic and political worldview

For him Muslims were not like any other citizens of India but a problem and to put across his message with more clarity he quoted a senior ideologue of the RSS, Deendayal Upadhyaya (1916-1968)

 by Naveed Qazi

Kashmir has seen a proliferation of conflict, yet responsible leadership is not yet understood by many of the leaders representing us. Rather, the so called 'electoral leaders' are trying to project Kashmir, through their manufactured representative democracy, from a 'conflict state' to a 'post conflict state.' The rationality given towards this exercise is the relevance of economic prosperity replacing the genuine political aspirations of the Kashmiri people.

Michel Bauwens &  Franco Iacomella argues in the affirmative. They put forward a vision of ""peer to peer"" and commons-oriented vision for a new type of civilization and economic system. No, it's not just imagination. It's already happening around the world. Countercurrents.org continues to report about it too. Yes, we can make change, and we are doing it. But the important question is how we gather into a critical mass that can make global societal change? http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/28/peer-to-peer-economy-and-new-civilization-centered-around-the-sustenance-of-the-commons/

34,000 people are forced to flee their homes each day due to conflict and persecution, many of them continuing to die in an attempt to reach safety?

It's upto us civil society to push forward for justice based resolution of the crisis. Our responsibilities are increasing.

 Peer-To-Peer Economy And New Civilization Centered Around The Sustenance Of The Commons
Co-Written by Michel Bauwens &  Franco Iacomella

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/28/peer-to-peer-economy-and-new-civilization-centered-around-the-sustenance-of-the-commons/

The ""peer to peer"" and commons-oriented vision for a new type of civilization and economic system starts from an analysis of what is fundamentally wrong with the current economic system. Rather than put forward a utopian ideal, the P2P vision is based on generalizing the already emerging forms of peer production, peer governance, and peer property

Standing In Solidarity For A Humanity Without Borders
by Adam Parsons 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/28/standing-in-solidarity-for-a-humanity-without-borders/

 34,000 people are forced to flee their homes each day due to conflict and persecution, many of them continuing to die in an attempt to reach safety? The shocking trends show no sign of abating, largely driven by violent conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa that Western powers have had a substantial role in causing or exacerbating. United Nations Summit on Refugees and Migrants convened  last week failed to deliver any concrete guarantees to solve the refugee crisis. Addressing the root causes of an economic order that constantly produces the drivers of mass human displacement—entrenched poverty, endless wars and worsening climate change—will demand a level of global economic sharing that is unlike anything we have seen since the foundation of the United Nations, before we can realistically envisage a better world without borders, xenophobia or racis

It really doesn't matter that these two creatures loathed and feared in varying degrees should even be conducting a debate.  What, after all, is there to dispute?  Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump inhabit worlds of the disparately dislikeable, and reaped the bounty of the US with varying degrees of ruthlessness.

by Jeffrey Rudolph 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/28/dennis-ross-propagandist/

Dennis Ross was the director of policy planning in the State Department under President George H. W. Bush, was a leading Middle East peace envoy under President Bill Clinton, served as a special advisor to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and served two years as a special assistant to President Barack Obama. As Ross has been deeply involved in shaping US policy toward the Middle East for over 25 years, and may again play an important role in a future administration, his geopolitical views are worth examining.

Trump And 9/11
by Linh Dinh 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/28/trump-and-911/

On 9/11/2001, Donald Trump did a live phone interview with New York's WWOR. Digging this up 15 years later, Politico and Mother Jones pointed out how Trump bragged about the new status of his 71-story Trump Tower, ""40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest—and then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest. And now it's the tallest."" It was a small dig at Trump's huge vanity. A much more interesting bit from the interview was passed over, however. TruthMakesPeace finally broadcast it on 9/16/16.

When Jesus and the Buddha met

The first presidential debate took place in Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. Predictably it was a damp squib. Patrick Martin calls it a  spectacle that revealed all the faultlines of American political system.

Another tragedy is emerging in Somalia. The UN just announced that due to drought and famine over 300,000 Somali children are suffering from severe malnutrition. Over 100 children are already dying everyday from starvation,  bringing back memories of the most recent Great Horn of Africa drought in 2011-12 when the UN admitted that 250,000, almost entirely children, died from starvation.

The first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was a political and cultural abomination.

El Buen Vivir And The Commons
Silke Helfrich interviews Gustavo Soto Santiesteban 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/27/el-buen-vivir-and-the-commons/

Buen Vivir is a proposal aimed at making visible and expressible aspects of reality that are ignored by the dominant paradigm. It is a proposal from a radical and spiritual perspective of ecology, and is logically incompatible with development and industrialization. It speaks of the possibility of living in common, for which the very concept ""development"" is not only insufficient but mistaken.

Bill's legacy is that hundreds of thousands of past students have created a world-wide network to take his concept forward.

Re-electing Jeremy Corbyn: The Triumph Of Momentum
 by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/27/re-electing-jeremy-corbyn-the-triumph-of-momentum/

The initial strategy from Labour MPs was to oust their leader in July on procedural grounds.  The mutineers (call them the Tories in Labour clothing, the Blairites) failed to get their wishes of disqualifying Corbyn from office by a narrow 18-14 ruling by the National Executive Committee that Corbyn be allowed on the ballot even without the endorsement of 20 percent of his MPs. Instead of limping away in defeat from contender Owen Smith, Corbyn strengthened his position to be, interestingly enough, Labour's strongest leader on paper to have ever been elected.

When Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers chose to remain seated during the national anthem on August 26 prior to the start of the team's game against the Green Bay Packers, as the rest of the stadium stood, he was not the only one engaging in a political act. But Kaepernick was likely the only one doing so consciously. And though he was outnumbered by tens of thousands in the stadium, and millions who watched on their television sets, Kaepernick's bold statement was infinitely more powerful and outsized in its impact.

The three member disciplinary board at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas claimed that the punishment for Manning, which involves a fourteen day sentence with seven suspended days, was occasioned by an attempt to take her own life in July.  A good deal of this gloomy effort was spurred on by official refusals to permit access to treatment for gender dysphoria.  Manning has not merely been an aberration to US state security in her actions, but a transgender puzzle within the military establishment.

The 2016 US Presidential Election Will Not Take Place

The 2016 election will be a non-event. The way the votes are counted will shape the destiny of the world, but the voting itself will be an empty ritual. That is not a reason not to vote, it is actually a reason to reject the idea that your vote was wasted. The votes are not wasted, but even if they are counted they are stolen. Stolen by fictional candidates like Trump and Clinton and stolen by the death of politics. Vote your conscience and then live according to it. Let everyone know that your vote was stolen by a system that is fraudulent. Make sure that everyone remembers that it is a lie every time they tell you that you might not like what the President does but you have to accept it because that is the way democracy works

 We've bad news on the climate change front. Three reports released recently point to grave danger to our planet and lives on earth. Speaking at a University of Oxford conference this week, led by leading U.K. climate researcher Richard Betts, scientists said global greenhouse gas emissions are not likely to slow down quickly enough to avoid passing the 1.5°C target. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/24/earth-could-reach-critical-climate-threshold-in-decade-scientists-warn/

A new study published in the journal Science found that the Earth is soaking up carbon at a far slower rate than previously estimated—which could mean a massive setback for environmental efforts.

Washington based think tank and advocacy group Oil Change International in association with 14 other climate change groups have come out with  report which finds that in order to reach the Paris goals- 'for the 2°C or 1.5°C limits,  68% or 85% of fossil fuel reserves respectively must remain in the ground.' 

A subzero winter is coming to Standing Rock but the protesters are resolute in their perseverence. 

Bill McKibben points out that the resistance at Standing Rock should be at two fronts, ""Against Big Oil And Big Banks."" He writes ""virtually every name in the financial pantheon has extended credit in some form to the Dakota pipeline project, according to a remarkable dossier assembled by the organization Food and Water Watch. It shows a credit line of $10.25 billion (that's a b) for the companies directly involved in building the project—from 38 banks—a list of names that, the group adds, ""might give you flashbacks to the 2007 financial crisis.""""

There are lots of ways you can show your solidarity and support. Why not an economic boycott of these banks as Bill McKibben suggests?

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/24/paris-goals-likely-to-fail-if-fossil-fuel-production-is-not-controlled/

Washington based think tank and advocacy group Oil Change International in association with 14 other climate change groups have come out with a very relevant report which assesses the fossil fuel production and its likely impact on the climate change. The report finds that in order to reach the Paris goals- 'for the 2°C or 1.5°C limits, respectively 68% or 85% of fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground.'

 Many at the Standing Rock protest site have confidence that their strong sense of purpose and the knowledge that they are on the right side of history will help them persevere through the cold months ahead. But despite every preparation being made, they will be tested: Winter is coming.

Why Standing Rock Needs To Be A Two-Front War—Against Big Oil And Big Banks

In fact, virtually every name in the financial pantheon has extended credit in some form to the Dakota pipeline project, according to a remarkable dossier assembled by the organization Food and Water Watch. It shows a credit line of $10.25 billion (that's a b) for the companies directly involved in building the project—from 38 banks—a list of names that, the group adds, ""might give you flashbacks to the 2007 financial crisis.""

How You Can Support Standing Rock

I invite you to remember that this is just a moment in a struggle that has been going on for centuries—and will continue for many more. We are allies, but it's our battle too. There are as many ways to engage as there are people who drink water. Whatever you have to offer, we need it. Wherever you're at, take one step deeper. Find your voice. Find your own front lines.

The United States has been at war for 15 years — wars intensified by a Nobel Peace Laureate. The cost is now estimated by reliable sources in the trillions and worldwide casualties in the millions. Post-traumatic stress disorder has reached epidemic proportions: an average of 22 US veterans are committing suicide … each day.

Building On The UN Summit To Address Large Movements Of Refugees And Migrants
by Rene Wadlow

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/24/building-on-the-un-summit-to-address-large-movements-of-refugees-and-migrants/

Citizens of the world have been actively concerned with the issues of migrants, refugees, the « stateless » and those displaced by armed conflcts within their own country. Thus we welcome the spirit of the UN General Assembly  Summit Declaration with its emphasis on cooperative action, a humane sense of sharing the responsibilities for refugees and migrants and on seeking root causes of migration and refugee flows. There are three issues mentioned in the Summit Declaration which merit follow up action among the UN Secretariat

America's mendacious, serial invader,  war criminal, climate criminal and human rights-violating  President Barack Obama made his last speech to the UN General Assembly on 20 September 2016, a speech characterized by massive lying by omission that is far , far worse than lying by commission because the latter can at least be  refuted and subject to public debate

Therefore, what has written and portraits did not communicate a deep meaning but they showed a pathway to understanding the agony, affliction and throes of our past generations.

Community Based Forest And Livelihood Management In Nepal
 by Shrikrishna Upadhyay 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/23/community-based-forest-and-livelihood-management-in-nepal/

The reintroduction of a multiparty system in Nepal in 1990 after the peaceful revolution against the autocratic Monarchial Panchayat regime1 provided political space for communities to get organized and manage common pool resources, including water and forest. The state established new policies and funding mechanisms to support the evolution of new types of grassroots-based, self-governing institutions. The energies released from this self-governance movement resulted in a powerful expansion of community forests in Nepal, which has directly benefited about 1.7 million households, or about 32 percent of the population, organized into 16,000 community forestry user groups (CFUGs) that manage 1.2 million hectares of land, or about one fourth of Nepal's forested areas.

The key concern that has emerged in the past few years, however, is an increasingly open attempt by the fossil fuel industry to co-opt the negotiation process at the annual UNFCCC COP.                 At the 2009 COP 15, in Copenhagen, the fossil fuel industry played a significant role by lobbying against tough emissions cuts. Unsurprisingly, the negotiations failed. The role of the business community was even more prominent at the 2013 COP 19 held at Warsaw, Poland, where representatives of global businesses officially took part as observers and sponsors.

Does #BlackLivesMatter? The disturbing developments from Charlotte, North Carolina seems it doesnt! Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by a police man and for the last two days Charlotte is burning. Another black man is shot and critically injured. The Mayor has put the city under Emergency. Black activists have reacted by threatening an economic boycott if Black Lives are not respected. How many black lives need to be lost before the racist law enforcement agencies wake up to understand that Black Lives too need dignity and respect?

In the meantime, Kashmir remains shut for 76th consecutive day. Over 80 persons dead. Why isn't there a hashtag #KashmirLivesMatter? Or like the case of blacks Kashmir lives too don't matter? 

The Nuclear South Asian region is sitting on a tinter box, after the Uri military camp attack allegedly by Pakistan trained militants. Suparna Banerjee begs restraint from media in both India and Pakistan and warns against fanning jingoistic sentiments. Politicians and too are flexing muscles. This is time for utmost restraint, otherwise, things could go out of hand. 

China and Russia conducted joint naval exercises in the South China Sea last week. Dr Arshad M Khan argues that this could be the end of the single super power world. Well, that could be the case, and it may also put restraint on American and NATO imperialism, but it is not going to make the world a better place. 

Sarah van Gelder travels to Standing Rock encampment and finds a community standing together putting all rivalries apart for a common purpose. She writes ""Life at the water protectors' encampment is much like life was for millions of years of human evolution—close to the earth, near a river, clustered in family and community camps. There's a rightness to these connections and to the feeling that people here will help you when you need it. Here, with a purpose that threads through generations, work, celebration, and activism are a seamless whole. Young people ride through the camp on horseback among tents and teepees. Are they providing security, learning traditional animal caretaking, or just having fun together? Elders tell stories of Wounded Knee, say prayers, and sing. Are they educating the next generation, building coherence, or guiding the actions? These things are not separate. They are all of a piece, all about rebuilding indigenous ways of life and standing against further destruction.""

There is a movement growing in strength as a rallying point against all the crises humanity is facing. It's the Food Movement. Food Philosophy is gaining currency. This is a movement that can challenge the whole system considering these two simple facts 1. 40 % of all food produced in USA is wasted and it is one third for the whole world! 2. If we can conserve and distribute this wasted food no one will go to bed hungry in the world! Human beings produce enough food waste to feed 3 billion people! Don't you think that it's time to get into action mode? http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/22/why-the-food-movement-is-unstoppable/

Now is not the time for the media to join the bandwagon and supply knee-jerk reactions to flare up opinion on such vital matters.

Why The Food Movement Is Unstoppable
by Jonathan Latham 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/22/why-the-food-movement-is-unstoppable/

The growth of the food movement is the people's response to the failing ideas of the enlightenment. It represents a tectonic realignment of the forces underlying our society and a clash of ideas more profound than anything seen since the collapse of feudalism and the emergence of the industrial revolution. The outcome of this clash will determine not only the future of our society, but also whether our descendents get to live on a planet recognisable to us today. The portents are excellent. The food movement is prevailing because it takes advantage of the synergies and potentials inherent in biological systems, whereas the ideas of the enlightenment ignore, deny, and suppress these potentialities. It will indeed be a beautiful struggle to turn these portents into reality.

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/22/an-incomplete-american-presidency/

Some around the world were saying that the situation had deteriorated to the point where the US was turning into a ""rogue state."" Pronouncements by populist Donald Trump casting American inner cities as ""war zones"" seemed to reconfirm this. Many in America were leaning toward that same conclusion

USAID or US CIA?
 by Thomas C Mountain 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/22/usaid-or-us-cia/

Earlier this year Ms. Smith sent 25 senior CIA investigators to Ethiopia to see first hand what was going on with the nationwide uprising under cover of ""investigating the drought"". Their report, yet to be made public, must have been pretty dire for not to long later, Freedom House, that excreable voice of the CIA, published a report insinuating that replacements for the present Ethiopian regime could be in the works

Delhi Workers In The Grip Of Fever And The Deplorable Condition Of Healthcare System

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/22/delhi-workers-in-the-grip-of-fever-and-the-deplorable-condition-of-healthcare-system/

Since the past one month, entire Delhi is in the grip of fever. Diseases like Dengue used to break out every monsoon, but this year, Chikungunya and Malaria have been added to the list. While no section of the city is left untouched, the worst affected are the poor and the working classes. At this time, we will hardly find any person in the slums of Delhi who isn't affected by fever, joint pain. But this aspect caught the attention of the media only when a large number of workers started missing work because of illness and this disrupted construction work and production in the factories.

Disturbing Developments In Assam

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/22/disturbing-developments-in-assam/

After the BJP came to power in Assam in May 2016, the state government has unleashed a reign of terror to execute its fascistic agendas. Within 2 months into power, the government opened fire and killed a 25 year old man Mintu Deuri, during a protest organized in Raha against the transfer of the site for a proposed AIIMS in the state on 15th July 2016. Now on 19 September 2016, just 34 days after the Raha incident, the police has again opened fire and killed two people – Anjuma Khatun and Fakhruddin, at a demonstration led by the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) and All Assam Minority Students' Union (AAMSU) at Banderdubi revenue village near the Kaziranga National Park",Why The Food Movement Is Unstoppable,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/22/why-the-food-movement-is-unstoppable/,2016-09-22 09:42:58,7,1,5,7,0,0,0,0,0
81307324765_10154565309679766,"Dear Friend,

Richard Heinberg of Post Carbon Institute is worried. So many people who understand the Limit to Growth has started openly speaking of inevitable collapse. He says, it's not  time to panic but for action. He says quoting from paper he co-wrote with  energy expert David Fridley ""it may be possible to build enough solar and wind supply capacity to substitute for current fossil energy sources, much of current energy usage infrastructure (for transportation, agriculture, and industrial processes) will be difficult and expensive to adapt to using renewable electricity. In the face of these and other related challenges, we suggest that it likely won't be possible to maintain a consumption-oriented growth economy in the post-fossil future, and that we would all be better off aiming to transition to a simpler and more localized conserver economy."" He warns against PR-savvy environmentalists who promise endless ""green growth"".

Ugo Bardi of  University of Firenze, Italy has another suggestion, ""Creative Collapsing"".  He takes a leaf from the sower's wisdom and makes a quantitative calculation of how much energy we must squeeze out of the remaining fossil fuels reserves in order to build up the renewable energy infrastructure that will smoothly replace the present, fossil based, infrastructure. And how to do that without going over the climate edge. If we can manage that, it will be only the fossil fuel industry that collapses, but not the rest of us. And the calculations show that it is possible.

Climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf  quotes newly elected Australian Senator Malcolm Roberts from his maiden speech: ""It is basic. The sun warms the earth's surface. The surface, by contact, warms the moving, circulating atmosphere. That means the atmosphere cools the surface. How then can the atmosphere warm it? It cannot. That is why their computer models are wrong."" Stefan Rahmstorf says it's a neagation of second law of thermodynamics. Remember this whenever a climate denier confronts you, you can't change the laws of nature!

One and only Gail Tverberg analyses the historic data and finds out that falling productivity is related to lower fossil fuel availability. Well, a good news on the face of it. But it can, and it is driving down the economy causing job losses and perhaps creating another economic collapse. This calls for using whatever fossil fuel left in the ground to be used for a greener energy transition, like Richard Heinberg says towards a low energy ""simpler and more localized conserver economy"". This is an urgent task on our hand. Ignoring it can lead to the dreaded economic collapse. 

Third and last part of David Bollier's important article ""Transnational Republics of Commoning: Reinventing Governance through Emergent Networks"" . In today's article he re-imagines the polity for a networked humanity. But he warns, ""the commons is no magic talisman, nor a panacea.  Nor are network platforms.  But they do enable us to rediscover that sovereignty does not ultimately reside in the state or market (especially in these times), but within ourselves, together."" http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/21/re-imagining-the-polity-for-a-networked-humanity/

Irwin Jerome and Chip Ward see the Sioux uprising at Standing Rock as a historic moment heralding a movement to protect life on earth and saving what's left of our common heritage. 

As Kashmir remains shut for 75th consecutive day, Dr Chandra Muzaffar of JUST Internations says that ""We The People"" must stand up and speak for peace and justice in Kashmir. 

Everybody knows Malala Yousufzai, but who knows Insha Malik asks Mir Liyaqat Nazir. Insha Malik is the girl who lost both her eyes in pellet gun fire in Kashmir. He asks why there is no world outrage on the suffering of Insha Malik. 

Aylan Kurdi is another victim of war who shook the world conscience. Dr. Ramzy Baroud says even Aylan Kurdi's  image is disturbingly used by various parties to validate their reasons for war. Stop the war in Syria! That's the only way, we can do justice to the memory of Aylan Kurdi.

Re-Imagining The Polity For A Networked Humanity
 by David Bollier 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/21/re-imagining-the-polity-for-a-networked-humanity/

Exploring The Gap Between Business-As-Usual And Utter Doom
 by Richard Heinberg 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/21/exploring-the-gap-between-business-as-usual-and-utter-doom/

We concluded that, while in theory it may be possible to build enough solar and wind supply capacity to substitute for current fossil energy sources, much of current energy usage infrastructure (for transportation, agriculture, and industrial processes) will be difficult and expensive to adapt to using renewable electricity. In the face of these and other related challenges, we suggest that it likely won't be possible to maintain a consumption-oriented growth economy in the post-fossil future, and that we would all be better off aiming to transition to a simpler and more localized conserver economy.

Creative Collapsing: A Way To Avoid The Climate Disaster
 by Ugo Bardi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/21/creative-collapsing-a-way-to-avoid-the-climate-disaster/

Is it possible to collapse gracefully and glide down in style along the Seneca cliff? In principle, yes. The recent paper by Sgouridis, Csala and Bardi , titled ""The Sower's Way."" takes inspiration from a strategy well known to ancient farmers, the fact that they had to save something from their current harvest for the next one; it is the origin of the common saying ""don't eat your seed corn!"" So, the paper reports a quantitative calculation of how much energy we must squeeze out of the remaining fossil fuels reserves in order to build up the renewable energy infrastructure that will smoothly replace the present, fossil based, infrastructure. And how to do that without going over the climate edge. If we can manage that, it will be only the fossil fuel industry that collapses, but not the rest of us. And the calculations show that it is possible

What Really Causes Falling Productivity Growth:An Energy-Based Explanation
 by Gail Tverberg 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/21/what-really-causes-falling-productivity-growthan-energy-based-explanation/

What really causes falling productivity growth? The answer seems to be very much energy-related. Human labor by itself does not cause productivity growth. It is human labor, leveraged by various tools, that leads to productivity growth. These tools are made using energy, and they often use energy to operate. A decrease in energy consumption by the business sector can be expected to lead to falling productivity growth. In this post, I will explain why such a pattern can be expected, and show that, in fact, such a pattern is happening in the United States.

Can A Blanket Violate The Second Law Of Thermodynamics?
 by Stefan Rahmstorf 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/21/can-a-blanket-violate-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/

One of the silliest arguments of climate deniers goes like this: the atmosphere with its greenhouse gases cannot warm the Earth's surface, because it is colder than the surface. But heat always flows from warm to cold and never vice versa, as stated in the second law of thermodynamics. The freshly baked Australian Senator Malcolm Roberts has recently phrased it thus in his maiden speech: ""It is basic. The sun warms the earth's surface. The surface, by contact, warms the moving, circulating atmosphere. That means the atmosphere cools the surface. How then can the atmosphere warm it? It cannot. That is why their computer models are wrong.""

Edward Snowden, The CIA And Sioux Indian Converge In Man's Life
 by Irwin Jerome 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/21/edward-snowden-the-cia-and-sioux-indian-converge-in-mans-life/

The theme underlying the Snowden Story is the fundamental question of Allegiance. To whom must the citizenry ultimately devote their allegiance: to the blind, unquestioning support of the Nazi War Machine during WWII; the American government and its CIA, NSA & DIA's mass spying on its people, or; the Standing Rock Sioux Indian people and their supporters in the world allowing Wall Street and the Dakota Access Pipeline to forever desecrate the sacred waters and lands of all the people? Snowden Live and Sioux Indian defiance challenges every human being to answer for themselves the question, ""What country, philosophy, ideology or way of life do you subscribe to and to whom you are prepared to commit your life's total allegiance?""

Peace Pipes, Not Oil Pipes
 by Chip Ward 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/21/peace-pipes-not-oil-pipes/

An economy hooked on carbon is threatening life on Earth. The waters of seas and oceans are warming fast; the weather is becoming unpredictable and harsh.   Perhaps it's time to finally listen to and learn from people who lived here sustainably for thousands of years. Respecting Sioux sovereignty and protecting the sacred sites of tribes in their own co-managed national monument could write the next chapter in our American story, the one in which the Indians finally get to be heroes and heroines fighting to protect our way of life as well as their own

Despite the international despair generated by Aylan's photo, the image was disturbingly used by various parties to validate their reasons for war. In some way, the photograph had, itself, become a weapon in the hands of the warring parties, as opposed to a rallying cry for an urgent ceasefire and eventual peace.

Clinton Campaign In Crisis Over Plunging Support Among Younger Voters
  by Zaida Green 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/18/clinton-campaign-in-crisis-over-plunging-support-among-younger-voters/

The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is responding to poll numbers and other indications of declining support among younger voters by deploying its most prominent surrogates to college campuses. The moves come a day after two national surveys, one conducted by Quinnipiac University and the other by CBS News and the New York Times, found that more than a third of voters under the age of 30 plan to vote for third-party presidential candidates.

No greater hits in the Australian record of cruelty and mania come close than the approach of outsourcing refugee obligations and the conjectures of global terrorism.  The former stance assumes that refugees are disposable on arrival, repellent jumpers of a fictional human queue who can be shifted and trafficked to global outposts that have little bearing to the recipient country.

The Rise Of The Right And Climate Catastrophe

In a year of record-setting heat on a blistered globe, with fast-warmingoceans, fast-melting ice caps, and fast-rising sea levels, ratification of the December 2015 Paris climate summit agreement — already endorsed by most nations — should be a complete no-brainer.  That it isn't tells you a great deal about our world.  Global geopolitics and the possible rightward lurch of many countries (including a potential deal-breaking election in the United States that could put a climate denier in the White House) spell bad news for the fate of the Earth. It's worth exploring how this might come to be.

Transnational Republics Of Commoning
 by David Bollier 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/16/transnational-republics-of-commoning/

The nation-state as now constituted, in its close alliance with capital and markets, is largely incapable of transcending its core commitments to economic growth, consumerism, and the rights of capital and corporations — arguably the core structural drivers of climate change. But these allegiances artificially limit our options, if not dismiss the kinds of interventions we must entertain. The market/state simply command and coerce its way to success in arresting with climate change; it will require the active, enthusiastic contributions of everyone, and it must command social respect and political legitimacy. A new vision and popular energy from the outside must arise.  But how?  And how could it possibly expand to a meaningful size rapidly enough?  I think that the Internet and other digital networks offer a fertile vector in which to develop new answers. I explore the speculative possibilities in this essay

The following 10 ideas for action are the result of 10 years of research at the P2P Foundation on the emerging practices of new productive communities and those ethical entrepreneurial coalitions that can create livelihoods on top of shared resources. Together, they emphasize the emerging practices that can bolster the resilience of a new ethical economy. Our goal is to encourage the creation of new entities that overstep the traditional corporate form and its extractive profit-maximizing practices. What we need, instead of extractive forms of capital, is generative ideas that co-create value with and for commoners.

Monsanto And Bayer: Why Food And Agriculture Just Took A Turn For The Worse
 by Colin Todhunter 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/15/monsanto-and-bayer-why-food-and-agriculture-just-took-a-turn-for-the-worse/

News broke this week that Monsanto accepted a $66 billion takeover bid from Bayer. The new company would control more than 25 per cent of the global supply of commercial seeds and pesticides. Bayer's crop chemicals business is the world's second largest after Syngenta, and Monsanto is the leading commercial seeds business.

Monsanto And The Poisonous Cartel Of GMOs In India
by Vandana Shiva 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/15/monsanto-and-the-poisonous-cartel-of-gmos-in-india/

India is steeped in a synthesized controversy created by Monsanto on the first GMO crop supposedly approved for commercialization. Engaged in litigation on many fronts, Monsanto is trying to subvert India's patent laws: Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers Right Act, Essential Commodities Act and Competition Act. It is behaving as if there is no Parliament, no democracy, no sovereign laws in India to which it is subject. Or it simply doesn't have any regard for them.

The Fourth Remake Of ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers""
 by Richard Oxman 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/15/the-fourth-remake-of-invasion-of-the-body-snatchers/

Today, though, we need a new version of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. One that""s germane for 2016. Specifically, one which spotlights our devaluation of life itself, our collective resignation vis-a-vis going over the precipice… without any help from alien life forms. One that shows how the disappearance of our humanity is a function of an internal invasion.

An Asteroid Called ""Peak Oil"" – The Real Cause Of The Growing Social Inequality In The US
 by Ugo Bardi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/15/an-asteroid-called-peak-oil-the-real-cause-of-the-growing-social-inequality-in-the-us/

In a recent article on the Huffington Post, Stan Sorscher reports the graph above and asks the question of what could have happened in the early 1970s that changed everything. Impressive, but what caused this ""something"" that happened in the early 1970s? According to Sorscher, X marks the spot. In this case, ""X"" is our choice of national values. We abandoned traditional American values that built a great and prosperous nation.   Unfortunately, this is a classic case of an explanation that doesn't explain anything. Why did the American people decide to abandon traditional American values just at that specific moment in time?

Right-To-Repair Activists Are Heroes
by Kevin Carson 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/15/right-to-repair-activists-are-heroes/

The only function of ""intellectual property"" is to snatch scarcity from the jaws of abundance — to take goods that, thanks to the advance of human knowledge, should naturally be getting cheaper, and make them artificially expensive. This is nowhere more evident than in the war corporations are fighting against their own customers' right to repair the items they purchase. Fortunately, as Emily Matchar points out at Smithsonian (""The Fight for the 'Right to Repair,'"" July 13), there are activists fighting for the right to repair

 
Nature Is Being Renamed 'Natural Capital' – But Is It Really The Planet That Will Profit?

The four-yearly World Conservation Congress of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has just taken place in Hawai'i. The congress is the largest global meeting on nature's conservation.

Brahmanization Of The Onam Festival
 by Ambedkar-Periyar Study Circle

Portraying Onam as Vamana Jayanthi is just another step by Sangh Parivar forces to bring all festivals into the hindutva fold which is essential to project the idea of hindu rashtra, a homogeneous culture of Hindi-Hindu-Hindutva.

Prakash Karat's Critique Of BJP/RSS And Left Unity
by Vijay Prashad 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/15/prakash-karats-critique-of-bjprss-and-left-unity/

The BJP pushes its right-wing agenda, but it is hampered by a host of political adversaries – not only political parties, but also pressure groups and mass sentiment that will not allow it to enact its complete agenda. The fact that one hundred and eighty million workers went on strike shows that there remains wide opposition to the BJP's 'labour reform' agenda, one that is otherwise quite acceptable to large sections of the parliamentary opposition (including the Congress Party).",24 Countries Must Share Their  Surplus Farmland With 2 Billion Others,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/15/24-countries-must-share-their-surplus-farmland-with-2-billion-others/,2016-09-15 11:29:00,5,0,6,5,0,0,0,0,0

A Space Shared Is A Space Doubled
 by Sabine Lutz 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/13/a-space-shared-is-a-space-doubled/

 Streets and plazas are the spaces of the public, the spaces where people encounter each other. Such encounters can be fleeting or intense, but they always imply the possibility of lingering. Yet lingering is difficult if not impossible if our roads are designed to serve the needs of traffic practically to the exclusion of everything else. The concept of Shared Space was developed to contrast any singular use of a space with a more flexible concept of space open to diverse uses. The design of a street should not predetermine just one particular use, but be open and adaptable for many uses.

If an effective counter to the Sangh forces in the name of social justice has to be forged as of this political now (which can easily change), it has to start from where the Dalit Bahujan groups have drawn the line. If there is a call for a political unity between the Left and Dalit Bahujan groups, the latter are well within their rights to stay away given the constant denial of agency that they have suffered. Having said that, it is also important for them to engage with the Left if Brahminism has to be countered.","Eid, A Day Of Mourning For Kashmir As Two More Youth Killed: Death Toll 82",link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/13/eid-a-day-of-mourning-for-kashmir-as-two-more-youth-killed-death-toll-82/,2016-09-13 09:21:41,16,1,4,7,0,0,0,4,5

Living In ""The Garden Of Life""
 by Margrit Kennedy 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/12/living-in-the-garden-of-life/

Since 1985, an intentional community of about 100 adults and 40 children in the middle of Lower Saxony, Germany, has created the ""Lebensgarten Steyerberg"" out of a munitions factory housing project built in the late 1930s for World War II.1 The anchor of the community, which is spread out over 65 buildings, is a large community building that serves as a cultural and social center. One of the greatest miracles that we experienced here at Lebensgarten (in English, the Garden of Life), is the greater diversity of skills that people somehow find and develop when the kind of specialists available in major cities are not around. 

Can The Growing Number Of Government-Rebel Reconciliation Agreements End The Bloodshed In Syria?
 by Franklin Lamb 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/12/can-the-growing-number-of-government-rebel-reconciliation-agreements-end-the-bloodshed-in-syria/

One senses  among those leaving al-Moaddamiyeh this weekend a will to let things calms down, partly due to exhaustion and not being sure of a military solution despite widespread social media posturing notwithstanding.  This feeling at least until they see if a serious transitional process can put agreed and put in place, perhaps under UN auspices. This observer senses, after talking with army and rebel guys that local ceasefires may well be the most effective way of gradually bringing peace to a country where more approximately half a million people have been killed.

Just a few weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that he cares about the rights and lives of Palestinians in Gaza more than the Palestinian leadership does, he posted a new video message on his Facebook wall, arguing that any future dismantlement of Jewish settlements in the West Bank would amount to ""ethnic cleansing."" He went on to intimate that insofar as the U.S. and other western countries support the uprooting of Israeli settlements as part of an agreement with the Palestinians, they were, in effect, supporting the cleansing of Jews.

What did Dilma Rousseff do to warrant impeachment? According to her opponents, she falsified the accounts to exaggerate the health of the economy, a practice not uncommon among governors. In her case, a fiscal court rejected the 2014 accounting report, which under normal circumstances would have prompted a revision; instead the Senate plotters seized upon it to draw up impeachment papers.

The Empire Paradox: More Power Is More Weakness
by Kieran Kelly 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/12/the-empire-paradox-more-power-is-more-weakness/

In response to my recent article on US imperial wars some people objected to my characterisation of the US empire. I wrote: ""In global terms the US has never been more powerful"" and some were quick to point out that the US empire is very weak. To those people I want to say that we are both right, but the weaknesses of the US empire do not generally affect its functioning. One day these weakness will become very, very important, but we cannot predict when that will be. In the meantime, critics of US empire undermine themselves by their focus on weakness, which often leads to millenarian predictions of immanent collapse.

Once we recognize and nurture this, once we honor it, we can reboot democracy and get on with the work of liberating the country we carry in our hearts.

Fifteen Years After 9/11: Is America Any Safer?
by Taj Hashmi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/12/fifteen-years-after-911-is-america-any-safer/

""Is America Any Safer"" is the cover story of this September's Atlantic magazine. CNN and other media outlets are also commemorating the catastrophic terror attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001. Reflecting their collective delusions of persecution, and exaggerated self-importance, Americans in general are perplexed about certain things with regard to 9/11: a) what went wrong with their intelligence; b) why some people hate them so much; c) America is no longer invincible; and d) theirs being ""The land of the free and the home of the brave"" will always remain ""Number One"". However, the politics of fear- and hate-mongering has impaired American minds, which only think Islamist terrorists are the only security threat to their nation.

Our people need to read other nationalist movements happened in the world, where the newly designed States helped in creating a strong economic and political background in countries. To qualify to be a nationalist, one has to be receptive to failures of the present and retrospect from history, and to be a nationalist leader, one has to learn international strategies out of geo-political movements. As Kashmiri people, we need to discuss problems from both sides, and not just think about only one perspective – our local one. Our goals need to be international.

Wall Street's Destruction Of Sacred Sioux Indian Burial Grounds
 by Irwin Jerome 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/11/wall-streets-destruction-of-sacred-sioux-indian-burial-grounds/

Energy Transfer Partners and its coterie of Fat Cats recently sent in a fleet of Caterpillar tractors to intentionally destroy the culturally-sensitive, sacred burial grounds of the Standing Rock Sioux people before their legal representatives could address relevant state and federal protocols in a court of law, or North Dakota's State Historic Preservation Office could do a proper survey of the area. One could either call it a stroke of genius or stupidity, matched only, perhaps, by the diabolical craftiness of North Dakota Governor Dalrymple who sought to cut off all the cell phone and internet WiFi reception in the contested Sioux lands of North Dakota to try to muzzle any factual accounts from ever reaching the outside world.

Practicing Commons In Community Gardens: Urban Gardening As A Corrective For Homo Economicus
 by Christa Muller

The new gardening movement is young, colorful and socially heterogeneous. In Berlin, ""indigenous"" city dwellers work side-by-side with long-time Turkish residents to grow vegetables in neighborhood gardens and community gardens; pick-your-own gardens and farmers' gardens are forming networks with one another. The intercultural gardening movement is continuing to expand in striking ways, as seen on the online platform Mundraub.org, which uses Web 2.0 technology to tag the locations of fruit trees whose apples and other fruits can be picked for free

On Friday, September 9th, America's Secretary of State John Kerry, and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, came to an agreement on Syria, for the second time. (The previous agreement fell apart). Like the first 'cease-fire', this one concerns the ongoing occupation of many parts of Syria by foreign jihadists, who have been hired by America's allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in order to overthrow Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad.

Since the campaign to push and promote Narendra Modi as a prime ministerial candidate began, and was remorselessly funded by corporate houses from 2013 on, the current dominant Indian political regime's relationship with an autonomous media has been the subject matter of furious debate. Heavy corporate investment in the election campaign and the same corporate share in television network holdings have given a further twist to the debate. Now, in 2016, even a Canadian Radio network appears to have succumbed to pressures to stifle free expression

Acceptance of this responsibility sets the ground for our journey to a living Earth economy and a future in which all life can thrive.

Her health is deteriorating, and she has been hospitalized. There has still been no charge, only a newspaper article on June 24 claiming that Hoodfar was ""dabbling in feminism and security matters.""

 African Union: The West's Gendarme In Africa

The African Union is the west's gendarme in Africa with it's combined national armed forces increasingly primed to invade and occupy rather than keep the peace. The latest potential victim of the African Union, backed by its big brother, the UN, is South Sudan. Before that Burundi was threatened with invasion by the AU ""peacekeepers"".

Money has evolved over time; money is no longer a ""thing.""

Every national currency is supported by the collective credit of everyone who is obliged by law to accept it.

Syria: Potential Fuse For Greater Conflagration
by Eresh Omar Jamal 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/09/syria-potential-fuse-for-greater-conflagration/

 Syria is quickly turning into a powder-keg that can blow up any minute, leading to a much greater conflagration. Thus, it is best now for all sides to let cooler heads prevail rather than escalate the violence that has already led to millions of Syrians fleeing the war-torn country as refugees — contributing to the displacement of the highest number of people since the end of World War II — any further. The super-powers involved have a special responsibility in that regard, as it is the unimaginable suffering of the Syrian people, who have, perhaps, had the least say in all of this, that is the greatest tragedy humanity is facing by allowing the crisis to perpetuate for this long.

The Presidency: Character Matters
by William John Cox 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/09/the-presidency-character-matters/

Americans will have to live with their choices in the 2016 election, but if nothing else, the election clearly demonstrates that something must be done to transform the government of the United States into one that serves its People, rather than those who buy their representatives. This will require changes to the Constitution, and the only comprehensive proposal currently being circulated is the U.S. Voters' Rights Amendment (USVRA). Widespread public disgust with the 2016 election  may provide the motivation for its serious consideration.

Global Enclosures In The Service Of Empire
 by David Bollier 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/08/global-enclosures-in-the-service-of-empire/

To NATO decision makers, the ""global commons"" consists of those empty spaces and resources that lie beyond the direct and exclusive control of nation-states. In other words: NATO sees these spaces as no-man's land without governance. To NATO, the key ""global commons"" are outer space, the oceans and the Internet. The problems posed by these ""commons,"" conference organizers suggest, is that they must somehow be dominated by NATO countries lest hostile countries, rogue states and pirates interfere with US and European commercial and military activities. Hence the need for NATO's military supervision.

The image of the wretched man with the corpse of his wife flung over his shoulder meandering the streets uncared for, overlooked and disregarded by the world that passes this sight by mercilessly is one that is going to haunt a whole generation no doubt. Is he just another soldier battling the unjust elements in a lost world bereft of humanity?

Inner Transition : An Introduction
 by Stephen Hinton

Actually, in the resilient, balanced society, you create and carry a preparedness to deal with threats whilst setting up a society that offers security of inclusiveness, where having food and shelter is the norm rather than a privilege. 

Can Trump Win?

Whatever he is doing seems to be working.  The latest poll conducted by Fox News shows him trailing Hillary Clinton 39 to 41 percent, within the poll's 3 percent margin of error.  In other words a statistical tie. 

Drone Unknowns: ""I No Longer Love Blue Skies""
 by Priti Gulati Cox 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/08/drone-unknowns-i-no-longer-love-blue-skies/

One cloudy evening in April this year, a local cinema in Salina, Kansas screened the film 'Eye in the Sky,' a tale of the moral dilemmas facing those involved in drone warfare. The film was followed by an audience discussion. Many there expressed a feeling of having been at the edge of their seats while watching the gripping drama unfold. The movie was a one-hour, forty-three-minute advertisement for the U.S. military-industrial complex, with a spoonful of ethical dilemma slipped in as a digestive. Hollywood—the most dangerous illusionist of all—had once again jumped into the laps of our government and Intelligence agencies, fictionalizing and attractively packaging real issues that have real consequences for real people.

Is Israel Pushing For A Palestinian Civil War?
 by Dr Ramzy Baroud 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/08/is-israel-pushing-for-a-palestinian-civil-war/

Division within Palestinian society has reached unprecedented levels, becoming a major hurdle on the path of any unified strategy to end Israel's violent occupation or to rally Palestinians behind a single objective. Newly-appointed Israeli ultra-nationalist, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, understands this too well. His tactic since his ascension to office last May is centered on investing more in these divisions as a way to break down Palestinian society even further

Why Work Performed By Differently Abled Persons Do Not Get Due Recognition
by Kapil Kumar

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/08/why-work-performed-by-differently-abled-persons-do-not-get-due-recognition/

Based on my own experiences, I can say for sure that able bodied persons do not want to leave any space without hurdles, where a differently abled person can exist independently. This is because of the reason that it gives them an opportunity to declare disabled persons as non efficient, worthless, and incapable and so on. All of the spheres, whether it is education or employment, they are under their control. All these spaces operate on the wishes of able bodied persons. The reason behind this situation is their majority in the society.","Work, Energy, Money And Climate Change",link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/09/08/work-energy-money-and-climate-change/,2016-09-08 10:53:47,7,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0

The Anthropocene Epoch has officially begun. The Anthropocene is a geological epoch when human activity, namely rapid industrialization and nuclear activity, set global systems on a different trajectory. It is an epoch when human activity has created an incredible impact on the environment of our planet. The Earth is now on course to see 75 percent of species become extinct in the next few centuries if current trends continue. Homo Sapiens too could be one of the species to disappear from the face of the earth. We are our own undoing! Time to buckle up and take charge of our lives on a war footing. 
 
Yes, some are doing that already. The Zapitastas in the Chiapas mountains of Mexico. The Zapitastas have opened up space for a wide range of alternative ways of re-organizing societies, economies, and food systems. They've opened up new pathways in autonomous education, decolonization, and gender equity. They've also achieved food sovereignty and food security. Lessons to be learnt. 

Meanwhile the neo-liberal regime is hyperactive in enclosing the remaining commons managed by indigenous communities. Protected Natural Areas is a pet IMF/World Bank project practiced world over, taking control of the forests collectively conserved and managed by the indigenous communities and eventually pushing them out of the Commons. Ana de Ita tells such a story from Mexico. 

Day 53. Curfew lifted but shut down continues in the Kashmir valley.  People hold marches and rallies in many parts of the valley. Clashes break out and several people are injured. Meanwhile a soldier was killed while attempting to foil an infiltration attempt across the Line of Control. A defence source told IANS that Lance Naik Rajender Singh of 3 Raj Rifles was killed in the Sunderbani sector of the LoC in Rajouri.

And a lot of stories from around the world.

 The Anthropocene Is Here: Humanity Has Pushed Earth Into A New Epoch
by Deirdre Fulton 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/30/the-anthropocene-is-here-humanity-has-pushed-earth-into-a-new-epoch/

The Anthropocene Epoch has begun, according to a group of experts assembled at the International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa this week.
After seven years of deliberation, members of an international working group voted unanimously on Monday to acknowledge that the Anthropocene—a geologic time interval so-dubbed by chemists Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer in 2000—is real.

Food Sovereignty In Rebellion: Decolonization, Autonomy, Gender Equity, And The Zapatista Solution
by Levi Gahman 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/30/food-sovereignty-in-rebellion-decolonization-autonomy-gender-equity-and-the-zapatista-solution/

When viewed in its geopolitical context, the Zapatista insurgency has opened up space for a wide range of alternative ways of re-organizing societies, economies, and food systems. Consequently, what the Zapatistas prove through their resistance (i.e., efforts in autonomous education, decolonization, and gender equity) is that a recognition of Indigenous people's right to self-determination, in conjunction with anti-capitalist collective work and movements toward food sovereignty, can indeed provide viable alternatives to the world's neoliberal food regime as well as revolutionize the struggle for food security.

Using ""Protected Natural Areas"" To Appropriate The Commons
by Ana de Ita 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/30/using-protected-natural-areas-to-appropriate-the-commons/

Even as worldwide pressures mount to protect sites with high biological diversity, indigenous peoples and local communities are redoubling their struggles of resistance against a ""solution"" that claims to protect ecosystems, the establishment of protected natural areas (PNAs). The policy of establishing PNAs, which seeks to maintain the best conserved redoubts of the planet, is often at odds with the rights of native peoples, since many of those redoubts exist in the first place only because indigenous communities have conserved, recreated, and maintained them.

An international People's Demand for ""NO WAR"" (conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical or cyber), together with wider political realization of rapidly advancing GW-CC, could be a viable brake to the mindlessly competitive, relentless, lemming-like rush towards the brink of the precipice.

Prejudice Against Atheists Troubling
by Kristin Christman 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/30/prejudice-against-atheists-troubling/

The Democratic National Committee's conspiring to sabotage Bernie Sanders' campaign is disturbing on many levels, but what makes me livid is that the DNC was hoping to portray Bernie Sanders as an atheist. What's worse than the intended smear is the belief that branding someone an atheist is a smear.

The Kashmir Upspring
 by Sadiq Zafar 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/30/the-kashmir-upspring/

Generations have witnessed that the road which leads to New Delhi is blood-soaked. Under the camouflage of democracy India has done irreparable damage to generations. With its brutal and torturous armed forces, India has wiped away men who resisted against the oppression and atrocities, thus the biggest democracy failed in Kashmir and turned into an anarchist regime for the people of Kashmir.

After the campaign went viral and gaining international headlines, lots of worship places in India were opened up to women's entry which was hitherto denied to them. Even court orders followed allowing women entry into worship places.

Saffron Heads With Neutral Masks: Spreading Disharmony Through Social Media
 by T Navin 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/30/saffron-heads-with-neutral-masks-spreading-disharmony-through-social-media/

Such social media blogs, in the name of neutral media are only representatives of a highly reactionary right wing ideology. They can only be termed as Saffron heads with Neutral Masks. These are emerging as the representatives of the ruling party to 'manufacture consent' in favor of the party in power and Hindutva ideas. This poses a danger which needs to be exposed through establishing counter hegemony' by left, democratic, secular and progressive forces.

Loyalty
 by Gaither Stewart 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/30/loyalty/

Gaither Stewart explores the various forms that loyalty may take and in doing so raises questions about various relationships in our lives. For loyalty is perhaps the most bid for, but also most personal forms of connection and commitment. Much like trying to explain the multitudinous meanings of love, loyalty may not embrace and eschew love. I think that among the problems with our grasping what seems to be basic human concepts and attributes, is that the blasted English language is pitifully sparse when it comes to certain areas of the lexicon – certainly those things pertaining to life and relationships being a major one. This then loads immense amount of meaning, as well as ambiguity, onto a shakey platform of a few conjoined letters.","Food Sovereignty In Rebellion: Decolonization, Autonomy, Gender Equity, And The Zapatista Solution",link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/30/food-sovereignty-in-rebellion-decolonization-autonomy-gender-equity-and-the-zapatista-solution/,2016-08-30 12:36:04,12,0,5,12,0,0,0,0,0

Staying in Yemen Kieran Kelly argues that what's going on there and elsewhere in WANA is not just the militiary-industrial complex gone loose. He asks us to name the problem.

US Wars Are For Empire, Not For Profit
 by Kieran Kelly 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/29/us-wars-are-for-empire-not-for-profit/

The US empire is hollowing itself out. As it fails internally it will be ever more driven to impose control globally. As the 2016 Presidential campaign enters its crucial stage, we are entering the most dangerous period of history since the Cold War. We cannot afford to cling to delusions. We need to oppose US wars; evict US military bases; end mass surveillance and intelligence co-operation; reject neoliberalism and pro-corporate trade deals; and we need to reject the propaganda and discourse of US exceptionalism and apologism. When I say ""we"", I mean every single person on the planet (including people in the US itself). The empire has to be beaten back on all fronts, because otherwise there are two horrific options: either it collapses, or worse still it doesn't

In a way, society is the employer of Police personals. Their duty towards common masses is no favour from their side. Their job is not to take dictations from politicians only. They are not above people, rather they are for people. From society they come and towards society they have to return. Stop being like disguised mercenaries. Please.

When the major media outlets dramatize a particular event especially in relation to children and ignore or downplay other episodes, they are advancing the political agenda of some powerful actor. We should not be deceived. We would do well to remember the words of John Pilger, one of the most honest journalists of our time, ""It is not enough for journalists to see themselves as mere messengers without understanding the hidden agendas and myths that surround it.""

The mass media is creating sensations around what has become a national embarrassment with this contest of the lesser of the two crazies. On the one hand we have Donald Trump, depicted as a quintessential narcissist and on the other, Hillary Clinton who is often portrayed as a sociopath. Hype is created by putting these labels on the candidates, pitting one personality disorder against the other.

The Democratic candidate for the US Presidency, Hillary Clinton, is scandal-ridden. The life of the Clintons is a mere scandal starting way back with ""Whitewater"".[1] To call her ""crooked Hillary"" seems an understatement, viewing only her four years as Secretary of State. Her judgment and her trustworthiness are nil. Never before has there been in the recent history of the United States a greater conflict of interest of private personal gains (Clinton Foundation) and state power (Secretary of State Clinton).

The Oxaca Commune And The Zapitastas: Hope From The Margins
by Gustavo Esteva 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/28/the-oxaca-commune-and-the-zapitastas-hope-from-the-margins/

These notes offer a quick glance to ways, in the south of Mexico, in which people are regenerating the society from the bottom up. It is a new kind of revolution without leaders or vanguards, which goes beyond development and globalization. It is about displacing the economy from the center of social life, reclaiming a communal way of being, encouraging radical pluralism, and advancing towards real democracy.

The emergence of ISIS was definitely a byproduct of American-led militarism, and its containment will not be effectively achieved by reliance on militarism. The needed policies for such a hybrid war is a mixed strategy that emphasizes the political, seeks the higher moral and legal ground, and is imaginative about and receptive to diplomatic opportunities to restore security.

 by K P Sasi 

Whether the leaders of the communist parties in India have understood the debates on the implications of the profit oriented development model during the last four decades in India is not my concern at this moment. At least, they should learn from their own experiences of Nandigram and Singur. The Vizhinjam Transit Harbour is only a continuation of the same old mistakes.

 ""Protesters using children to attack forces"". De ja vu! Haven't you heard this before? Yes, you have heard this hasbara talk from Bibi Netanyahu, Avigdor Lieberman, Ayelet Shaked and many other Israeli politicians about Palestinians. Ironically,  the previous headline was from Times of India, India's leading English daily and it was uttered by none other than Chief Minister of Jammu & Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti! We know why Israeli politicians hate Palestinians, but I just don't know why a Kashmiri politician hates its own children!

Kashmir: Overshadowed Plebiscite
by Isma Zainab Arsheen

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/26/kashmir-overshadowed-plebiscite/

It's pitch dark outside as I write this as though life has decided this day to be last one. Army patrols on deserted lane outside my house are silhouettes laced with arms. Dogs are howling at a distance across street in repeated rhythms adding wilderness to imprisoned night. A faint light at a distance meets my eye as I peep through curtain crevices.  We are under curfew again. Indefinite one is the call this time. A brave heart has fainted every heart of my land by adieu to land he loved more than his budding youth. There is a strange calm outside, something of mixed feelings, something defining uneasiness, something of defiant voices muzzled and something about conspiracy of cheap blood. This is seventh night since Burhan's death, a young boy who kissed death in mad love of his beloved – Kashmir.

Critique Of CEDA's  ""Economics Of Climate Change"" – Neoliberalism Dooms Planet
 by Dr Gideon Polya 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/26/critique-of-cedas-economics-of-climate-change-neoliberalism-dooms-planet/

The highly influential but neoliberal Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) has published a detailed analysis entitled The Economics of Climate Change. However this report ignores a veritable Herd of Elephants in the Room apparent to science-informed climate change analysts, ignores the acute, existential  seriousness of the worsening climate emergency, and absurdly argues for effective Business As Usual (BAU) now to enable  a better  positioning for climate mitigation or climate adaptation in the future.

Subtle But Effective: Modern Forms Of Enclosures
 by Herve Le Crosnier 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/26/subtle-but-effective-modern-forms-of-enclosures/

The history of the commons can be read as the expansion of the market sphere and of private decision-making over goods that hitherto were subject to common rules. From this point of view, the late 20th century technologies are double-edged: They have made it possible to expand the commons by offering new modes of regulation, favoring the non-market sphere and creating new opportunities for human activity, particularly in cyberspace. Yet they can also empower private control over common resources, especially in the living world and the biosphere

Hillary Clinton Is Spreading Islamist Extremism

If the West in general and the United States in particular, left the Arab and Muslim world alone and in peace, we would most likely never see all those terrorist attacks, which are rocking the world from Indonesia to France. There would be no Mujahedeen and its mutation into al-Qaida; in Afghanistan or elsewhere. There would be no traces of the ISIS (or ISIL or I.S. or Daesh or however you choose to call it), in Syria, Iraq, Libya or anywhere else.

Turkey And The End Of An Era Of Imperial Control
 by Junaid S Ahmad 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/26/turkey-and-the-end-of-an-era-of-imperial-control/

All of the talk concerning Erdogan and his desire to revive some Turkish sultanate, Islamism and/or nationalism (take your pick) going wild in Turkey and in Pakistan, is fundamentally about one thing: the geopolitical anxieties of an empire in decline, unable to exert much muscle in bullying as it used to, only able to profit from billions in weaponry being sold to its 'moderate' Arab allies like Saudi Arabia. And ultimately, attempts at the reassertion and projections of American power by 'pivots' and expanding bases are crude cover-ups for the moral, political, and economic decay of the American imperium.

Newly leaked documents provide further details on what Harpers magazine calls the Clinton family's ""slush fund"", the Clinton Foundation. As Secretary of State (the US government position chiefly responsible for coordinating US international arms trafficking), Hillary Clinton accepted millions of dollars in ""donations"" from the dictator of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa, then increased US weapons sales to him by 137% during his brutal, Saudi-backed crackdown on pro-democracy protestors.

We've been following the Syrian imbroglio closely and the situation remains fluid. The Turkish army launched  a cross-border operation codenamed operation Euphrates Shield against American supported Kurdish militia and ISIS. US Vice President Joe Biden who arrived in Ankara has extended support to the Turkish operation.  The Kurdish militias have  been double-crossed by their US backers. It seems the Turkish aim is two fold 1) two prevent a Kurdish stronghold taking shape inside Syria. (Turkey is already fighting Kurds inside Turkey itself as well as in Iraq border) 2) to create a buffer zone inside Syria which is also a dream US imperialist agenda.  http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/25/biden-meets-with-erdogan-backs-turkish-invasion-of-syria/

The Korean peninsula is on the boil. 1) North Korea launched a  submarine missile which breached Japan's air defense zone. 2) US and South Korea have been involved in the joint annual drill which has irked North Korea. North Korean belligerance has made even its traditional backers, the Chinese, nervous. China, Japan and South Korea met for a trilateral meet and discussed North Korea. Remember, North Korea has as many as 21 nuclear bombs, enough to make us all nervous.

The governments have spent tens of billions of rupees on feeding and fighting the conflict rather than on alleviating poverty and improving literacy and health programs for the staggering number of poor in all of India and Pakistan. It was basically &  ultimately the exhumed external forces and greedy mindframe of these two extremely located countries and in part the spread of Islamic Fundamentalism in the Kashmir Valley that were instrumental in bringing about the insurgency of the late 1980s. Since that time, Kashmir has become overrun by these forces, and yet again the voice of Kashmir has become muffled under a global Islamic agenda

The 'NGO Law' is now in effect. It forces NGOs to declare their sources of funding and punishes those who refrain from doing so. It also levies heavy taxes on such funds, even when declared. The European Union, along with the United States Government warned Israel against such laws, but to no avail. The bill is written in too broad a terminology, thus making it possible for the government to target such organizations without appearing vindictive or politically-motivated.

Well known Gujarati poet SahilParmar's poem 'When I Was Born' perhaps reverberates these days in Gujarat when we are witnessing a Dalit Upsurge- a first of its kind at least in that regions history. It will be a talk of folklore for times to come how flogging of dalits in a village in Saurashtra by Hindutva fanatics suddenly erupted into a mass movement of dalits which could catch imagination of the people cutting across different sections of society. An attempt is being made here to understand the dynamics of the movement and its likely impact on the future trajectory of Hindutva.

The Syrian imbroglio is getting murkier and murkier. Turkey has started shelling Kurdish and ISIS forces in the Syrian border town of Jarablus. Having lost control of ISIS,  western forces are now supporting Kurdish militia. But Turkey has its own strategic interests against the Kurds gaining ground in Syria. Russia, China and Iran are all warming upto Turkey. Who pays the price? Alylan Kurdis and Omran Daqneeshs! Syria has become a chess board for great powers and the syrian people are the pawns easily sacrificed in the game.

The head of the United Nation's climate body has called for a thorough assessment of the feasibility of the international goal to limit warming to 1.5C. Dr Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), told delegates at a meeting in Geneva, which is designed to flesh out the contents of a special report on 1.5C, that they bore a ""great responsibility"" in making sure it meets the expectations of the international climate community. To be policy-relevant, the report will need to spell out what's to be gained by limiting warming to 1.5C, as well as the practical steps needed to get there within sustainability and poverty eradication goals.

Nonviolent Revolt In The Twenty-First Century
by Robert J Burrowes 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/24/nonviolent-revolt-in-the-twenty-first-century/

I sometimes wonder whether one of the ways in which 'Amercian exceptionalism' manifests is that many US scholars and others are unable to consider the contributions of those who are not from the USA. For example, I routinely read about studies of Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates (such as strategist James Lawson) in relation to nonviolence while the much more insightful and vastly greater contributions of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on the same subject are largely ignored by US scholars (although not, for example, by Professor Mary E. King, one of the best in the field).

Is humanity driven by love, kindness, compassion, trust and a sense of communal sharing or are we a species which predates on the weaker sections of the society?  A fact, 62 persons of this planet own as much wealth as half of the humanity!  So, are we selfish creatures who allow only the fittest to survive? I don't believe it. We are kind, loving and caring. Human nature has been turned upside down by predatory capitalism. The system has been hijacked. We and our children are taught that it is the natural state of affairs. The mass media and our education system are cahoots in this deception. How do we challenge it? Build our own educational system, build our own media which teach the values of living earth. Countercurrents.org is such an effort. As I wrote in the last news letter, we are the new rainbow warriors in the fight against forces of death. Over 14 years of hard work, we've built a small levee against the flood waters that is rushing in with death and destructi
 on.
We've to keep it standing. But it is an enormous task.

After my call went out last week seeking financial support to sustain countercurrents.org I saw lots of love, sharing and kindness. Thank you all who came forward to sustain Countercurrents. We managed to raise about Rs 4 lakh ($ 7000). We have not yet reached the half way mark.  For the last few days the contributions have dried up. That's worrying. That's why I'm writing again. Without your support this levee will not stand. The flood waters of capitalist destruction will wash it away. Let's all join together and strengthen it.  Yes, we need a biodiversity of resistance. We are the resistance fighters who have to protect our planet for the future generations.

Our subscription amount is Rs 1000 or $50.  Do come forward and strengthen Countercurrents.

The votaries of growth economics promise us a brighter future for our children and granchildren. People who have some sense built into them know that we can not keep growing infinitely in a finite planet. We'll have to hit the limit someday. Climate change, environmental calamities, growing economic equality, Peak Oil are all symptoms that we may have hit the limit. Of course, a time to panick. Do we have to resign to our fate? No. We can build a biodiversity of resistance, from bottom up and from top down. Dr Samuel Alexander of University of Melbourne argues that eco-marxism and eco-anarchism can join forces to form what he calls a ""Wild Democracy"". In a nutshell Wild Democracy functions on the simple logic that ""capitalism cannot be reformed; it has to be replaced."" 

How? Through a biodiversity of resistance.  He names a few of these resistance activities  ""transition towns; the divestment movement; sharing networks; intentional communities and ecovillages; permaculture groups; Occupy; manifestations of the gift economy; the voluntary simplicity and tiny house movements; deliberative democracy; community energy projects; activist hubs; artist hubs; alternative journalism websites; volunteer groups; farmers' markets; re-skilling workshops; charities; progressive non-profit enterprises and worker cooperatives; and the ever-expanding network of radical environmental and social justice groups that exist across the cultural landscape. The list could go on."" WHOA.... We are also they are! Our tiny little website Countercurrents.org is also is a resistance movement against destructive growth propelled capitalist ideology. We are the new rainbow warriors of resistance! March on, we'll create a new regenerative world. http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/23/wild-democracy-a-biodiversity-of-resistance-and-renewal/

 Wild Democracy: A Biodiversity Of Resistance And Renewal
 by Dr Samuel Alexander 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/23/wild-democracy-a-biodiversity-of-resistance-and-renewal/

The new revolutionary politics must be brought into the moment, into the present tense. We should not aim to destroy capitalism in the future but stop creating it, here and now, as best we can, knowing full well that we are too often locked into reproducing it against our wishes. But we must try to break free and swim against the tide, no matter how futile it seems. Revolution should be conceived of as a way of life rather than a goal to be achieved, and this revolution makes sense no matter our prospects of succes

Helsinki Timebank: Currency As A Commons
by Tero Toivanen 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/23/helsinki-timebank-currency-as-a-commons/

The main principle of timebanking is that everyone's time, work and needs are of equal worth. One hour of babysitting is equal to one hour of helping an elderly neighbor or providing accounting services. It is fair to say that this essential principle of timebanking stands in stark contrast to the premises of the current money system and capitalist markets, which value everyone's time and effort in highly unequal ways. Timebanking provides an alternative by helping people meet important personal and household needs in more socially satisfying, equal ways.

Mining As A Threat To The Commons: The Case Of South America

The struggle against mining in the region is often presented as opposition to development. In fact, the communities affected and environmental organizations are struggling to recover and exercise their basic human rights. This struggle will continue so long as mining corporations and governments rely upon the mining model to enclose the commons

 U.S. Invades Syria, And Warns Russia
by Eric Zuesse

On Monday, August 22nd, the United States government — which demands the overthrow of the internationally-recognized-as-legal government of Syria — officially announced that America's military forces in Syria will continue to occupy Syrian land, no matter what the Syrian government says, and will shoot down any Syrian planes that fly over U.S. forces there and that attack them.

BJP, Dalits, And The 'Cow Politics.'
 by George Abraham  

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/23/bjp-dalits-and-the-cow-politics/

The very idea of a consolidated vote bank based on the ideology of 'Hindutva' to include the Dalits and other backward castes may be fast unraveling as the video footage of the beating has gone viral and stoked Dalit Anger. The nation also witnessed the de-recognition of the Ambedkar Students Association in Chennai, mistreatment and subsequent suicide of the Dalit scholar Rohit Vemula in Hyderabad, torching of a Dalit home in Haryana and killing of the two children. All these incidents may only reinforce the age-old Dalit thinking that BJP is essentially a party dominated by an upper caste ideology, and there may be very little room left in it for anyone else!

Indian Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi, a rare orator and one of the few strong individuals ever produced in post-partition Bharat has expressed his displeasure with the way the Pakistan authorities are handling the cause of Balochistan.  The alarming expressions were a part of his Independence Day speech. Subsequent to his speech, many Indian pundits have come out with their versions and generated a canal of crocodile tears for the victims of state suppression in Balochistan.",March on...

A suicide bombing at a wedding party kills 51 people in Turkey. It seems Turkey is drawn more and more into the Middle East conundrum. Shortly before the Gaziantep bombing  Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said that his government is going to allow Moscow to use Incirlik air base to bomb ISIS in Syria. Remember, US had the sole use of this base since the Syrian civil war began. Remember also that around fifty American B-61 hydrogen bombs are also deployed in the Incirlik airbase! http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/22/suicide-bombing-kills-51-at-wedding-in-turkey/

Nauman Sadiq sheds further light in the geo-political shift in the Middle East in his article ""Shifting Alliances: Turkey, Russia And The Kurds"". US having lost control of the Frankenstein monster it created, the ISIS, is using Kurdish militia against the ISIS. It would be interesting to note that the Gaziantep bombing was at the wedding of a pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party member. President Erdoğan also said ""Initial evidence suggests it was an ISIS attack"". Well, well, well, Turkey pandering up to Russia and China, showing a cold shoulder to USA, turning against ISIS.... things are getting interesting in Turkey and Syria. I hope 'interesting'  not in the Chinese way!

Day 45. Kashmir is still under shutdown and curfew.  What's the way out? Nobody knows. Major General (Retd) S.G. Vombatkere  writes  that playing a passing the parcel game is not going to take us anywhere.  

In our Commons series Antonio Tricarico warns of a financial enclosure of the Commons. Whatever commons remaining is going to financialized and traded, creating new financial enclosures. He conludes the article,  ""In part, this is already happening. It is therefore urgent that civil society movements understand the financial industry's ambitions and act to stop them before it is too late.""

Long time CC writer Lionel Anet steps into the Commons debate. Anet analyses the whole history of civlization and comes to the conclusion that we've to become part of the Commons once again to avoid a catastrophic collapse.

Fifty-one people died and 69 were injured Saturday when a horrific suicide bombing hit a Kurdish wedding in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, near the border with Syria. At least 17 of the wounded are severely injured and clinging to life.

After the United States' reversal of regime change policy in Syria in August 2014 when Islamic State overran Mosul in Iraq in June 2014 and threatened the capital of another steadfast American ally, Masoud Barzani's Erbil in the oil-rich Iraqi Kurdistan, the Obama Administration has made the Kurds the centerpiece of its policy in Syria and Iraq.

There is a need to undo hartals and curfew, militarization and militancy, religious extremism and human rights violations. Let people breathe normal air and let our minds open. Demands for Pro Freedom, Pro India or Pro Pakistan, all are political dialogues and need to be dealt through political tools of dialogues, negotiations, meetings and continuous engagements of mutual prosperity to bring a positive output. Kashmir has all the capability to be known as 'ray of hope' that Gandhi said once.

The Coming Financial Enclosure Of The Commons
by Antonio Tricarico 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/22/the-coming-financial-enclosure-of-the-commons/

What will happen in the very next years will be crucial. The financial industry will seek to build the consensus and legal and physical infrastructure to achieve a finance-driven enclosure of the commons. To make all of this possible, states will be asked by corporate interests to enact new legislation and authorize new financial infrastructures through ad hoc regulations. In part, this is already happening. It is therefore urgent that civil society movements understand the financial industry's ambitions and act to stop them before it is too late.

What Does It Mean When War Hawks Say, ""Never Trump""? 
by Rebecca Gordon 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/22/what-does-it-mean-when-war-hawks-say-never-trump/

It's not every day that Republicans publish an open letter announcing that their presidential candidate is unfit for office. But lately this sort of thing has been happening more and more frequently. The most recent example: we just heard from 50 representatives of the national security apparatus, men — and a few women — who served under Republican presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush. All of them are very worried about Donald Trump. They think we should be alerted to the fact that the Republican standard-bearer ""lacks the character, values, and experience to be president.""

Illegal Reactor Experiments At The Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant, India
Co-Written By VT Padmanabhan & Joseph Makkolil

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/21/illegal-reactor-experiments-at-the-koodankulam-nuclear-power-plant-india/

What is being done at KKNPP-1 is known as 'power up-rate experiment' defined as ""the operation beyond the power level licensed by the regulatory body"" (IAEA). There are three types of power uprates: (i) ""measurement uncertainty recapture"" uprate, which involves an increase of less than 2% and is achieved by implementing enhanced techniques for calculating reactor power levels, (ii) ""stretch"" uprates where increases are between 2 and 7% and  (iii) ""extended"" uprates with increases of up to 20%.  Stretch and extended uprates involve changes to instrumentation settings and significant modifications to turbines, condensate pumps, motors, main generators and/or transformers. Since an uprated machine is made to work beyond the design limit, there is always a risk of an accident. This article, which is about this brave and bizarre experiment, is in three parts.  Part-I traces the history of uprating experiment at KKNPP by analyzing the performance of the reactor during December 2014 and August 2016, which reveals there were 188 successful uprated days

Lot of questioning by journos' almost amounting to interrogation, which Jignesh tackled very well. Jignesh Mevani was at the same time fire and brimstone lashing away at Mr. Modi and the BJP, and also Captain Cool as he suavely and minutely fielded the numerous questions from journalists, mostly representing the Gujarat newspapers. He resigned from the AAP today to keep the movement above party politics.

The Global Land Grab: The New Enclosures
 by Liz Alden Wily 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/20/the-global-land-grab-the-new-enclosures/

Everywhere the story is more or less the same: communal rights are being grossly interfered with, farming systems upturned, livelihoods decimated, and water use and environments changed in ways which are dubiously sustainable.

Let's Build A Regenerative World
by William Hawes 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/20/lets-build-a-regenerative-world/

Each town has to model itself to promote a viable village atmosphere, and foster a sense of community, with renewable energy, grassroots arts and music, and small to medium scale organic agriculture. It will mean embracing the truth that industrial civilization is destroying the world, and rather than wallowing in self-pity at having our illusions destroyed, rising up and embracing a culture based on ecology, enlightenment, and virtuous edification of our youth.

Instead, I put the challenge to you. I urge you to take a closer — much closer — look at what passes for culture on Planet Patriarchy. I urge you to carefully consider these words from Andrea Dworkin: ""Male supremacy is fused into the language, so that every sentence both heralds and affirms it.""

 Western Propaganda: So Simple But So Effective!

The Empire is killing millions and destroying countries and continents. But California is falling offa cliff, and clouds of huge insects are invading the entire North America. While millions of alien terrorists are now engulfing the 'tolerant' and 'democratic' Europe! So what is more terrible? Plus there are those sinister monsters like Count Vlad and Comrade Kim, waiting with their daggers behind a corner!

Hindutva cow vigilantes kill one of their own in India. The serpent devouring its own tail?

Staying on the positive side, we have a story from Cuba on how it came out of the devastating embargo as a resilient nation, a model of sustainable agriculture. A lot of lessons to be learnt from Cuba in our present situation. May be Cuba could be a template for us in a future shock caused by another economic calamity or climate change.

The Boy In The Ambulance Offers Glimpse Of 'Profound Horrors' In Syria
by Deirdre Fulton 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/19/the-boy-in-the-ambulance-offers-glimpse-of-profound-horrors-in-syria/

Laying bare the horrors of Syria's ongoing civil war, heartbreaking footage of a young boy rescued from the rubble following an airstrike in Aleppo has gone viral. Much as last year's photos of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi—""The Boy on the Beach""—offered a stark reminder of the human toll of the refugee crisis, the images of five-year-old Omran Daqneesh—""The Boy in the Ambulance""—are forcing many to consider the devastating realities of life in war-torn Syria, where more than 250,000 people, including many children, have died in almost five years of war.

Amazon Fires Threaten To Wipe Out Uncontacted Indigenous People
 by Survival International 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/19/amazon-fires-threaten-to-wipe-out-uncontacted-indigenous-people/

Forest fires are raging in an indigenous territory on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, threatening to wipe out uncontacted members of the Awá tribe. Small groups of neighboring Guajajara Indians were forced to spend days attempting to contain the blaze in the absence of government agents, until an Environment Ministry-led fire-fighting operation began last week.

It's the first time cow vigilantes killed its own man. BJP is the political wing of the right wing Hindutva ideological group, popularly known as Sangh Parivar.

The Commons: A Historical Concept Of Property Rights
 by Hartmut Zuckert 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/19/the-commons-a-historical-concept-of-property-rights/

The historical concept of the commons is a concept of property rights. If we historicize the contemporary debate about the commons and bring the historical concept of the commons into play, we must take that into account. Yet we must consider whether the question of property rights is even the central issue if we seek to solve global problems, and if so, how common-property rights can be fleshed out today

Why Trump Now?
by Nicholas C Arguimbau 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/19/why-trump-now/

 There is a disturbingly realistic assessment by Trump's followers that Trump won't kill constitutional government because it is already dead. Constitutional government will not win a decisive victory and likely not a victory at all unless Hillary makes a clean break with her all-too-well-known past and offers a full restoration of constitutional government..

Closing such centres would save billions and achieve something remarkable in Australian foreign policy: upholding international conventions it has long flouted with a sneer. It will also allow individuals kept in detention for over three years to taste something absent in their emotional diet for some time: the prospect of freedom.

 by Oliver DSouza

It is not surprising that the recent protests by dalits, especially the vigorous one in Ahmedabad following the Una incident in which four dalits were mercilessly beaten for skinning dead cows have evoked global attention: this is the first time in living memory that dalits have spontaeneously come together in large numbers to protest an atrocity committed over performing a caste forced occupation.

US Pushes Regime Change In South Sudan; UN Intervenes To Protect Rebel Leader
by Thomas C Mountain

The USA and its soon to be departed lap dog at the UN, General Secretary Ban Ki Moon are pushing for regime change in South Sudan. The reason the USA wants to rid itself of President Salva Kiir, the internationally recognized leader of South Sudan and replace him with rebel leader Reik Machar is because the US wants to deny China access to Africa's energy resources, with the Sudanese oil fields the only Chinese owned and operated in Africa. Its that simple, the USA is destabilizing South Sudan to deny China oil, period.

So many would like this to happen – to see Turkey go, to leave NATO, to break its psychological, political and economic dependency on the West. Now that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his allies are quarreling with the United States and the EU, there is suddenly great hope that Turkey may thoroughly re-think its position in the world, strengthen its ties with Russia and China, renew the historic friendship with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and improve its relationship with Iran.",HOW MANY MORE OMRANS DO WE NEED BEFORE SENSE PREVAILS?,link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/19/the-boy-in-the-ambulance-offers-glimpse-of-profound-horrors-in-syria/,2016-08-19 10:49:38,10,1,4,7,0,0,0,3,0

Russian bombers used an air base in the northwest of Iran for a second day Wednesday to attack targets inside Syria described by Moscow as arms depots and command centers used to support jihadist militias fighting Syrian government forces for control of the city of Aleppo.

by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/18/the-hypocrisies-of-commemoration-dispute-at-long-tan/

One of the stranger sights in international relations is that of a defeated State seeking to commemorate its fallen in a country whose affairs it sought to disrupt.  Australia is particularly adept at this, having obtained near exclusive entitlements to commemorate the landings at Gallipoli in Turkey on an annual basis, thereby inculcating successive generations with the notion that the wasteful engagement in April 1915 was in the name of ""freedom.""

 by Abdus Sattar Ghazali 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/18/the-real-reasons-behind-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment/

During the U.S. presidency of Barack Obama, Latin America was overshadowed by the Arab Spring, problems in Afghanistan and Ukraine, Travkin says. During that time, Brazil became an active member of the BRICS, and established long-term relationships, including economic and political ones, with Russia and China. The BRICS had become a new platform for discussions, which was an alternative to the current financial system based on the U.S. dollar. According Travkin, this seems to have caused great irritation in Washington.

Technology And The Commons
by Josh Tenenberg

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/17/technology-and-the-commons/

The Potato Park Of Peru
 by David Bollier

Drive an hour northeast from Cusco, Peru, and you will encounter some beautiful high mountain lakes, historic Inca ruins, and the richest diversity of potatoes on the planet. Approximately 2,300 of the 4,000 known potato varieties in the world are grown here, making it one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet. The 7,000 Quechua people who live on this high-altitude Sacred Valley of the Incas have, with their ancestors, cultivated and improved Andean potatoes for seven millennia. That impressive record stems from a holistic way of life that blends deep spiritual traditions and cultural values with cultivation techniques, barter and exchange practices and ecological stewardship

Taking a perspective of transformative social innovation, the study draws on case studies of 12 social innovation initiatives to analyze how these relate to new economies and to transitions toward new economic arrangements. All the networks we studied – including those not focusing on finance or economics – emphasize the need for a new economy.

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/17/fingers-on-the-button-first-use-and-us-nuclear-weapons/

Do you wait till the prospect of obliteration is upon you?  Or initiate, blithely, a nuclear holocaust upon your enemy as a matter of what is termed ""first use"" by the nuclear weapon high priests?  Neither prospect is particularly attractive, for each assumes the unthinkable made possible, madness made real.

There comes a time when one needs to speak; I speak of the Una Independence Day Rally of Dalits, at the end of a 10-day 400-km Dalit Asmita Yatra following a massive Dalit congregation at Ahmedabad, Gujarat, on July 31.

The Dalit march from Ahmedabad to Una has emerged as an important social revolt of the Dalits in Gujarat.This mass up-surgence is challenging the very base of the caste system. It is questioning the logic of division of work based on clean and unclean tasks among upper castes and Dalits respectively

CAMPA: The Return Of British Raj To Forest
 by Gladson Dungdung 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/17/campa-the-return-of-british-raj-to-forest/

CAMPA is a great setback to the forest rights of the Adivasis and other forest dweller communities. There is huge fund Rs. 42,000 crore remained unspent under CAMPA fund and there would be availability of additional Rs. 600 crore every year under the CAMPA fund. Hence, the Indian Bureaucracy is overwhelmed to enforce the CAMPA, which will provide them a great opportunity for harvesting.

On 15 August, a First Information Report was reportedly registered against Amnesty International India with regard to an event held on 13 August, based on a complaint filed by an ABVP representative. The allegations mentioned in the complaint are without substance. They are preventing the families of victims of human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir from having their stories heard. And preventing civil society organisations from enabling these families to exercise their constitutional right to justice.

Subsistence: Perspective For A Society Based On Commons
by Veronika Bennholdt-Thomsen 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/16/subsistence-perspective-for-a-society-based-on-commons/

Neither subsistence nor commons are vestiges of bygone centuries; on the contrary, they continue to fulfill necessary functions and embody perspectives that point to the future. Yet the opposite view is propagated. The privatization (of land, water and other things) and the commercialization of commons (for example, air or genes), which restricts access or even eliminates them for many people, are actually considered serious solutions for global problems such as hunger and climate change. ""To draw farmers from subsistence to commercial agriculture"" has been the declared policy of the World Bank since the mid-1970s.

The Solar Transition
by Andrew Curry 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/16/the-solar-transition/

Although futurists aren't supposed to make predictions, the notion that our energy system is switching much more quickly than expected from fossil fuels to renewables, and that solar energy will be at the front of that change, suddenly doesn't seem so controversial. Of course, the speed of the change still matters, certainly in terms of global warming outcomes. And yet until recently the notion that solar energy would be the leading energy source was a possible future that was, broadly, regarded as impossible.

Sanders has created a large constituency for further political advances against the erosion of what remains of true democracy and equality in the existing neocapitalist system. It is to be hoped that the genuine left in America will seriously seek to attract and organize members of this new force for intensive radical political activism and not simply for electoral politics.

In its after-life of half-a-century, the report continues to occupy an important place in discussions on education in India irrespective of the distinct ideological positions that may go on to frame these discussions. While some of the recommendations get echoed by a wide range of bodies including policy and planning groups, civic initiatives and organisations of radical persuasions, certain other issues raised by the report have been relegated to the back allies of our collective memory.

Thousands of Dalits gathered in Una, Gujarat on Independence Day pledged never to do sanitation work and never to dispose off dead cattle ever again.

 by Jonathan Cook

It is Israel's darkest secret – or so argues one Israeli journalist – in a country whose short history is replete with dark episodes. Last month Tzachi Hanegbi, minister for national security, became the first government official to admit that hundreds of babies had been stolen from their mothers in the years immediately following Israel's creation in 1948. In truth, the number is more likely to be in the thousands.

Why Distinguish Common Goods From Public Goods?
by James B Quilligan 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/15/why-distinguish-common-goods-from-public-goods/

Not only does the commons vanish through this legal and linguistic shuffle, even the word ""public"" is stolen from the people. ""Public"" no longer signifies a community's authority to manage its local resources and express its own social or ecological demands; ""public"" now means the central governing authority to whom we have surrendered the control of these resources, which then meets our demand through conventional private markets.

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/15/caste-the-actual-cost-of-empowerment-dalit-women-nrega-a-study-of-the-poverty-social-exclusion-shame-nexus/

This book ""The Actual Cost of Caste: MGNREGA On The Ground"" seeks to examine the lives of rural Dalit women in private as well as public spheres. A theoretical framework of poverty, shame and social exclusion has been used to explore the objectives. The study goes further and analyses one of India's biggest social security programs, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, and to what extent it has provided Dalit women with a shield that can protect them from who they are, what they are and where they are. The study uses Dalit feminism as a stand point, and utilizes the available data and literature to analyze the aforementioned objectives.

 The Tragedy Of The Anticommons
  by Michael Heller 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/13/the-tragedy-of-the-anticommons/

This essay introduces the tragedy of the anticommons. What's that? Let's start with something familiar: a commons. When too many people share a single resource, we tend to overuse it – we may overfish the oceans and pollute the air. This wasteful overuse is a tragedy of the unmanaged commons. How do we solve such a tragedy?

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/13/how-to-break-the-power-of-money/

We are living beings born of and nurtured by a living Earth. Life exists—can exist—only in living communities that self-organize to create the conditions essential to life's existence. Money is just a number, an accounting chit we accept in exchange for things of real value because we have been conditioned to do so almost from birth.

US Military Prepares New Offensives In Syria And Iraq
  by Peter Symonds

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/13/us-military-prepares-new-offensives-in-syria-and-iraq/

Even as tensions are rising with Russia in Eastern Europe and China in Asia, the United States has launched a new war in Libya and is preparing a major military escalation in the Middle East, nominally directed against Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In an interview yesterday with USA Today, Air Force Lieutenant General Jeffrey Harrigan confirmed that the US-led coalition is planning coordinated offensives against two ISIS-held cities—Mosul in northern Iraq and Raqqa in Syria.

Donald Trump And The ISIS Factor
  by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/13/donald-trump-and-the-isis-factor/

Ever straddling that fine line between the absurd and the puncturing revelation, Donald J. Trump's ""ISIS"" remarks about the Obama administration and the Democrat presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, were vintage.  ""[Obama] was the founder of ISIS absolutely, the way he removed our troops. … I call them [Obama and Hillary Clinton] co-founders."" In a political environment where sarcasm is set aside in favour of serious management and public relations choreography, stage managed with careful insertions for media effect, Trump has other ideas. These may be contemptuous of the archive of history, avoiding evidence like the plague, but every so often, he makes a point that stings.

How Obama AdministrationEncouraged The Rise Of Islamic State?
 by Nauman Sadiq 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/13/how-obama-administrationencouraged-the-rise-of-islamic-state/

Although, I admit that Donald Trump's recent remarks that Obama Administration willfullycreated the Islamic State were a bit facile, but it is an irrefutable fact that Obama Administration's policy of nurturing the Syrian militants against the Assad regime from August 2011 to August 2014 created the ideal circumstances which led to the creation of not just Islamic State but myriads of other Syrian militant groups which are just as fanatical and bloodthirsty as Islamic State.

Uncle ""Sham"" Says ""Dance""…. And The Band Plays On….
 by Gary Corseri 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/13/uncle-sham-says-dance-and-the-band-plays-on/

Those political, Republicratic ""Conventions"" clarified nothing and–despite the glitter, sparkle, balloons and flags, the pledges of allegiance, hands over the Constitution &/or one's heart, the pretty words and gruff challenges—they succeeded in confounding and bewildering.

Narendra Modi, The Machiavellian Prince Of India
  by Sukumaran C V 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/13/narendra-modi-the-machiavellian-prince-of-india/

We have a Prime Minister who said that this government is for the Dalits, and the same Prime Minsiter says nothing when Dalits are publicly flogged by the gau rakshaks. Everybody knows on whose side he stands, but with his rhetoric he tries to convince the civilised world that he criticises the vigilantism that targets the Dalits.

The Flagging Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: The US Election And Free Trade Politics
by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/12/the-flagging-trans-pacific-partnership-agreement-the-us-election-and-free-trade-politics/

Heartening here is that much of the sabotage is coming from within Washington itself, an entirely apt state of affairs, given that the very concept began there.  But if Clinton does win, a change of opportunistic heart may well be in the offing.

In a clear signal of American imperialism's unrelenting commitment to the Saudi monarchy and its ongoing war against Yemen, the United States' State Department approved the sale of one hundred and fifty Abrams main battle tanks to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

New Emails Shed Further Light On Hillary Clinton's Corruption As Secretary Of State
 by Evan Blake

The newly released emails, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, implicate Clinton in incriminating conflict-of-interest deals, in which Clinton's aides worked to hire a Clinton Foundation associate and provided political connections for at least one of the Foundation's wealthy donors. Another email directly connects the finance giant and Clinton backer Morgan Stanley to her diplomatic maneuvers in China.

Why Say No To The TPP? Corporations Already Have Too Much Power
by Sarah van Gelder 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/12/why-say-no-to-the-tpp-corporations-already-have-too-much-power/

Instead, our hope lies in shifting power to communities and regions—urban and rural—that prioritize safety, clean air, children's health, and locally rooted livelihoods. The benefits might be invisible to economists and policy makers, because they can't all be measured in profits and dollars. But human well-being and ecological resilience are what matter, whether in the streets of our cities and towns or in Nebraska's abundant harvest of heirloom red corn.

Obama And Clinton Co-Founders Of ISIS?
 by Jon Kofas 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/12/obama-and-clinton-co-founders-of-isis/

The lesson here is not just the lengths to which a presidential candidate would go to secure more popular support using rhetoric one would associate with politicians in less developed countries where political opponents have no qualms suggesting it may not be a bad idea to eliminate the other. The lesson is that no matter the propaganda by the media, pundits, politicians, academics, and all who pretend that terrorism came like the blob from another planet are now unable to hide behind this enemy.

 Hilary Clinton – History Repeats Itself?
by Andre Vltchek 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/12/hilary-clinton-history-repeats-itself/

Both of this year's US Presidential candidates have, undoubtedly, their doubles in the not so distant past. While Donald Trump's ones lived in the 20th Century in Germany and Italy, Hilary Clinton had a homegrown predecessor; a man who was defending slavery and the status quo and who, most importantly, turned the United States into an aggressive imperialist and neo-colonialist power.

""Clinton in 2008 sa[id] she won't drop out of the primaries because if someone assassinates Obama she can still win"": Indeed, Keith Olberman here chastises Clinton for almost 11 minutes about her inappropriate comments, in which, unlike Trump, she actually used the word ""assassination"" in reference to the reason why she should stay in the presidential primary against Obama.

Language Patterns, The Media, And Cultural Re-Storying

It falls to us all to be more mindful of the language we use and the stories we tell, especially educators, policy-makers, authors, song-smiths, parents and performers. Stories can indeed change the world — and if they are used carefully, wisely, and with love, they can change it for the better. That, though, will require us all to move from the language of dominion to a language of belonging.

Human Nature: An Evolutionary Paradox
by John Scales Avery

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/12/human-nature-an-evolutionary-paradox/

The religious leaders of today's world have the opportunity to contribute importantly to the solution of the problem of war. They have the opportunity to powerfully support the concept of universal human brotherhood, to build bridges between religious groups, to make intermarriage across ethnic boundaries easier, and to soften the distinctions between communities. If they fail to do this, they will have failed humankind at a time of crisis.

Review: Samah Sabawi's'Tales Of A City By The Sea'
by Gillian Hunt 

Australian-Palestinian playwright and poet, Samah Sabawi knows better than most how quickly a conversation stalemates when it turns to Gaza, her birthplace. She is also deeply aware of the power of story to open that conversation and gently draw people into the reality of what it is to live in Gaza, to love Gaza, to suffer there and to want the world to understand and respond. Her play, Tales of a City by the Sea, tells the story of different people living and working in Gaza in recent times. It is written with the compassion of one born there, yet one who is able to step outside to witness what life is like for its inhabitants and those who are motivated to offer assistance.

Pakistan's Dirty War In Balochistan
by Abdus Sattar Ghazali 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/12/pakistans-dirty-war-in-balochistan/

The Pakistani government has branded Baloch separatist organizations as ""terrorists."" The Balochs suffer from high rates of poverty, low literacy and other woes — all of which serve to fuel an insurgency. According to the World Bank, eight of Pakistan's 10 most deprived districts are located in Balochistan. Just 22 percent of Balochs are literate, versus 47 percent for Pakistan as a whole, and only 20 percent of Balochs have access to drinking water, versus 86 percent for the country.","Insha Malik, Victim Of Pellet Attack, Suffering From Deadly Brain Infection",link,http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/12/insha-malik-victim-of-pellet-attack-suffering-from-deadly-brain-infection/,2016-08-12 08:21:04,41,2,33,22,0,0,0,7,12

 Media Silence And The Agrochemicals Industry: The Slow Poisoning Of Health And The Environment  
by Colin Todhunter 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/11/media-silence-and-the-agrochemicals-industry-the-slow-poisoning-of-health-and-the-environment/

It's an all too common tale of dirty deeds, shady deals and propaganda. Rosemary Mason's recent open letter to journalists at The Guardian outlines how the media is failing the public by not properly reporting on the regulatory delinquency relating to GM food and the harmful chemicals being applied to crops. Much of the media is even (unwittingly) acting as a propaganda arm for big agritech companies.

Now she realizes that her calculations did not, do not and will not pay in the way that she and her friends anticipated. She must be appreciated for the courage she has manifested in the withdrawal of the fast.

A profound respect for her decision, however, unpalatable it might be for many, is the dire need of the hour

Kashmir: Siege Without End!
by Mohammad Ashraf 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/11/kashmir-siege-without-end/

It is a total siege. Everything is shut. Even the Central Government offices, Banks, Post Offices, Schools, and Colleges are all shut. There appears to be total absence of any administrative machinery. The situation has been compounded by total break in communications. Internet has been shut, so have been the mobile phones and for some days even the local newspapers. One can only imagine the inconvenience caused to patients especially those requiring continuous chemotherapy and other life-saving treatments. Most pathetic is the suffering of the specially challenged children who used to be daily looked after in various facilities. Hospitals are overloaded and the staff highly over worked while treating the casualties of extreme brutality.

Kashmir: Pushed Against The Wall
by Imran Khan 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/11/kashmir-pushed-against-the-wall/

It must be understood that when so called democracy is put to gallows, when continuous occupation and not conflict resolution is the focus, when aim of dialogue is just to buy time and put the issue in limbo, when the promises made to Kashmiries are continuously broken, when nonviolent and unarmed protests are reciprocated with bullets and pellets, what options India is leaving for the new, fearless and educated generation of Kashmir?

Curfew As An Instrument Of Mass Torture In Kashmir
by Dr P S Sahni 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/11/curfew-as-an-instrument-of-mass-torture-in-kashmir/

In good old days British colonial rulers used to impose collective fines and punishment on people demanding freedom and justice. Even as the entire populace in Kashmir is being collectively punished, could one dare ask for what crime? What is the crime of an infant or a ninety year old person that they are subjected to house detention under curfew? Why should a child be deprived of playing outside his/her house?Why should an old person be prevented from walking near his/her house? If the rulers in Delhi are hell bent upon punishing the entire populace of Kashmir, there should be a realization that the young child may not even understand that he or she is being punished. So even the very limited purpose of punishing the people may not be really achieving its 'objective'.

Norma Hashim's engagement with the issue of Palestinian prisoners has previously produced one book — The Prisoners' Diaries: Palestinian Voices from the Israeli Gulag — which has been described by former hunger-striker Hana al-Shalabi as ""A humane, beautiful, valuable but painful book."" Hashim's Dreaming of Freedom is worthy of a similar description. In this collection children recount their experiences of solitary confinement, beatings, torture and humiliation while in Israeli detention.

Bungling The Australian Census
 by Dr Binoy Kampmark 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/11/bungling-the-australian-census/

Each country needs its exceptionalist message, its sui generis theme. We do something here no one else does, and such like. In Australia, there are many things deemed exceptional.  Compulsory voting, on pain of a fine, is one such case.  Compulsory voting in a census is another extension of that same philosophy. To not submit, and be damned by the extortionist drive of the State.

Rethinking The Social Welfare State In Light Of The Commons
 by Brigitte Kratzwald 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/11/rethinking-the-social-welfare-state-in-light-of-the-commons/

In many cases, governments have proven to be poor trustees of the things entrusted to them. Discontent about how they are doing their job is on the rise. People are standing up and taking responsibility with the words, ""This is ours, and we want to make the decisions about it."" Only through this process are these things becoming truly public goods and services. In this way, people are reclaiming control over the direct circumstances of their lives. We have been witnessing such processes of reclaiming in great numbers in recent years, going far beyond the demand for sufficient funding of public institutions and services.

An Updated Version Of The ""Peak Oil"" Story
 by Gail Tverberg 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/09/an-updated-version-of-the-peak-oil-story/

We should not be surprised if the financial problems that the world is now encountering will eventually resolve badly. This seems to be how the Peak Oil story will finally play out. Without rising energy per capita, the world economy tends to shrink. Without economic growth, it becomes very difficult to repay debt with interest. Wealth disparity becomes more and more of a problem, and it becomes increasingly difficult for governments to collect enough revenue to support their needs. Our problems begin to look more and more like those of earlier economies that hit resource limits, and eventually collapsed.




An Open Letter To Mehbooba Mufti

First Thoughts For A Phenomenology Of The Commons
by Ugo Mattei 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/09/first-thoughts-for-a-phenomenology-of-the-commons/

The commons are not concessions. They are resources that belong to the people as a matter of life necessity. Everybody has a right of an equal share of the commons and must be empowered by law to claim equal and direct access to it. Everybody has equal responsibility to the commons and shares a direct responsibility to transfer its wealth to future generations. The commons radically oppose both the State and private property as shaped by market forces, and are powerful sources of emancipation and social justice. 




The Election From Hell
by Tom Engelhardt 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/09/the-election-from-hell/

As the world careens toward ""an environment never experienced before,"" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one of the two parties to the American spectacle continues to insist that climate change is a hoax.Meanwhile, the other party, the one theoretically promoting much-needed responses to climate change, wasn't even willing to highlight the subject in prime time on any of the last three days of its convention. In other words, the deepest, most unnerving realities of our world are, in essence, missing in action in election 2016. You want to be afraid? Be afraid of that!




Why Urban Rich Kids, Not Poor Taliban Terrorise Bangladesh?
 by Taj Hashmi 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/09/why-urban-rich-kids-not-poor-taliban-terrorise-bangladesh/

Since terrorism is a political not an Islamic problem, promoting any ""de-contaminated"" Islam would change nothing. We need to understand what the terrorists want to reform, before trying to reform them. But first of all we need transparent and accountable governance with equal opportunity for all. Historically, poverty-stricken classes never staged any revolutionary or terrorist movement anywhere in the world. The poor, marginalized, and uninformed madrasa students in Bangladesh are too weak and disorganized to spearhead any violent or revolutionary movement. This explains why urban, rich, and secular-educated – not rural, poor, and madrasa-educated – youths are the main foot soldiers of Islamist terror in Bangladesh.




Cow Protectors: Fake And Real
by T Navin 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/09/cow-protectors-fake-and-real/

Violence in the name of cow protection has been integral part of Hindu mobilization by Sangh Parivar. In 2002, five Dalits were lynched to death in Jhajjar, Haryana, by a frenzied mob. At the heart of the incident was the cow-slaughter theory. In January 2003, VHP attacked home of a Muslimunder the pretext of cow slaughtering. Within hours 132 of 144 Muslim shops were burnt by Sangh Parivar. Dadri and Gujarat incidents are only the recent ones. Such instances only show that non-violent nature of real cow protectors in the form of sangh parivar is only an illusion.

Pointing fingers is our national pass time. Just when are we going to find the 'WE' in the valley? For normalcy to dawn on these people's lives, it's imperative we challenge our own ignorance first. For getting things back to the negotiation table, we need to purge our romanticization, hypocrisy, double standards and most importantly, the stereotyping of the valley and its people.

The Turnbull government has come down rather heavily in its response to a spate of attacks in France and Germany, deciding that it is time that something be done in the face of this supposed global madness.  The prime minister Malcolm Turnbull decided to press the issue in a letter to state leaders urging for the creation of a national regime to indefinitely detain terrorists even after the point of serving their sentence.

The U.S. public has been kept in the dark or misled about foreign policy for much of our history. For example, as we commemorate the 71st anniversary of the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, let's re-examine the myth of necessity of those barbaric acts. The myth that just won't die and is believed by most Americans is that these bombings saved millions of lives and were necessary to end WWII in the Pacific.

The Clinton camp, which appears to be gaining adherents within the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon, believes that the Obama administration's policy toward Russia and Syria is badly flawed partly because, so they claim, Obama wrongly assumes that Russia wants to limit its involvement in Syria.

Most of us know that the then Communist Party of India opposed the Quit India Movement  thus betraying a great phase of mass upsurge in the history of the freedom struggle. However, what role the then Hindutva camp—consisting of the Hindu Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh —played in the QIM is under wraps for reasons unknown. The Hindutva camp not only opposed QIM but also provided multi-faceted and multi-dimensional support to the British rulers in suppressing this historic mass upsurge.

Hiroshima And Nuclear Power: The Truth Of The Matter
 by S G Vombatkere 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/06/hiroshima-and-nuclear-power-the-truth-of-the-matter/

Opposition to nuclear bombs and nuclear power has been expressed right from 1946 onwards, and the arguments have become more comprehensive, cogent and forceful with the passing years. This has developed into a school of thought and peaceful action which the ruling political class, under thrall of the nuclear industry, pejoratively dubs ""anti-nuclear"". However, those who oppose nuclear bombs and nuclear power are primarily concerned with problems of life, livelihood, health and safety of present and future generations of human and non-human life, and thus are pro-life rather than anti-nuclear.




Why the Modern Nuclear Project Will Persist: At Least Until We Focus Action On Why It Is Persisting
 by Jim Hickey 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/06/why-the-modern-nuclear-project-will-persist-at-least-until-we-focus-action-on-why-it-is-persisting/

Capitalism's continued operation cannot break free of fission and fusion and all the other capital intensive tricks that for a time both cure its contradictions and consolidate its imprimatur.  This link guarantees in time that nuclear war will happen. That nuclear war equals likely extinction is obvious.  Therefore, human survival has as one of its first commandments this: we must end the rule of the bourgeoisie, or we will all burn till all that remains of us is irradiated ash.




Resilience Thinking
by Rob Hopkins 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/06/resilience-thinking/

""Resilience,"" I would argue, is a vitally important additional dimension to the concept of sustainability, or to its oxymoronic offspring, ""sustainable development."" Without resilience, the terms do not adequately address the nature of the challenge we face. Let's take a supermarket as an example. It is possible to increase its sustainability and to reduce its carbon emissions by using less packaging, putting photovoltaics on the roof and installing more energy-efficient fridges. It could stock mostly organic produce and have biodegradable packaging on all its products.

In the countries like Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States the doctrine of the Battered Woman Syndrome has gained legitimacy in psychological and legal sphere and is applied to defend those women survivors of domestic violence who are held guilty of killing their oppressors under the law. The courts in India have not applied the Battered Woman Syndrome concept until recently when the Delhi High Court in its landmark verdict while applying this doctrine hold a male accused guilty of abetting suicide of his wife. This work looks at this doctrine of the Battered Women Syndrome and its applicability in the Indian context

Any effort to suggest that keeping India 'clean' drive is just an initiative without any linkage to caste discrimination and untouchability means hiding the dirty reality of India. Frankly, India will only be 'clean' the day it will not link sanitation work to a particular community and end up caste discrimination and untouchability. Swachch Bharat is not possible without an honorable rehabilitation of the community of manual scavengers and it will be totally hypocratic without the complete decimation of the caste system and untouchability.

In our Commons series we have an article  by Friederike Habermann ""We Are Not Born As Egoists"". Yes we are not. But under the current socio-political-economic-financial system we are doing exactly opposite to our human nature. We have a clear cut example to it today. The CAMPA bill passed by Indian parliament puts a price tag to our forests and will be sold to the highest bidder. At peril are the Adivasis of India for whom the forests are their life blood, more generally the environment, our ecosystems at a global level it will expedite the Climate Change crisis. It's a tragedy for us all who see the forest as The Commons. All the more reasons to understand The Commons, protect our Commons and devise startegies to stop this run-away train.

CAMPA Has Greed Written All Over It

The Compensatory Afforestation Fund Bill, also known as the CAMPA bill, which was passed last week by the RajyaSabha (Upper House) of the Indian Parliament will not just lead to more cutting offorests, but also compromise forest and indigenous communities rights. That the fund has accumulated a whopping Rs 42,000 crores during the last decade is worrying enough considering the huge amount of deforestation that this fund legitimizes

The Decay Of American Politics
 by Andrew J Bacevich 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/05/the-decay-of-american-politics/

The thicket of unreality that is American politics has now become all-enveloping.  The problem is not Trump and Clinton, per se.  It's an identifiable set of arrangements  — laws, habits, cultural predispositions — that have evolved over time and promoted the rot that now pervades American politics.  As a direct consequence, the very concept of self-government is increasingly a fantasy, even if surprisingly few Americans seem to mind.




 UK  Parliament Endorses Terracidal Nuclear Terrorism  
 by Dr Gideon Polya 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/05/uk-parliament-endorses-terracidal-nuclear-terrorism/

The UK Parliament recently overwhelmingly supported renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system, with a psychopathic  new UK PM Theresa May declaring her preparedness to kill vast numbers of people with nuclear weapons. Total nuclear disarmament can and should happen. On the eve of the 71st anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, decent people around the world must declare a peaceful war on nuclear terrorist supporters and countries  by Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) that are most likely to be  effective when applied to small nuclear powers like the UK , France, North Korea and Apartheid Israel.

On April 19th, the U.S. State Department had blocked entrance into the United States by Raed Saleh, the head of the White Helmets, and refused to say why. Saleh had been invited to receive in NYC an award by USAID and NGOs that the U.S. government finances, but he was barred at the airport, apparently because the FBI had placed him onto its no-fly list as a known terrorist.




Is Democracy Consistent With Islam?
by Nauman Sadiq 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/05/is-democracy-consistent-with-islam/

Some people are under the impression that democracy and Islam are incompatible. But I don't see any contradiction between democracy and Islam, as such. Though, I admit, that there is some friction between Islam and liberalism. When we say that there is a contradiction between Islam and democracy, we make a category mistake which is a serious logical fallacy.

One doesn't often see a respected international media house asking a democratic republic's prime minister to break his silence in an editorial. Even more rare is it to see this ""silence"" tagged with the adjective ""shameful"". The New York Times did exactly that on 8 August 2016. The editorial forewarns Mr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, of the bleak future awaiting him and his political party if he ""does not break his shameful silence on cow vigilantes, and reset his political compass on a course of economic opportunity, dignity and justice.""

Armed Struggle Is Not Terrorism
 by Abdul Majid Zargar 

http://www.countercurrents.org/2016/08/05/armed-struggle-is-not-terrorism/

The more I read or listen to the debates & discourses on Indian media, both print & electronic, the more I am bemused at the ignorance or deliberate attempt to ignore the fundamental question of Kashmir dispute. That question is simply a political one created by an international promise of right of self determination to people of J&K upon partition of British India in two domains India & Pakistan. The two successor states have duly accepted to implement this promise in letter & sprit. Indian Writers or debaters, with few honorable exceptions, would simply like to skip  or  reduce this question to terrorism which  reared its head after Nineties around the same time when Kashmiris started their armed struggle.

It has now become a pattern for RSS to disown its own actions which emanate from its divisive Hindutva mindset. The RSS plays the game of association and disassociation. It associates with masses and its own saffron network and spreads hatred through multiple ways till an event occurs. It continues to promote a divisive mindset till then. However, as protests arise and their actions become unpopular and receive criticism, it immediately disassociates itself from the act.

By the end of schooling, the young are yoked, through fear and the promise of salvation if they succeed. If they fail, as indeed most do, they are consigned to lesser destinies.

According to the FIR filed by her parents, there were only 4 girls at the hostel as all the other girls had gone home and had not returned by then. On the evening of 28th, at 8 pm, she called her father and told him that their Warden Priya Shukla had sent her to the PT Instructor Vijendra Singh's room, with the excuse of cleaning the hostel (this shows the clear collusion of the warden in the case). There, Delta was raped by Vijendra Kumar Singh, the PT teacher. The Institute , in an attempt to cover up the incident, took written apology from both her and the PT Instructor with a statement that this happened with mutual consent. The usual strategy of victim blaming was used in the most brutal manner against a 17 yr old girl

However what is most ironical is the recent claim laid by the BJP-RSS over the legacy of Bhagat Singh. This comes from an organization that has not produced even a single freedom fighter. Therefore there is a need to liberate Bhagat Singh from these different versions that political parties and historians have produced conveniently to suite their own kind of nationalism

Dear Professor Podile

Turning out Dalit students (http://www.countercurrents.org/pvk0060116.htm) from their accommodation on political /racist grounds is not a good look for a university bent on attracting international interest.

But then  not too surprising after reading  UoH's Vision and Mission  which has no  reference to the learning responsibility to ethics and morality.

The great universities stand at the leading edge of  educational and moral progress,. They do not slouch backward into dark age class discrimination and suppression of rightful dissent.  

I urge UoH to reinstate the shamefully expelled 5 Dalit students immediately and unconditionally and respect student dissent against injustice by maintaining integrity against the Hindutva pressures.

Why do I stand in solidarity with ViBGYOR?

""Does one really need a reason other than being a 'citizen' to stand up and be counted for freedom of speech, for right to dissent in the face of increasing authoritarian assault, for the right of the people at the margins to speak and to be heard? Does one really need a reason other than the quest of an Adivasi friend from Bastar to tell her story- a story full of deceits from those supposed to protect her- a story none in corporate media would tell? Does one really need a reason to join hands with those documenting the 'suicides', in fact murders by means of absolutely 'non violent' harassment of scores of bright Dalit students in IITs of the 'republic'?

I stand in solidarity with the ViBGYOR because but for them, and their and therefore my comrades, I would not have known much about the valiant Chengara Struggle, or of Save Maudani campaign, exactly what those attacking them wanted of me. I stand by them for being the linkage, like many others, that put all of us together with all our battles- both of personal/collective survival and political convictions. I stand with them for their conscientious and fearless positions for the wretched of the earth, be them any where. I stand in solidarity with them for their courage, the courage of putting them at risk in Kerala for the tears of a Kashmiri eye. 

I stand by them because not standing by them is not a choice in the face of the Hindutva Fanatic assault on my country. I stand by them for I don't want my country to become a Islamic State, albeit of Hindutva Fascist variant. 

Stand up, be counted, keeping quiet is not a choice left anymore.

And what better way to learn how to do that than from people who've had to face immense odds but yet have triumphed over them, turning what seemed to be debilitating handicaps into a means for their own growth and for helping others, too? I had the good fortune of meeting many such people recently, at the India Inclusion Summit 2015

We need environmental leaders to speak out for a new, just, and true-cost economy; and to challenge the mindless embracing of economic growth—even ruthless and futureless growth. Environmental leaders should be driving the push toward refocusing economic thinking on the changes that we will have to make if we are going to move to a healthier economy that exists within the nine planetary boundaries.

We have been out all day - on a typically touristy trajectory - starting the day with a trip up to Shankaracharya - the Moghul Gardens - nagin lake and finally the magical moments on a shikhara on Dal lake. We could not but be struck by the large numbers of tourists from every corner of India - and it was reassuring to mingle and speak with Telugu speakers, Bengalis and large numbers of Hindi and Punjabi speakers too. And there were Kashmiri families aplenty - enjoying picnic lunch with family and friends ......on the lawns of the ever enchanting Nishat, and Chashme Shahi gardens set against the towering Pir Panjal range - and the Zabarwan Mountains.

We shared our hopes that this would continue - knowing only too well that this could be a shortlived moment - empathising with the growing insecurities of our minorities - Muslims and Christians in particular.

Sure enough - we came home to see headlines screaming "" Curfew declared in select areas of Srinagar - as all the major groups call for a shut down in the valley to express their anguish, and anger and to protest the senseless killing of a young trucker accused of killing/ transporting cows. And on the same TV screens -we read of defiant Parivar members quoting the Vedas as providing sanction to killing those responsible/found guilty of cow slaughter..........

This is not my religion, not Hinduism, not the idea of india that we signed up for and which is the inclusive and syncretic heritage I inherited over thousands of years.....

September 26, 2015
 
WHO: The Alliance for Justice and Accountability (AJA) is an umbrella coalition of San Francisco Bay Area progressive organizations
 
WHAT: Protest to 'unwelcome' visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 
WHEN: Sunday, September 27, 2015
               Protests: 2:00 PM – 7:00 PM
               Suggested Media Presence: 3:30 PM
 
WHERE:

–        Bus routes: 22, 522, 63, 64, 65, 68, 181, Hwy 17 Express, MST 55, LRT, Caltrain, Capital Corridor
–        Free parking on Sunday in city parking structure north of Santa Clara Street, between 4th and 5th Streets
 
WHY:     
Modi was previously banned by successive US administrations from entering the United States, for his role in the 2002 Gujarat massacres, in which nearly 2,000 people were killed. With his Silicon Valley visit, Modi's supporters plan to hold a ""rock star"" reception aimed at rehabilitating his image as a pogrom-tainted politician.
 
AJA members will be sharing inconvenient facts about Modi's record that his PR team wants to hide — on the environment, religious rights, civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ equality, the safety of Dalit and adivasi communities, and beyond.
 
INTERVIEWS: Speakers and spokespersons of various organizations under AJA will be available to answer media questions.

But the courage to make such experiments on human beings is not shown even by the so-called modern scientist of today. If some human cross-breeding is seen today it is the result not of scientific experiments but of carnal lust. Now let us see the experiments our ancestors made in this sphere. In an effort to better the human species through cross-breeding the Namboodri Brahamanas of the North were settled in Kerala and a rule was laid down that the eldest son of a Namboodri family could marry only the daughter of Vaishya, Kashtriya or Shudra communities of Kerala. Another still more courageous rule was that the first off-spring of a married woman of any class must be fathered by a Namboodri Brahman and then she could beget children by her husband. Today this experiment will be called adultery but it was not so, as it was limited to the first child.""

But not in Athens – in Athens nobody gives a flying f…!

Many were still complaining bitterly about illegal immigration from Africa! Don't those writers who are now writing flattering essays, glorifying Greek people, know that? Or they pretend not to see and hear?

Greece is fighting for its own goals. Its incomes dropped, from 1.400 to 800 euros a month, per capita, in many cases. Terrible, but in many African nations where money to support Greek farmers often came from (by EU finishing African agriculture), incomes are sitting at around 30 euros per month. I tried to address these issues in Athens, but encountered stone faces and total bewilderment, even hostility. I was told: ""But we are used to different standards!""

And therefore I repeat: what is happening in Greece is not some left wing, internationalist revolution.

Greeks are fighting for Greece.

Latin America is fighting for humanity! It never exploited anybody. It sent doctors, teachers, all over the world. It sent oil to the poor, even in the United States. It supplied unfortunate countries like East Timor with trainers. It offered solidarity to Palestine, Iran, so many others!

Subject: Anti-Empire Report -- Taking a break 

Dear Comrades,
This is to inform you that starting immediately I'll be taking a break from sending out my monthly Anti-Empire Report. The reasons for this are as follows:
 
Burnt out: After more than a dozen years of putting out the report, because US foreign policy keeps repeating itself, with the same lies, I too often find myself repeating the same ideas I've expressed before, often in more or less the same words.

I also feel the effect of day after day, year after year,  intensively reading and seeing images of the human horrors; not just the horrors, but the lies and the stupidity.

Health: I'm 82, and I'm suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease, in its final stage.  The main symptom of this at present is rather serious fatigue.  I expect that within the next year or so I'll have to be on dialysis or receive a kidney transplant. 
 
 I hope that before too long I'll be able to submit an article to some of the Internet magazines.
 
 Keep ... the faith ... in touch ... on trucking,
     Bill

No bullet holes on trees, the clay mounds or on the ground. In the 'random' firing every single bullet seems to have found it's mark - the upper body of the victims.

Remembering Martin Niemöller's famous poem, I am tempted to think that if Martin had been an Indian—alive today—he would certainly have scribbled something like the following.

They first came to avenge the Love Jihad.
I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Muslim. 
Then they came for the Ghar Wapasi.
I didn't speak up because I wasn't Christian. 
Then they came for the saffronization of Sikhs. 
And I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Sikh.
Then they came for the de-Ambedkarization of Dalits,
And 'purification' of Adivasis in the caste culture.
And I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Dalit or Adivasi;
I didn't speak up because I was an OBC, an enslaved shudra. 
Then they came for the erasure of Phule and Periyar from textbooks.
But by that time all the 'minorities', 90 per cent of the population—
Muslims, Chritsians, Sikhs, Dalits, Adivasis, OBCs—
Were put in their ghettos, to serve the Hindu nation with its capital at Nagpur,
Allowing the real minority, less than 10 per cent of Indian population—
The racist-casteist-misogynist thugs, led by the Neanderthals of Nagpur,
Hiding behind the deceptive label of Hindu majority—
To fool and rule—and make mincemeat of—the masses.
The dhoti-clad Neanderthals of Nagpur, funded by the Corporate crooks,
Always invoke their Vedic-Puranic ancestors 
Who invented supersonic aeroplane before they made wheels,
And who concocted Caste, Untouchability and Varnashrama Dharma
To fool and rule and divide the humanity.

It had criticized the freedom movement as people from all the communities were part of It. RSS aims for Hindu nation, the way Muslim League's goal was Muslim nation. Today treading a careful path it wants to appropriate Gandhi for which a 'certificate' is needed from Gandhi. So his sentence is being manipulated to highlight 'hard disciplined work' and to hide the rider that 'so had been the 'Nazis of Hitler and Fascists of Mussolini.' The basic contradiction in the two types of nationalisms should guide us as what was Gandhi's attitude was towards RSS, despite the well manicured claims from RSS combine

Happy New Year to everyone on my timeline. I write this to you with sadness, and in agitation, but hoping that sharing this with the world will in some way make things easier for me and let me realize that I am not alone in this.
Dharmaraja Gunasekaran was the man I was married to (between September 2011 until I walked out on January 10, 2012 owing to domestic violence, abuse and marital rape). For those who are not already aware of the background of that story, the link below is my first person testimony. Please read it to get an idea of the man he is.
Dharmaraja has now gone ahead and managed to get FIR No. 822/2014 dated 30 December 2014 under Sections 147, 323 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code filed against my father Dr. Kandasamy. This FIR was filed in the Rajapalayam police station based on a complaint from Dharmaraja that my father along with 5 people beat him up on the 29th of December at 8.30 pm in Rajapalayam.
Now, to revisit the history of this last week. My partner/boyfriend Cédric Gégé arrived in India on the early morning hours of 28 December. Me, my dad and my sis picked him up from the airport. After GeGe caught up with his jet lag, the family spent the day together, hanging out having fun and so on. The next day, 29 December. as Madras was under the maddest rainfall ever, we stayed indoors the entire day until a friend of the family, came to visit us. We spent time together, and afterwards in the afternoon, I and GeGe went and visited Comrade Nallakannu along with our friend. We returned home at about 6 in the evening and we all had a family dinner: me, GeGe, my sis, my dad, my mom. We stayed up together, talking, catching up and so on. We ate the leftovers of a fish curry, my mother's special delicacy and called it a night. The next day I and GeGe had to catch the 6.20 Indigo flight to Kochi. So we had to get up super early and my dad called a driver for his car and he came with us and dropped us off at the airport in the wee hours, about 4 a.m. or so. He then went back home, and once we reached Kochi, I called my dad at 7.30 or so on the landline and told him that we were safely in Kochi and headed towards Fort Kochi where we are staying at present.
There is NO WAY in the world, unless someone was using a magic carpet, or had cloned himself, that my father could have been in Rajapalayam on the night of this completely imaginary incident. He has worked out and influenced the police to file an entirely fabricated case against my father and the motivation is clearly to hit back at me, victimize me further. I do not believe that the role of the state machinery in filing an FIR without even bothering about the whereabouts of my father is totally innocent either.
I do not know where this will end. This is not something that I imagined even in the worst of my dreams. Now, I wake up to the reality that the nightmare of an abusive marriage never ends. Now, I realize that if you are a political dissident, it becomes easy for psychopaths to utilize the corrupt state machinery to repress you in ways that you cannot even contemplate.
This is happening even as my case of domestic violence still lies pending in Chennai, a good two years after it was filed, with no recourse to justice for me. A few months ago, Dharmaraja even stopped attending court hearings and the case bundle mysteriously disappeared. On the other hand, he is able to pull the strings so cleverly that a case has been conjured out of thin air. This is the state of police in India. This is the extent to which a wife-beater can get away without any consequences even as he continues to wreak havoc to a woman he has already traumatized beyond repair.

The year saw the beginning of a new Cold War between the US and Russia over Ukraine; the birth of a new 'Islamic state' in Iraq and Syria; the brutal assault on Gaza by Israel; the exit of US troops from Afghanistan; a military coup in Thailand; the resurgence of the Tehrik-e-Taliban in Pakistan and the coming to power of the Hindu Taliban in India. Given these dismal trends, it is difficult to expect 2015 to be very different. And yet, since the term 'Happy' in 'Happy New Year' is only an expression of hope and not a statement of reality it is always to imagine a better world in the future
