""Today it seems Hollywood's primary mission, especially television, is to shove gayness into wherever it may fit. It's getting tired. Namely because it's being pushed by a tiny minority of militant gay activists in the gay community. I want to make this crystal clear. I'm not suggesting ALL gays are pushing for all gay characters in all TV shows or movies. I contend like with most issues in our political climate, the ""Gay Agenda"" in TV is being shoved by a fraction of a percent of the gay population. Their members of the Gaystapo. Small in numbers, shrill in voice. As stated before, the Gaystapo, and now the Hollywood Gay Agenda Pushers DO NOT represent millions of gay people who just want to live their lives in peace. Okay? Okay.

The thing is, there seems to be a gay storyline in every modern TV show out there. The one and only modern show I can think of without any uber-gay plot line? Breaking Bad. I've watched the show three times. Didn't see any gayness. But every other show I've seen? Somehow it always manages to slip in.

Am I saying gays should have no representation in television or movies? Of course not. But Hollywood knows it can shape pop culture and perceptions. Which is exactly what it is doing by portraying a disproportionate amount of characters as LGBTQAIP (silent F). Contrary to what you push on TV, homosexuals make up about 3.4 percent of the population, but make up 14 percent of films released in 2014. Yet they still complain about being under-represented. How the gayness is depicted I'll address later, but the result of vastly over-representing the gay population has led to...""

475549362567960_1110083409114549,"Sorry to burst this bubble, but no I'm not.

""A favorite tactic employed by leftists is to describe the Nazis as ""right wing,"" with Adolf Hitler, their leader, as the grand leader of this ""right wing"" movement. Rewriting history is pretty common for leftists, as their history is littered with injustice (the KKK was founded by Democrats, did you know?). Injustices they claim to fight against today. Awkward.

Adolf Hitler wasn't ""right wing."" If you take nothing else from this post, just remember Hitler was a socialist. With terrible facial hair. There's an easy way to remember it, too. NAZI stands for National Socialist German Workers' Party. Associate it with blunt mustaches.

What does National Socialist German Worker's Party mean? Glad you asked. Is it different from ""Democratic socialism""? Only in semantics. A Democracy is mob rule, which is why America is actually a constitutional, representative republic, NOT a democracy. A representative republic protects the minority from the majority, whereas a democracy is the rule of the majority.

Yep, glad I did it the right way.

We did it right.

Feeling judged? I couldn't care less. You know why? Because my wife and I were judged all throughout our relationship. People laughed, scoffed and poked fun at the young, celibate, naive Christian couple.
We'd certainly never make it to the wedding without schtupping, and if we did, our ""wedding night would be awkward and terrible,"" they said.
Turns out that people couldn't have been more wrong. Looking back, I think that the women saying those things felt like the floozies they ultimately were, and the men, with their fickle manhood tied to their pathetic sexual conquests, felt threatened.

I think it's important to write this column not to gloat (though I'll be glad to), but to speak up for all of the young couples that have also done things the right way. When people do marriage right, they don't complain so much, and so their voices are silenced by the rabble of promiscuous charlatans, peddling their pathetic world view as ""progressive.""

Our wedding was perfect. Our wedding night was nothing short of amazing. I write this on a plane heading into a tropical paradise with the most beautiful woman to have walked the planet earth. I know everybody says that their bride was the ""most beautiful in the world."" They're wrong. I win.

""Today it seems Hollywood's primary mission, especially television, is to shove gayness into wherever it may fit. It's getting tired. Namely because it's being pushed by a tiny minority of militant gay activists in the gay community. I want to make this crystal clear. I'm not suggesting ALL gays are pushing for all gay characters in all TV shows or movies. I contend like with most issues in our political climate, the ""Gay Agenda"" in TV is being shoved by a fraction of a percent of the gay population. Their members of the Gaystapo.

I've watched the show three times. Didn't see any gayness. But every other show I've seen? Somehow it always manages to slip in.

How the gayness is depicted I'll address later, but the result of vastly over-representing the gay population has led to the conclusion you aimed to draw. Most Americans believe the gay population is...""

Someone should tell Whirlpool about that. Have you noticed that in order for food to be prepared... you have to prepare it? Ridiculous. I'm calling my mom.
My fellow millennials, for sure we have our challenges. Many of you were raised in broken homes. Many of you were exposed to divorce.

But most of all, I'm sorry you were not instilled with the grand idea of personal responsibility. I'm sorry you were not empowered with the notion that YOU are the commander of your own life.

""Your sniveling cries of despondency is why Donald Trump is president-elect. That's right, you entitled babies: you're the reason a reality TV star is to be the Commander in Chief. So trot your flabby fat butts into the bathroom, look in the mirror, and scream at yourself. If you feel the need to more appropriately channel violence from people who had zero to do with Trump's election, and instead channel it toward those responsible? Raise your right hand. Make a fist. Punch yourself in the face. Repeat.

If at any time you find this letter too ""triggering"" or sophomoric, I invite you to retreat back to the safe space from which you oozed. Because based on your pissy attitudes of days past, your safe space is where you've been holed up for the past two or more years. Rocking back and forth while drooling. So please, skulk back to your dark hole you call home, light up a doobie (or whatever slang term you're using to describe pot), and stop destroying the property of your fellow Americans. Got it?

We had an election. Your pantsuited queen was defeated by an orange-haired television star who, eleven years ago, was caught on camera saying ""p*ssy."" It stings. I get it. I saw a war veteran and a governor defeated by a once junior senator from Illinois, who uttered empty promises read off a TelePrompter better than your mom wipes grease from your pimply face, using nothing but her spittle.

But channeling anger into the destruction of property, into the assault of those who supported an election's winner? That I have to explain its wrongness is why I believe you're better off being strapped into high chairs and fed with...""

One of the most ubiquitous among these, at least in the zip codes of our nation inhabited by cultural, political and economic elites, reads ""COEXIST.""

We hear a lot these days about coexistence and far less about assimilation. The gap between the two concepts represents nothing less than whether the United States is a salad bowl or a melting pot — a balkanized multiculturalist bastion, or one people united by a common creed.

Consider the European alternative that holds coexistence among the greatest of goods, allowing for mass immigration regardless of the people's desire to assimilate into their new surroundings ... and then see the politicians react helplessly to the predictable societal fallout.

In Germany, asylum seekers are refusing to do work, claiming that as ""guests of Angela Merkel"" they do not need to contribute, unlike their highly productive, industrious German neighbors. A recent report also out of Germany revealed that there were more than 1,000 known child marriages in one of the most advanced nations on the continent — a complete anathema to free Western society.

""You lost a priest today because of Islamic terrorism. Yes, I wrote ""Islamic terrorism"" without fear. Because what happened in Normandy, France was terrorizing. A priest was beheaded with a knife. Is there anything more evil, more gruesome or barbaric in this world? Well, apart from abortion? And it happened in a place of worship. This is what we're up against. I fear if we do not confront the true evil of our times, an evil our political classes would rather we not see, if we hide it behind pretty words with political buzz, we'll lose everything which we find most worthy of our love and admiration.

You are France: nation of culture, fine cuisine, art, and stereotypical snobbery (of which I'll be shamelessly referencing throughout this post, mocking out of affinity). Your nation used to be one of boundless pride. Now, rather than buttering your croissants and looking down your uncharacteristically large noses at the rest of the world (as you did with great aplomb), you've decided to trade in the berets for burkas. After so many centuries of France being the epicenter of all things fine, you threw in the towel. Only for it to be picked up and used to adorn a terrorist's skull. Or used to stem the bleeding from a disobedient Islamic wife. Little harlot probably deserved it. Showing ankle and what have you.

Yes, I realize that was a bit ""Islamophobic."" Not sorry.
Because if anyone should be feeling sorry? It's all of you sorry sacks who have to live in France. Sorry sacks not because you're French, but because your political leaders have left you defenseless.

475549362567960_926805770775648,"Top notch analysis from Daniel Horowitz

""The reason we are in this predicament today, irrespective of who wins this election (even if we did have a different GOP nominee) is because we spent the past few decades myopically focusing on the choice between the lesser of two evils. It began with Reagan's own VP choice he felt compelled to bring on in 1980, and the cycle of Bush/Clinton leading up to Obama cascaded from there. The GOP never stood for anything positive (aside for the aberration of the 1994 midterm elections) in a meaningful way. Sure, all of our presidential nominees sucked beyond belief and were often the very people who helped Democrats advance their agenda during their respective eras, but by golly, they were always better than the Democrat. I mean, after all, even Susan Collins or Lindsey Graham is better than Hillary Clinton in ideology and in character. 

Are they not?

Taken to its logical conclusion, there is never a time when it's not worth voting for the Republican, even when they legitimize and validate the Left's premise.  If Republicans are ok with codifying transgenderism into civil rights, well, one could always suspect the Democrat will be worse and support bestiality.  This is the attitude so many loyal conservatives – even more so than the moderates – have internalized throughout the eras of two Bushs, Dole, McCain, and Romney. Yet, history doesn't lie, and the Democrat success in moving the ball on every facet of fiscal and social policy since 1988 is nothing short of breathtaking. Rather than utilizing Reagan's ""new day – our sunlit new day – to keep alive the fire so that when we look back at the time of choosing, we can say that we did all that could be done – never less,"" all we did was focus on not electing Democrats.""
