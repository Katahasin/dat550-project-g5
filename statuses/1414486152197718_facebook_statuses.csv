I encouraged them to be bold and stand behind His Truth...in a loving way. And that it is important to encourage their congregations to stand with and for other followers of Jesus Christ.

""Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you, and please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house. For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon.""
- Genesis 40:14-15 -

The following is from Tony Evans' daily devotional. It is a great reminder of Who is in charge of our ""detours"" in life. Challenges come for all of us...how are you responding? Are you prepared to face them as Joseph was? 

From Tony Evans:
In Genesis, we read about how Joseph was forgotten and had to play the waiting game. Joseph was forced to languish in uncertainty for an extended period of time. But when his wait was over, Joseph was promoted beyond what he could have ever hoped or even dreamed. God not only made a way to provide Joseph his freedom again; God gave Joseph power, authority, significance and joy unlike any had ever experienced. God can do something similar with you if you will remain with Him in both heart and actions during your detours.

How do you know when you are getting close to exiting your detour and heading into your promotion? That would be when God does on your detour what you could never do on your own. During your detour you are trying to find you way to the main highway and simply trying to figure out what is going on. You are not able to get off the road you are traveling. God won't let you escape. But there finally comes a time when He shows you a sign—maybe it's a turn that opens up to the main highway, and you make it.

Often this is done through a way you had tried to do on your own before but were unsuccessful. Remember how Joseph tried to get the cupbearer to remember him? He asked him to remember him. He hoped he would remember him. But the cupbearer forgot him entirely. Only God did that precise thing a few years later. He caused the cupbearer to remember Joseph.

God is the One who is in control. Detours teach us this more than anything.
 

For His kingdom,

This morning, I received an email from the Heritage Foundations, Daily Signal. This commentary caught my attention and wanted to share it with you. Here are some nuggets that stood out to me:

The Obama administration claims 20 million more Americans today have health care due to Obamacare. The reality is that when you look at the actual net gains over the past two years since the program was fully implemented, the number is 14 million, and of that, 11.8 million (84 percent) were people given the ""gift"" of Medicaid.

And just because you may have one of those ""Medicaid cards"" doesn't mean your going to get treatment.

The most amazing part of this well written piece is the fact Maureen Dowd, a very liberal  columnist from the New York Times wrote it! (photo/Bing images)
 
Maureen Dowd 
Election Therapy From My Basket of Deplorables
 
The election was a complete repudiation of Barack Obama: his fantasy world of political correctness, the politicization of the Justice Department and the I.R.S., an out-of-control E.P.A., his neutering of the military, his nonsupport of the police and his fixation on things like transgender bathrooms. Since he became president, his party has lost 63 House seats, 10 Senate seats and 14 governorships.
 
The country had signaled strongly in the last two midterms that they were not happy. The Dems' answer was to give them more of the same from a person they did not like or trust.
 
Preaching — and pandering — with a message of inclusion, the Democrats have instead become a party where incivility and bad manners are taken for granted, rudeness is routine, religion is mocked and there is absolutely no respect for a differing opinion. This did not go down well in the Midwest, where Trump flipped three blue states and 44 electoral votes.
 
The rudeness reached its peak when Vice President-elect Mike Pence was booed by attendees of ""Hamilton"" and then pompously lectured by the cast. This may play well with the New York theater crowd but is considered boorish and unacceptable by those of us taught to respect the office of the president and vice president, if not the occupants.
 
Here is a short primer for the young protesters. If your preferred candidate loses, there is no need for mass hysteria, canceled midterms, safe spaces, crying rooms or group primal screams. You might understand this better if you had not received participation trophies, undeserved grades to protect your feelings or even if you had a proper understanding of civics. The Democrats are now crying that Hillary had more popular votes. That can be her participation trophy.
 
If any of my sons had told me they were too distraught over a national election to take an exam, I would have brought them home the next day, fearful of the instruction they were receiving. Not one of the top 50 colleges mandate one semester of Western Civilization. Maybe they should rethink that.
 
Mr. Trump received over 62 million votes, not all of them cast by homophobes, Islamaphobes, racists, sexists, misogynists or any other ""ists."" I would caution Trump deniers that all of the crying and whining is not good preparation for the coming storm. The liberal media, both print and electronic, has lost all credibility. I am reasonably sure that none of the mainstream print media had stories prepared for a Trump victory. I watched the networks and cable stations in their midnight meltdown — embodied by Rachel Maddow explaining to viewers that they were not having a ""terrible, terrible dream"" and that they had not died and ""gone to hell.""
 
The media's criticism of Trump's high-level picks as ""not diverse enough"" or ""too white and male"" — a day before he named two women and offered a cabinet position to an African-American — magnified this fact.
 
Here is a final word to my Democratic friends. The election is over. There will not be a do-over. So let me bid farewell to Al Sharpton, Ben Rhodes and the Clintons. Note to Cher, Barbra, Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham: Your plane is waiting. And to Jon Stewart, who talked about moving to another planet: Your spaceship is waiting. To Bruce Springsteen, Jay Z, Beyoncé and Katy Perry, thanks for the free concerts. And finally, to all the foreign countries that contributed to the Clinton Foundation, there will not be a payoff or a rebate.

Here is a quote directly from the study, ""When the internet is used as a medium for neighborhood social contact, such as a neighborhood email list or community forum (e.g., i-neighbors.org), participants tend to have very high levels of local engagement.   

60% of those who use an online neighborhood discussion forum know ""all or most"" of their neighbors, compared to 40% of Americans.
79% who use an online neighborhood discussion forum talk with neighbors in-person at least once a month, compared to 61% of the general population.
43% of those on a neighborhood discussion forum talk to neighbors on the telephone at least once a month, compared to the average of 25%.
70% on a neighborhood discussion forum listened to a neighbor's problems in the previous six months, and 63% received similar support from neighbors, compared to 49% who gave and 36% who received this support in the general population.""

From Country Living

After serving in the Air Force and injuring both his knees, Clay Luthy had trouble finding work when he got back home. The one main reason: Charlotte, a 10-year-old golden retriever who was by his side constantly as a service dog. But according to KRBC, the two of them now help customers-and provide some much-needed comfort-at a Lowe's store in Abilene, Texas.

Luthy was getting a few handyman jobs here and there, but wanted to see if Lowe's would hire him. He had an interview and made sure the manager knew that Charlotte was part of the deal. He was hired for a part-time job, and he even made a special work uniform vest for Charlotte. The vest lets customers know that while she's at Lowe's, they can pet her; most other times it's inappropriate to pet service dogs.

""We went through the interview process and Clay and his own merit won the job,"" Jay Fellers, a human resources manager, told KIDY. ""And we knew he was gonna make a great employee – we just got the benefit of getting Charlotte right along with him.""

According to the Abilene Reporter-News, Charlotte's main job is to help Luthy back up if his knees go out. But she also helps ease his anxiety when he's out and about. And at Lowe's, she's there to cheer customers up and distract ornery kids while their parents go shopping.

Luthy and Charlotte have been working at Lowe's for two months, and the pair is an online hit. A customer's photo of the two working together went viral on Facebook over the weekend.

But Charlotte, at 10, is looking to retire soon. Luthy is training Lola, a golden retriever puppy at home, to take over the job at Lowe's, and Charlotte will eventually move on to comfort people at hospitals and nursing homes.

This isn't even the first time that Lowe's has brought a service dog onto a team.

It's an amazing read on how we can learn to be effective cultural warriors. Indeed, we live in dangerous times and often feel overwhelmed and alone. This book is a good reminder that we aren't alone and provides support for how to push back. It's an excellent Daily Devotional! 

For example...Dr. Hawkins writes on these three timeless truths: 
* Don't give in. Be Resistant
* Don't give up. Be Consistent
* Don't give out. Be Persistent

This week in Houston, I had business meetings and a chance to spend the night at my daughter and son-in-laws house, too. After dinner, we were sitting around and pulled out some old boxes of memorabilia and articles from my football days. 

Of all the articles and memories we looked over that night...seeing my grandmothers picture was the highlight of the evening for me. I had no idea she'd been interviewed....I'd never seen this article. 

Family means so much to me. Remembering who you are and where you come from is important. My grandmother was a nurse at the State Hospital in Rusk, Texas for 25 years. After her husband died (papa James)....she stayed on the farm for many years by herself (Alto,TX). Eventually, she moved down the road to a bigger town, Lufkin...where she spent her final years. Mama was awesome and had a great laugh. She and her friends would stay up all night playing dominos!! Haha...I can only imagine the stories they'd tell while playing dominos. 

I'm thankful for the support and love Mama Boyd provided me. Mama loved Jesus Christ...and we all knew it.

As with other small business owners and individuals...we have to REPEAL OBAMACARE! It's not good for Republicans or Democrats. The Healthcare Industry needs massive reform. I've copied and attached Trump's plan for addressing this issue. The information below is from his website. 

THIS PROMISE TO REPEAL HAS TO BE EXTREMELY HIGH ON HIS PRIORITY LIST. I'll be praying for his wisdom and those around him who are advising. 

*From Trump's website:
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must:

Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.
Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up.
Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn't Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.
Allow individuals to use Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Contributions into HSAs should be tax-free and should be allowed to accumulate. These accounts would become part of the estate of the individual and could be passed on to heirs without fear of any death penalty. These plans should be particularly attractive to young people who are healthy and can afford high-deductible insurance plans. These funds can be used by any member of a family without penalty. The flexibility and security provided by HSAs will be of great benefit to all who participate.
Require price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and healthcare organizations like clinics and hospitals. Individuals should be able to shop to find the best prices for procedures, exams or any other medical-related procedure.
Block-grant Medicaid to the states. Nearly every state already offers benefits beyond what is required in the current Medicaid structure. The state governments know their people best and can manage the administration of Medicaid far better without federal overhead. States will have the incentives to seek out and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources.
Remove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products. Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America. Though the pharmaceutical industry is in the private sector, drug companies provide a public service. Allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.
The reforms outlined above will lower healthcare costs for all Americans. They are simply a place to start. There are other reforms that might be considered if they serve to lower costs, remove uncertainty and provide financial security for all Americans. And we must also take actions in other policy areas to lower healthcare costs and burdens. Enforcing immigration laws, eliminating fraud and waste and energizing our economy will relieve the economic pressures felt by every American. It is the moral responsibility of a nation's government to do what is best for the people and what is in the interest of securing the future of the nation.

Providing healthcare to illegal immigrants costs us some $11 billion annually. If we were to simply enforce the current immigration laws and restrict the unbridled granting of visas to this country, we could relieve healthcare cost pressures on state and local governments.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/CraigJames32/photos/a.1591690197810645.1073741828.1414486152197718/1686688198310844/?type=3,2016-11-10 09:55:46,492,32,93,466,11,6,1,2,6

In 1955, my grandfather purchased this Farmall Super C tractor for his farm. As a little boy...I first sat on my dad's lap and took rides. Then, I learned how to cut hay, rake and bale it, too.

Years ago, my four kids each took their first tractor ride on this Farmall. They became 4th generation James' to ride on it. This Thanksgiving...when our family gets togther, my grandson will become the 5th generation James member to begin their tractor experiences on it, too.

Chemistry and talented players with a great system equal hard to beat. However, A&M is the real deal, too. They've found chemistry that's been missing since Johnny Manziel stole it. The Aggies are physical enough to play with Alabama. That's the first thing a team must have to stay on the field with Alabama. The Aggies will try to run against a great rush defense...but it'll be qb Trevor Knight's running and play action that will force Bama to stay balanced. The Aggies had a week off to prepare while Bama was on the road demolishing Tennessee. 
Pick: I'm pulling for the Ags ( my daughter's an Ag and will be watching with me ) but don't think they can go to Bama and win.

I'm hearing they are trying to extend AGAIN...his current contract to keep him in Houston. The no-decision by the Big 12 to stay at 10 teams hurt the Cougars chances of keeping Herman. If they'd been invited to the Big 12, I'm not sure Herman would have looked any other place. Houston's got a lot of momentum, with good facilities and love their coach. Having said that, if Texas opens up...they'll be hard to turn down. Great history and can pay buckets of money, too. With Herman's current stand in Texas high school football...he'd be an immediate impact coach on the recruiting trail. 

* Indianapolis Colts qb Andrew Luck...what's up? The Colts gave Luck a huge contract last year ( 5 yrs-122 million-ish) and I still wonder why. Sure he's a talented player. But has he ever won a championship? At any level? Not high school...not college...not in the NFL. At some point in time, will we look back at Luck in the same way we look at Cowboys qb Tony Romo? Great numbers, stats, etc., but no championships. QB's are measured by the number of championships they win. It is what it is...

The more I study God's Word and the more we see our world turning away from Him, the more striking the following scripture is to me:

""""Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.""
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭7:13-14‬ ‭NASB‬‬

For those who want to push-back and contest this verse...remember, it's what God said. It's not my saying...not a preachers...not a man/woman on the street. 

Who knows what the ""gate"" will look like as we enter eternity with our Lord and Savior. What's important is to KNOW you'll be one of those who enters the gate ""that leads to life..."". 

How about you? Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior? John 14:6: ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" NIV

Some of the discomfort these singers have comes from the author of the anthem...Francis Scott Key, being a slave owner. 

Alicia Keys had this to say: ""To actually read the facts, you know, I can understand it. It's time for a lot of things to change. We know what this country was built off of and based off of, and it's time for that to evolve. It's time for the story to evolve,"" she said.

Keys isn't alone, singer John Legend called the anthem ""weak,"" opting for ""America the Beautiful"" instead.

In a story by the Associated Press: A Quinnipiac University poll released this week shows that most white Americans disapprove of protests by athletes during the national anthem while black Americans approve of the protests by an even larger margin.

* The LA Rams are feeding off of the energy of living/playing in California. They have a stud defense! Coach Jeff Fisher's work in getting his team ready for the season is amazing...despite the monumental task of moving cities
* Proving my old saying accurate are the Arizona Cardinals and Carolina Panthers. Everyone in the NFL is good or they wouldn't be there. The NFL is a game played between the ears...the team who prepares well and without distractions has a good chance of winning. Hard to believe these two teams are 1-3. 
* How 'bout them Cowboys! Rookies Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott are pumping energy into the players around them. The Cowboys offensive line is the strength of the team. Even future Hall of Famer Jason Witten looks like he's playing ""younger"". An inspired defense rises to the occassion when needed. 
* I love what coach Jack Del Rio and the Oakland Raiders are doing!! The NFL is better when teams like Dallas, Pittsburgh and Oakland are doing well. QB Derek Carr and WR Michael Crabtree had a good weekend...with Crabtree catching 3 td's. 
* The Indianapolis Colts gave all that money to qb Andrew Luck and expected more than a 1-3 record. At some point in time...will Luck ever prove he's more than an average qb? There's more to quarterbacking than just having nice stats...gotta win games. 
* Further proof that every team is talented...the Atlanta Falcons are on fire! Led by a veteran qb, Matt Ryan and phenom receiver, Julio Jones. Jones had 300 yards receiving!!! The Falcons smashed defending NFC Champions Carolina and are now 3-1.
* Gotta mention my old team, the Patriots. They end up going 3-1 without Tom Brady and are maybe the only ones disappointed in that record. Heck, they all figured they'd be 4-0 during the Brady-less suspension. Now, all the stars are lined back up in New England as Brady returns to action. The Pats are the team to beat in the AFC!

Right on to the King of Rock and Roll! 

A couple of years ago, I was hosting a national radio show. We had a segment that we opened up for callers to ask questions. This young caller asked me for help on a problem he was having in life. The caller informed me he was having a problem with sexual addiction and so was his girlfriend. They were into kinky sex that included multiple partners. The caller wanted to know how he could overcome his problem. 

I told the young man he needed to become addicted to God! He needed to replace the pornographic world he was feeding to his mind…with God's Word. I have no idea what the young man decided to do with his life. But he was a great example of what Dr. Hannah was referring to. 

How about you? I see many who are always chasing happiness with ""stuff"". Twenty years ago, a man bragged to me about his sign that read: he who dies with the most wins! Seriously…this guy really believed that. Many others do, too, but don't recognize or flaunt their thoughts. They just go about life aquiring and looking for the next ""deal"". 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a boring guy who just sits around doing nothing. I have fun with life, sometimes too much fun. On a daily basis, I try to avoid the ""stuff"" that life throws my way. 

My defense comes from keeping my eyes focused on God…entertaining my mind with His Word. 

Several years ago, Matthew 6:33 really hit home to me.

While having dinner this week with an old buddy....the topic came to spirituality/religion. I could tell my friend wanted to hear my thoughts on God...on religion...on spirituality. 

My answer was short and to the point: It's all about Jesus. 

First and foremost each of us must decide if we are going to follow Jesus. Following Jesus means accepting Him as our savior...asking for forgiveness of our sins and turning from our old ways. 

My goal when sharing the Good News: make sure I don't complicate or confuse the person I'm visiting with. I had a football coach who once taught us the KISS principle: Keep It Simple Stupid. My coach wanted to make sure we heard what he was saying. 

People searching for answers about God aren't looking for an intellectual wizard who can pontificate verse after verse. I've found they are looking for a caring heart and a simple understanding of what it takes to become a follower of Jesus.  

Once a person accepts Jesus...the power of the Holy Spirit goes to work. Then, the day to day walk with Jesus is in full swing and a personal relationship is underway. 

Have a great weekend.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/CraigJames32/photos/a.1591690197810645.1073741828.1414486152197718/1658385417807789/?type=3,2016-09-16 08:55:08,863,71,308,806,53,3,1,0,0

Here's the news: the NCAA has moved 7 championships from the state of North Carolina...which includes NCAA basketball tournament games, for the 2016-17 year. Why? Because of the state's controversial law that says a person has to use the restroom of their gender at birth. The law is House Bill 2/HB2. 

NCAA President Mark Emmert said the decision was a 'proverbial no-brainer."" Really? 

Once again, the LGBT community wins. Why? Because they are vocal and fight hard for what they believe in. The state of North Carolina's elected officials passed a law they believe their constituents support. Polling numbers offer support for both sides. Because of this law, citizens are going to miss out on several sporting events they care a lot about. And there's a lot of revenue that businesses will lose out on, too. 

Where's the push-back? How can North Carolina fight back? Apparently, convention business is down in the state and several big corporations are against HB2. 

Are there that many Americans who've thrown in the towel and don't really care to fight against social issues?

Tony Romo can't stay healthy and on the field. This isn't my opinion...it is a factual observation. During last nights preseason game vs the Seattle Seahawks, Romo was hurt on the games 3rd play and had to leave the game. He did not return. ( photo AP ) 

Romo has a list of injuries he's dealt with over the last several seasons. He's 36 years old and well beyond his primetime playing days. There's no debating the statistical numbers of Romo's career. When healthy, he's put up good numbers. What would be debatable...is his lack of success in the postseason and no championships. 

After Romo left the game last night, rookie qb Dak Prescott entered and continued to build on his extraordinary preseason play. In my opinion, Prescott has been the biggest storyline throughtout the NFL this preseason with his exemplary play. There's no way the Cowboys could have imagined the kind of poise, leadership, accuracy and success that Prescott is having this early in his career. 

History will tell us that...statistically, rookie qb's struggle during the regular season. But not all rookie qb's have ever had the luxury of playing behind a great offensive line, more than capable wide receivers led by Dez Bryant and a stable full of really good running backs, either. 

My thought about using Romo as a backup isn't unique. For support, look no further than last years Super Bowl Champs, Denver Broncos. Peyton Manning was having health issues during the middle of the season. So the Broncos turned to backup qb, Brock Osweiler. Osweiler responded well...leading the team on a 5-2 run. In the last game of the season...Manning returned to lead the Broncos on to the eventual Super Bowl title. The Broncos won because of a great defense. 

The Cowboys of 2016 will win behind a great offensive line! Put Prescott in as the starter and let him go....if and when he struggles, bring in Romo to save the day.

The make-believe character was also used to explain terms like questioning, queer, cis gender, non-binary, genderqueer and gender nonconforming. The workshop, titled ""Transgender 101,"" helped teachers learn to ""define and use important terms and concepts related to gender identity and identify issues facing transgender and gender expansive students.""

To close and to be certain with my beliefs on immigration...we have laws that must be obeyed. There is a way to enter America...legally. I am for immigration reform and against open borders. I am for giving immigrants from around the world a chance to come to America and live the American Dream. There is too much at stake with all of the insanity going on around the world to leave our borders open...

The Republican and Democratic Conventions are meant to energize and mobilize their voters to turn out and vote for their candidate. 

My fellow Republicans...my coach for the New England Patriots, Raymond Berry...loved to say: never underestimate the enemy! 
In this case, as a Republican...I respect the efforts being made by the Democrats and will do all I can to help my party win in November. 

Why? Because I believe the Constitution, limited government, lower taxes and religious liberty/freedom of speech provides the best chance for ALL who live here now and for those who will come to have a chance at living the American Dream.

In church yesterday, pastor Chris Kouba put a biblical lens on the divisiveness and suffering our country is facing. 

It was a GREAT message and reminder that modern man isn't the only one who has ever faced suffering. 

Dr. Kouba provided 6 points: 

1) Jesus knows about suffering: ""But we see Jesus...because he suffered death..."" Hebrews 2:9
2) Jesus knows about justice: ""Do not take revenge...It is mine to avenge; I will repay..."" Romans 12:19
3) Jesus knows about racial tension: Jesus tells the Parable of the Good Samaritan. Jesus used Jews and Samaritan's as the example because they did not like each other. Yet, ""love your neighbor as yourself""...""Go and do likewise"". Luke 10: 25-37
4) Jesus knows about being wrongfully treated: ""Christ suffered for you..He committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth...he did not retaliate; when he suffered...he made no threats...Instead...he entrusted himself to him who judges justly."" 1 Peter 2:21-23
5) Jesus knows about loss: Remember when Jesus comforted Mary and Martha regarding Lazarus' death? ""Jesus wept"" John 11:35
6) Jesus knows about heaven: ""But our citizenship is in heaven"" Philippians 3:20-21. 

There are raging emotions on so many fronts that it's hard to isolate any particular one matter to choose. Yet, as I consider each from a biblical perspective, I'm reminded that God is in control and fully aware of our situations.

To be certain of what it means....I've copied a portion of the definition from Wikipedia for your study.

From Wikipedia: 
The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials.

I take particular interest in ""law should govern a nation"" and ""constraint upon behavior...of government officials"". 

As for me, America has taken back-to-back blows these last two days regarding the rule of law.

America is about to ""tolerate"" herself out of greatness. 

In Galatians, Paul wrote to Christians to call them to their faith and freedom in Christ. At the time of writing, Judaizers were telling Christians in order to be saved they had to follow the Jewish law. Here's what Paul wrote to them that is also relevant for us today: ""Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ."" Galatians 1:10, NIV. 

We've got to stop trying to please the world...instead, we should strive to honor and please God.

1414486152197718_1604186029894395,"In 1986, I was honored to play in the Pro Bowl. It was my second year in the NFL and I was like a kid in a candy store. I'll never forget walking into the locker room for practice and seeing Marcus Allen, Dan Fouts, Mike Webster, Steve Largent, etc., and thinking ""wow"". 

As always, Hawaii was beautiful and didn't disappoint. 

But then we had to play the game! Ugh! I'd just come off a blow-out loss in Super Bowl XX to the Chicago Bears and was exhausted. While an honor to be there...it was a challenge to gear up and play the game the way I'd always played it. 

So, for me...the idea of it now going to Orlando is a last gasp effort to save the event. Orlando is a wonderful place! This has nothing to do with it going to Orlando. It has everything to do with the fact players want to be chosen for the game but don't want to play in it.

They should continue to honor those players who've had a great season and name them to a Pro Bowl roster. Instead of playing a game...think of something unique for these players to do. 

Here's a crazy thought to ponder. Since the NFL is thinking about global expansion...why not reward the players and their families with a trip to a warm destination spot and do charitable/mission work? These players/coaches/families could raise a lot of money and do good for any number of things/people. 

Instead of a football game...have a variety of events. Volleyball, softball, horseshoes, croquet, polo...you get the idea. I'd love to see these athletes out of their element and competing with each other in a variety of challenges.

Donald Trump has to start talking about policy! His :30 second canned responses to border security and bad trade deals won't beat Hillary Clinton. 

In her victory speech tonight, Hillary Clinton spoke at length about her policy positions...all of which I disagree with. Yet, she spoke with conviction and left no doubt about her desire/will to achieve her idea's. The Democrats are getting locked and loaded for the General election in November. 

Trump spent 99% of his time talking about anything/everything BUT his policy idea's. It was all about how he's won here and there and the system is rigged, etc. If you don't believe me, take the time to listen to both of their speeches. 

Bottom line: 

* Trump is who the Republican Party voters want
* The Republican Party and Trump have got to come together
* Ted Cruz and John Kasich need to get out of the race so the Republican Party can begin to unite/rally around Trump 
* Without Cruz/Kasich, Trump can focus on a VP candidate and policy matters

I've attached his combine workouts to you can see his body and athleticism at work.

I'm scratching my head over this trade the New England Patriots made for Chicago Bears TE, Martellus Bennett. Not because Bennett isn't good...but because he's not as good as THE MAN, THE GRONK...Rob Gronkowski, who's already playing TE in New England. 

I'm talking about locker room harmony! 

Can Bennett's ego ( and we know he has a big one ) accept that he's not as good and popular as Rob Gronkowski? I've already read a quote from Bennett saying he looks forward to learning from Gronk...and that he's sure there are some things Gronk will learn from him. Maybe...but my guess is the first freeze in the coming fall will occur before Gronk breaks out the pen and paper taking notes from Bennett's play. If ever....

In terms of game strategy, this is a big deal for the Pats. I think it's the biggest deal in the NFL this offseason. Why? Because Tom Brady will now have another significant talent in Bennett to take pressure off of Gronk in the passing game. Therefore, in my mind...New England once again will be a top favorite for the Super Bowl. 

Bill Belichick is masterful at getting guys to play ""The Patriots Way"". To me...it's been about teamwork and team effort in New England. Belichick's shown many good players the ""high-way"" and their walking papers if they don't buy into his concept. 

My prediction: Brady will make sure Bennett gets enough touches each game to stay happy.

1414486152197718_1567158730263792,"First of all, this notes intentions aren't meant to get your vote for Ted Cruz. Rather, it is to add balance to the slander being aimed at Senator Cruz as to why others in the senate aren't endorsing him for President. 

In 2012, I ran for the U.S. Senate seat in Texas vs Ted. We spent a lot of time traveling the state and campaigning against each other. In the end, it was a resounding loss for me and the beginning for Ted's political career. Over the years, we've stayed in touch and become good friends. 

There is no doubt in my mind about Ted's love for his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ! He loves his wife and daughters, too. I've heard Ted's testimony when it was just the two of us...after all the folks had left the event. There were no camera's, writers or press around. It was just two men sharing their deeply held convictions.   

For six months, I campaigned against Ted and heard him say how he'd go to Washington to ""kick the bushes"" and truly represent ALL Texans. What has Ted done in D.C.? He's kicked the bushes and not ""joined"" the good-ol-boys network ( the establishment ). As promised, Ted has represented ALL Texans. His overwhelming victory on Super Tuesday in Texas was confirmation as to him keeping his word with Texans as we thanked him for his work.

If Ted does become the President...I have no doubt about the following things happening: ISIS's days are numbered, the Constitution will be honored, Rule of Law will be respected, Obama Care is gone, a conservative justice will be appointed for the Supreme Court and our borders will be secured. 

How do I know this? Because he's done as he said he'd do in Washington. Needless to say, this hasn't set particularly well with the Establishment or many of his colleagues in the senate chamber. 

Again, please keep in mind the spirit for which this letter was written. My goal was to offer another viewpoint as to why other senators have not endorsed Ted for President. I don't care who you vote for...as long as you vote. It's a privilege we have in America. We need Republicans and Democrats involved and educated on who to vote for. God Bless!
