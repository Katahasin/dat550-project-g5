372907709740736_384993421865498,"What is ThePopulist.Buzz?

ThePopulist.Buzz is a publication founded in 2017 by Bob Dreyfuss and Max B. Sawicky devoted to reporting on and analyzing post-2016 efforts to rethink and rebuild the Democratic party.

It is a platform for original opinion and news analysis, including op-eds, longer commentaries, and a blog. Content will be provided by its founders, along with featured pieces by contributing writers, guest commentators, and national and local reporters.

We believe that only a reconstituted Democratic party, built around a progressive, populist platform and with a reinvigorated grassroots base, can credibly confront the dangers posed by the Donald Trump administration and its far-right supporters.

ThePopulist.Buzz will take sides in the debate about the future of the Democratic party. We will urge the party to promote and expand populist economic policies and to elevate class in the party's programmatic focus.

We do not want Democrats to reduce, much less abandon our commitment to the rights of minorities, women, immigrants, and all gender identities. We see the causes of voting rights and environmental justice as strategic priorities. In the sterile and ultimately fruitless back-and-forth about whether ""identity politics"" or ""the working class"" should have primacy, we argue: the Democrats can't have one without the other. We equally reject efforts to discount class, race, or gender.

Fixing what's wrong with the Democratic party means starting with the hard truth that the Democratic Party establishment is too closely tied to, and dominated by, affluent elites – yes, that infamous 1 percent – who discount class and who have at best a tenuous commitment to progressive priorities in the areas of race and gender. 

For decades, the elitists within the Republican Party, aligned with Wall Street, the corporate world, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have relied on Christian evangelical conservatives and members of the National Rifle Association, among others, to build its voting base. However, in the same manner, the Democratic Party's elitists have cynically trumpeted their own shallow version of identity politics in an effort to lock up African-American, Hispanic, and women voters – without, however, putting front and center the real, bread-and-butter issues that must be tackled in order to bring about material improvement in the day-to-day lives of those selfsame voters.

Thus, in 2016, running a national campaign against a vile, potty-mouthed billionaire who lives on Fifth Avenue, the Democratic party and its presidential standard-bearer found itself utterly incapable of mounting a populist, progressive challenge to the GOP. We associate ThePopulist.Buzz unambiguously with oppositional currents typified by the Bernie Sanders campaign, leaders such as Elizabeth Warren and Keith Ellison, grassroots movements such as Black Lives Matter, and the spirit embodied by Occupy Wall Street. Not only must the Democratic party's platform, program, policies, and legislative agenda be radically altered, so must its leadership, from top to bottom: inside the Democratic National Committee, in its electoral organs, and with new, progressive candidates in local, statewide and federal elections.

The task now for the Democratic party, its supporters, and progressives is to integrate a full-throated defense of civil, voting, and women's rights with economic populism.

There's no mystery about why many white, working class voters – especially in the Christian-evangelical south and in rural and exurban areas – have increasingly moved into the Republican column. It's a process that began in the 1960s, when the Democratic party courageously supported the civil rights movement, and southern, segregationist Democrats abandoned the party en masse. That movement, which also expressed itself in southern support for George Wallace's presidential campaigns, was consolidated by Richard Nixon's ""Southern strategy."" It expanded during the culture wars launched by Ronald Reagan, the Moral Majority, and the Christian Coalition. It took concrete form with the emergence of the Tea Party, heavily supported by the Koch Brothers, the Heritage Foundation, and others. With each successive election, despite periodic ups and downs, more and more white voters, especially in lower- and middle-income brackets, voted GOP.

At the same time, during the past half-century, the Democratic party has increasingly allowed itself to be captured by corporate funders, the affluent elites on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, the health insurance industry, and more. As the GOP has moved rightward, the Democrats have drifted toward the right, too – thanks in part to Bill and Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Leadership Council. The emergence of big funders and political action committees since the 1970s, the rapid expansion of Washington's lobbying class in the 1980s, the decline of organized labor and the AFL-CIO, and the virtual elimination of regulations governing political spending and money-in-politics controls – especially since the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United – all combined to neuter the Democratic party as a true representative of the poor, the working class, and the middle class.

That must change.

Not every white voter who supported Donald Trump in 2016 did so because of Trump's overt appeals to white nationalism. Some of them, unfortunately, did. Others, however – more than enough, by far, to have tilted the presidential, Senate and House races toward the Democrats had they voted otherwise – voted for Trump because of his false-Messiah promises to create jobs, to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, to end bad trade deals. In 2008 and in 2012, many of these voters supported Barack Obama because they believed in his hope-and-change mantra; in 2016, to these voters, Donald Trump seemed to be the candidate of hope and change. 

And Hillary Clinton, and the Democrats, didn't.

Bernie Sanders, an independent, democratic socialist – who, it must be noted, is not a member of the Democratic party – shocked the political establishment by nearly toppling the Clinton machine. We don't argue that Sanders, had he been the Democratic nominee, would have won: who knows? But we do argue that the upsurge that powered the campaign of an unlikely, aged, white-haired Vermont socialist is a sign that many American voters are ready for a left-populist message.

The unique role of ThePopulist.Buzz will be to provide curated, incisive discussion of the Democratic party and its allies, including both left-leaning and liberal groups, without itself having formal ties to any faction or interest group, elected officials, activist organizations, or publications. 

ThePopulist.Buzz will be a platform for opinion and news analysis on current events, a switchboard, regularly updated, with links to select pieces published elsewhere that are congruent with the mission, a blog, a roster of groups, organizations and media sites active in and around the progressive wing of the Democratic party, and a regularly updated program around which we believe the party ought to center its rebuilding effort.
 
At ThePopulist.Buzz, we believe that, despite its flaws, the Democratic party can and should be the primary vehicle for promoting progressive politics in the United States. We do not believe that third parties and splinter groups, no matter how well intentioned, can succeed. But we do believe that an organized progressive faction or caucus within the Democratic party, one that runs candidates for local, state and federal elections – including in primary elections – can play a critical in moving the party forward.
 
ThePopulist.Buzz intends to cover the internal politics of the Democratic party, its various organs (including the Democratic National Committee), and its programs; the plans and preparations for the 2018 and 2020 electoral cycles, including especially the emergence and prospects for progressive candidates in those elections; the activities of leading progressive spokespeople such as Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and others; the work of outside progressive groups, including unions; and the work of national and local campaigns such as those concerning a $15 minimum wage, single-payer health care, criminal justice and police reform, and climate change.
