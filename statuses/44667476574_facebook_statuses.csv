Aronoff lays out the existential threat posed by the Trump administration, and how the climate movement is rising to meet the challenge—both by resisting Trump and recruiting progressive, climate-focused politicians willing to take bold action.

The issue also features a story by Aronoff on the fast-growing grassroots group Indivisible, which is putting pressure on both Republicans and Democrats in congress by enlisting regular citizens across the country to demand progressive change. 

Aronoff is also a regular contributor to Rolling Stone, the Guardian and Jacobin, and a co-host of the Dissent magazine podcast Hot & Bothered. She will be in town from New York City. 

Also joining us will be Toby Chow, Chair of the People's Lobby. 

The People's Lobby is a membership-driven organization that organizes to support policies and candidates that ""put the needs of people and the planet before the interests of big corporations and the very rich.""

Aronoff and Chow will be in discussion with In These Times community editor Miles Kampf-Lassin. More guests TBA. 

Doors open at 6, and the program will begin at 7.

Other highlights from the issue include: 

—Theo Anderson on how cities are rebelling against Trump and GOP-dominated state legislatures.

—An investigation by Alex Kane into a U.S. nonprofit that is funding guards at illegal Israeli settlements. 

In These Times, an independent, nonprofit magazine, is dedicated to advancing democracy and economic justice, informing movements for a more humane world, and providing an accessible forum for debate about the policies that shape our future.

Of course, were he alive, Douglass would likely be resisting Trump's agenda every step of the way, guided by his pivotal words:

""The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims, have been born of earnest struggle. The conflict has been exciting, agitating, all-absorbing, and for the time being, putting all other tumults to silence. It must do this or it does nothing. If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunder and lightening. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters."" 

This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/inthesetimesmag/photos/a.10150090612471575.283872.44667476574/10154978593706575/?type=3,2017-02-01 15:27:03,391,12,205,318,61,1,9,2,0

44667476574_10154832071451575,"Why we need journalism that stands up to power:

The next four years are shaping up to be a historic challenge for independent media. We are facing a president who has expressed his intention to criminalize dissent and crack down on freedom of the press. But even in these dark times, we should remember: Journalism still has the potential to stand up to power.

Whether it's reporting on the Watergate scandal that helped unseat a president (who was also hostile to the press), the uncovering of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam that transformed perception of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia, or, more recently, reporting that In These Times contributed to that helped expose the corporate behemoth known as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and led to mass divestment by member companies -- time and again investigative journalism has proven that it is capable of changing the world for the better.

That is why investigative journalism is a key tenet of our mission at In These Times -- and why we invest so heavily in producing it.

This year we sent reporters across the globe to uncover injustices and expose wrongdoing by governments and corporations alike. This kind of work isn't easy -- or cheap -- but we know that it is vital to serving the public good and protecting the rights of working people the world over.

If you believe in the importance of this type of hard-hitting independent journalism, please make a tax-deductible donation to In These Times today:

Just this week, we published a major 6-month investigation into Louisiana's Angola prison -- the largest maximum-security state prison in the country -- revealing horrendous healthcare practices that lead to death rates that dwarf the national average. A class action lawsuit alleges that this treatment amounts to unconstitutional ""cruel and unusual punishment.""

This is exactly the kind of journalism that we have staked our reputation on -- uncompromising, long-term reporting that exposes how powerful systems are hurting society's most marginalized.

And it is the kind of reporting that can make a real impact in people's lives -- already the story is being cited by prison advocacy organizations and legal rights groups in their work to bring justice to prisoners.

In 2016, we published other investigative stories that included:

—A blockbuster investigation highlighting that Native Americans are killed by police at a higher rate than any other group in the country -- and are 3 times more likely to be killed by police than white Americans. Our reporter, Stephanie Woodard, spent months interviewing family members of Natives killed by police and told their stories in-depth, laying bare the discrepancies in the police accounts.

—A revealing look into the world's ""special economic zones"" that found paradises for corporations and wastelands for human rights. Our reporters, Matt Kennard and Claire Provost, gained access to SEZs in Cambodia and Shenzhen, China, where they interviewed dozens of workers who detailed rampant labor abuses and intense crackdowns on attempts to organize.

—An exclusive exposé revealing the undemocratic origins of the use of superdelegates in the Democratic presidential primary.

Our reporter, Branko Marcetic, went to the National Archives and dug up never before published transcripts of the 1981-1982 Hunt Commission, which led to the creation of superdelegates. His reporting revealed once and for all the uncensored reasoning behind the superdelegate system: To prevent primary voters from choosing ""outsider"" candidates by reducing the role of voters in choosing the nominee.

—A major report revealing how the U.S. government helps corporations plunder Native lands. Stephanie Woodard's months-long investigation showed a clear pattern of allowing corporations to pressure Natives into signing away their land for drilling, fracking and other resource extraction, for little in return.

These are just some of the investigations In These Times has published this year alone.

We are proud to make this reporting possible, and we know that it will become ever more important under Donald Trump's presidency. As an administration with an uncharted level of conflicts of interest prepares to take office, there will be no shortage of stories to investigate.

But how many stories we can fund, and how deep our reporters can dig, will depend in large part on the support from readers like you who help fund our coverage through their donations.

Please, help us keep it up. Make your donation today -- we promise it will be put to good use:

In solidarity,

44667476574_164196240724513,"On Inauguration Day—January 20, 2017—we're calling for a national strike and boycott to show our collective power in opposition to Trump's extremism. 

This strike and boycott, or Sick Out, will show the country and the world that we will not participate in Trump's America as he has described it. It will do so in the most powerful way possible—by shutting down, as much as possible, the nation's economy. 

The goal will be to force corporations and politicians to publicly distance themselves from Trump's agenda. The U.S. economy is a massive, complicated machine that runs on predictability and regularity. Disrupting it through a general strike and boycott imposes a cost on accepting Trump's extremism.

Americans have an uncanny ability to get used to the extreme in short order—we must take action before a sense of normalcy sets in. The message of a nationwide Sick Out on Inauguration Day will help prepare people for the multiple acts of resistance that will be required by us, in so many parts of our lives, if we are to avoid the worst over the next four years. The only thing holding us back from engaging in this collective action is our hesitancy to believe that it is possible.

This idea came from an article published in In These Times by an anonymous author, which is the 3rd most viewed article ever on InTheseTimes.com.

44667476574_10154758685121575,"This is how we plan to respond to Trump's attacks on press freedoms:

We all have legitimate reason to be distressed by the results of this election. Donald Trump spent his campaign directly targeting the most vulnerable in our society -- and blaming them for many of our nation's ills. There's no reason to believe that he won't carry out his threats once he takes office as president.

At In These Times, we promise to stand with the marginalized who will face the brunt of Trump's attacks, and who stand to suffer most as the result of his policies. And we will offer a roadmap for a progressive future, led by those who oppose and resist Trump's backwards, white nationalist agenda.

But we also know that a free and independent press has been one of Trump's most frequent targets.

Trump has called journalists ""the enemies"" and ""the lowest form of life."" He has threatened to ""open up"" libel laws so that he can sue publications that are critical of him. One of his top aides said last week that the executive editor of the New York Times ""should be in jail"" for the paper's ground-breaking reporting that revealed Trump paid no federal taxes for years.

That's the reality our reporters now face.

Right now we are in the midst of what is likely our most important fundraising drive ever. We need to raise $35,000 by December 31 to continue publishing the kind of uncompromising, fearless reporting that we know is needed.

If you believe that independent journalism is a key pillar of our democracy -- worthy of protection -- then please, make a donation to In These Times today:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/end-of-year-2016?refcode=20161205_FB_MKL

As a candidate, Donald Trump routinely revoked press credentials from mainstream media organizations that criticized him, banned reporters from covering his campaign, refused to hold press conferences, and incited his supporters to personally threaten journalists -- inviting both hate speech, and, potentially, violence.

The actions Trump has already threatened to take would represent the most severe crackdown on the freedom of the press since the McCarthy era. So how should we as an independent, progressive media outlet respond?

There's only one answer: Work even harder.

When our freedoms are under attack is when a strong and vibrant free press is more necessary than ever. The only way we will emerge from this dark chapter in our nation's history is with a crusading independent press that holds this new administration and its corporate backers to account. Our job just became more important than it has ever been.

You can join this effort and help us speak truth to power. Together, we can make sure that Trump and his allies fail in their efforts to silence journalists and their opposition.

Please, make a tax-deductible donation today to support the work of our journalists.

November 9th was a difficult morning. I cried, watching my baby daughter sleep, terrified for the future and so very angry that Donald J. Trump would actually be the next president.

I was also exhausted thinking about how hard folks were going to have to fight to protect themselves and the tenuous ground we've gained over the past few years, knowing the most vulnerable among us will have to shoulder most of that burden.

But I'm fortunate to be able to walk in to In These Times and get to work. For 40 years, In These Times has spoken truth to power, publishing independent journalism that exposes abuses by corporations and the government alike.

It's a true privilege to funnel my energy toward supporting an institution that gives voice to the movements that will make our world a better place. Our mission will be even more important in the next two months leading up to inauguration and in the coming Trump years—and In These Times is up to that challenge.

Today is Giving Tuesday, a national day of giving for nonprofits everywhere, many of whom are working to meet the most pressing and immediate needs of those who are most likely to be threatened by Donald Trump's administration.

If you can, we encourage you to donate to organizations doing this vital frontline work and direct service. Personally, my family is channeling our Giving Tuesday budget to support Syrian refugees and the children of incarcerated mothers.

Meanwhile, here at In These Times, we promise to redouble our efforts to:

• Uncover injustices that impact the most vulnerable in our community—including undocumented immigrants, Muslims, women, people of color and LGBTQ folks

• Stand up to the new administration's plans to undermine decades of progress on issues like reproductive health, voting rights and workers' rights

• Strengthen and amplify grassroots movements for racial, environmental, and economic justice including Black Lives Matter, NoDAPL and the Fight for 15

• Push the Democratic Party to move in a more progressive direction, shifting power from corporations to poor and working people

This work won't be easy, but together we can make it happen. This Giving Tuesday, you can also support us in these efforts by making a tax-deductible donation to In These Times—which is, and always has been, a non-profit organization founded for the public good:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/donate-to-in-these-times?refcode=20161129_FB_AR

Whether it's resisting deportations, standing up for reproductive healthcare, protecting our LGBTQ loved ones, or fighting the normalization of hate crimes; our work will prove more critical than ever.

We know this is an unusual fundraising ask, but these are unusual times. We must stand and work together to build the more just future we know is possible.

We're opening up the In These Times archives for a never-before-seen look at 40 years of progressive journalism -- including classic past issues going back to the 1970s, original production art, archival photos, behind the scenes documents and much more.

We will also be hosting a special post-election panel on the role independent media and progressive movements will play in 2017, featuring:

• Senior advisor to Bernie Sanders and Our Revolution board chair Larry Cohen

• National director of Black Youth Project 100 (BYP100) Charlene Carruthers

• Cook County Commissioner and former mayoral candidate Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia

We'll also honor Contributing Editor Kari Lydersen, author of Mayor 1%: Rahm Emanuel and the Rise of Chicago's 99%, and noted historian and community leader, Timuel Black.

Complimentary drinks and hors d'oeuvres will be provided, and you'll have a chance to meet and have a lively discussion with both new and longtime members of the progressive movement from Chicago and around the country.

You'll also be able to bid on special items—including archival materials—in a silent auction supporting of In These Times.
This is a once-in-40-years opportunity to take in a piece of progressive history, while also getting a look into the future of the movements that will define 2017 and beyond.

We'll be joined by African-American studies and history professor Martha Biondi, author of this month's cover story ""The Radicalism of Black Lives Matter,"" which explores how the movement is transforming the American political landscape—and the Left.  

Also joining us will be labor and community activist James Thindwa, author of ""The Black Establishment's Blank Check for Hillary Clinton,"" a dive into why the Black political elite got behind the Clinton campaign without demanding anything in return. 

As will be Keisa Reynolds, a former activist with We Charge Genocide, freelance writer, and community educator who lives in Chicago and is a supporter of the movement for black lives. 

This event is free. 

You can read the cover story, ""The Radicalism of Black Lives Matter,"" online now:

Other highlights from the issue include: 

—An investigation into how the government is allowing corporations to grab native lands for pennies.

—A look into how Obama's legacy on immigration is tainted by his administration's use of deportation raids.

Free copies of our July issue will be available, along with free snacks, beer courtesy of our friends at Revolution Brewing and plenty of lively discussion. 

We'll be joined by investigative reporter Adeshina Emmanuel, whose piece in this month's issue unmasks how police union contracts shield killer cops—and questions whether we can expect real reforms to result from the ongoing federal investigation of the CPD.

Also joining us will be former CPS principal Troy LaRaviere, who was interviewed in our July issue on his recent election as president of the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association and how to defeat the corporate school reform agenda of Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

Other highlights from the issue include: 

—Our cover story on the growing grassroots campaigns to stop Donald Trump from becoming president.

—A look into how Bernie Sanders' army of volunteers is being deployed down ballot. 
 
In These Times, an independent, nonprofit magazine, is dedicated to advancing democracy and economic justice, informing movements for a more humane world, and providing an accessible forum for debate about the policies that shape our future.

Moberg, a veteran labor reporter for In These Times, dives into the question of whether the replacement of workers with robot counterparts will mean more leisure time and economic equality, or greater unemployment, precarity and insecurity.   

Also featured in the issue is Theo Anderson's essay on the ties between Bernie Sanders and Saul Alinsky's radical democratic vision. 

David Moberg and Theo Anderson will discuss their stories, and other ITT staff and writers will be in attendance.

Free copies of the newest issue of In These Times will be available, along with free snacks, beer courtesy of our friends at Revolution Brewing, and plenty of conversation. 

Also currently on display in our office gallery:

Making Niggers: Demonizing and Distorting Blackness Through Racist Postcards and Images. 

This exhibit interrogates nigger as a word, a set of images, and as a social and political position. It asks the viewer: How did white people justify their continued subordination of Black people post emancipation? And suggests the answer: By creating and distributing racist cartoons of Black people on postcards and in advertisements.

This exhibition illustrates how little Black lives have mattered in this country and speaks to the anti-Black racism that still structures our present, says co-curator Mariame Kaba.

In These Times, an independent, nonprofit magazine, is dedicated to advancing democracy and economic justice, informing movements for a more humane world, and providing an accessible forum for debate about the policies that shape our future.

The cover story of the issue is a 6-month investigation revealing that the science behind regulation of toxic chemicals—including known carcinogens and endocrine disruptors such as formaldehyde and BPA—has been captured by industry and the Department of Defense, and may be fundamentally flawed, putting human health at great risk.

Making Niggers: Demonizing and Distorting Blackness Through Racist Postcards and Images. 

This exhibit interrogates nigger as a word, a set of images, and as a social and political position. It asks the viewer: How did white people justify their continued subordination of Black people post emancipation? And suggests the answer: By creating and distributing racist cartoons of Black people on postcards and in advertisements.

This exhibition illustrates how little Black lives have mattered in this country and speaks to the anti-Black racism that still structures our present, says co-curator Mariame Kaba.

In These Times, an independent, nonprofit magazine, is dedicated to advancing democracy and economic justice, informing movements for a more humane world, and providing an accessible forum for debate about the policies that shape our future.

http://inthesetimes.com/article/18273/how-cities-can-beat-wall-street

Wall Street banks are sucking American cities dry. Cities across the country have entered into toxic deals with big banks that are unnecessarily costing them millions (and sometimes billions) of dollars—money that could be spent on schools, parks, libraries, and other public goods. 

But they don't have to. In his story, Saqib Bhatti, director of the ReFund America Project and a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute and expert on municipal finance, offers a bold new plan for how cities can escape the death grip of the ""blood-sucking vampire squid"" that is Wall Street, reclaiming badly needed public funds and ending the austerity policies crushing poor, working- and middle-class people across the country.

In These Times will host a panel discussion and issue release party on September 16. Bhatti will speak on his story along with: 

--Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, newly elected alderman of the 35th Ward in Chicago 

--Stephen Lerner, a Fellow at the Kalmanovitz Intitiative for Labor and the Working Poor at Georgetown University and a veteran labor strategist. 

The panel will be moderated by In These Times Associate Editor Micah Uetricht. 

Free copies of the newest issue of In These Times will be available, along with free snacks, beer, and conversation. 

In These Times, an independent, nonprofit magazine, is dedicated to advancing democracy and economic justice, informing movements for a more humane world, and providing an accessible forum for debate about the policies that shape our future.

We have two portable toilets in our downstairs lobby with soap and sinks with working water. And we will have plenty of bottled water and complimentary beverages courtesy of our friends at Revolution Brewing. Sorry for the inconvenience! 

Join In These Times to celebrate the release of our February 2015 issue, featuring ""How to Sell Off a City"" by Rick Perlstein: A damning look at the privatization policies carried out under Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his predecessor Richard J. Daley, both of whom systematically sold city assets and services to far-off corporations looking to turn a profit. 

Our special issue on the Chicago mayoral election also includes David Moberg's analysis of why unions aren't lining up against Rahm Emanuel--despite the mayor's union-busting record. And Salim Muwakkil discusses the challenges to assembling a black-brown coalition behind Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia. 

Rick Perlstein, David Moberg and Salim Muwakkil will speak, along with other In These Times contributors. And you'll be hanging out right smack in the middle of ITT's office headquarters.

Plus:
Snacks! 
Complimentary beer from Revolution Brewing.
