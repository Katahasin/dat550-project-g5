President Trump has signed executive orders ending all efforts to stop and reverse climate change. He is rescinding President Obama's six climate change orders. He is instructing the Environmental Protection Agency to cease its climate change efforts and do no environmental regulations that get in the way of profits or ""jobs."" The EPA is to only concern itself with ""clean air and clean water"" - while Trump orders a massive increase in the use of coal. 

This is a defining moment in the history of mankind. By signing these executive orders today, Trump is declaring an act of war on the planet and its inhabitants. The one silver lining here is that Trump can't kill the planet; the planet wants to live and has a long history of wiping out any real or perceived threats. With the actions Trump is taking today, the planet is paying attention -- and the planet will make sure it dispenses with a species hell-bent on destroying Earth.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/39415631",Trump to sweep away Obama climate change policies - BBC News,link,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/39415631,2017-03-28 13:50:54,70938,7772,43889,16883,161,964,179,15518,37233

If you're like me, you have no love for the FBI, the NSA or the CIA. If you are from my generation, you know these are very often nefarious institutions. The FBI spied on Martin Luther King to stop his civil rights activities. The NSA was ordered to make up stuff on Iraq so Bush could start a war. The CIA has had leaders of countries assassinated and democratically-elected Presidents (Iran, Chile, Guatemala) overthrown. These secret organizations have for decades committed so many acts in our name that have done much damage to good people and movements here and around the world. They spied on everyday average Americans whose crime was to simply attend a protest. Like you. And me. (To this day, I have yet to ask for the file they kept on me in the past. It was shown to me once, at NBC -- provided to them by General Motors in an attempt by the company to keep me off my first-ever appearance on the Tonight Show in 1990. Yes, a crazy story to be sure, and one I will write more about some other time because right now we have graver matters to address.)

Trump's insane flurry of tweets at 6:30 in the morning yesterday may not have been so insane at all. Under President Obama, these intelligence agencies were fortunately somewhat reined in. I say ""somewhat"" because clearly FBI director James Comey was allowed to go rogue against Hillary Clinton.

But if the Obama administration had evidence that the Trump campaign ""was in constant contact with Russian officials and well-known Russian spies,"" and there was already proof that the Russians had hacked into our electoral process, then it not only is possible that the Justice Department or the national security apparatus decided to get a warrant to dig deeper, I think most patriotic Americans would agree with me that the Obama administration HAD AN OBLIGATION to order that wiretap because an act of treason -- Trump campaign people colluding with Russia to affect the outcome of our election -- had taken place. 

If any wiretap was ever justified -- and I would say that they RARELY are -- this would be the one time we should HOPE our government was looking out for us and protecting us. 

Sneaking the Russian ambassador in thru the basement of Trump Tower -- Trump's personal home -- secretly bringing him up to the top floors, and later telling us that Trump ""never met the ambassador"" while the Russian was inside his own home(!), would be enough for me to want to investigate further. Much further. 

Trump thought yesterday he would try to get in front of the Russian scandal by claiming HE was the ""victim"" of President Obama. A smart move by a clever man. Make it seem that the wiretap is the crime -- instead of the ACTUAL crime that the wiretapping was going to expose -- namely, the illegal collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials. 

Trump knows the hounds are close and on his trail, and this Hail Mary move of his may seem crazy, but like all the other Trump crazy that got him into the White House -- yes, it's crazy.

There should be no doubt after watching this that something is very, very wrong when it comes to Trump and the Russians. And I'm not just talking about the election. Today Trump will swear-in to his Cabinet the largest shareholder and vice-chair of the Bank of CYPRUS as his ""American"" Commerce Secretary -- the latest Russian operative and collaborator who happens to be an American citizen because he was born here and holds an American passport.

24674986856_10154204734176857,"It was probably a bit too much to ask the 435-member Democratic National Committee to admit to their role (as the party apparatus) in the colossal failure to get the candidate the majority of Americans (by 3 million votes) said they wanted as their President. How hard can it be to get the actual winner of the vote inaugurated? I guess if you're the Democratic Party, just because you win the Super Bowl, it doesn't mean you get to wear the Super Bowl ring. That makes sense, right? 435 honchos of the party and none of them had a pencil or a map or the ability to do electoral college math? No one had a plane ticket to give the candidate to visit Wisconsin for seven long months during the campaign? Too busy polishing their ""SUPER DELEGATE"" plaques on their desks?

So, I get it -- this was not the group that was going to install a Bernie-loving, Detroit-bred, Muslim-American and hardcore successful grassroots organizer who had helped orchestrate turning a Midwestern red state blue a few years ago. They wanted to play it safe and so they picked a decent guy. The good news is that Tom Perez is not a step backward to the old conservative Democratic DLC days. He is not Al Frum. He is a progressive and shares most of Keith Ellison's agenda, just as Hillary had adopted 80% of Bernie's plans. So, not the end of the world, and maybe a surprise to boot down the road. We will hope and pray for this. 

Of course, it was not helpful yesterday, before the election of the new chair, that the 435 leaders of the Democratic Party voted against President Obama's ban on the Party taking corporate PAC money. Corporate lobbyists can now write big checks so they can get their pipelines, their TPP trade deals (that cost them the election in the rust belt), and so they can keep the for-profit health insurance industry intact. Not a good sign. The Party still doesn't get it and they clearly don't see the millions in the streets, the thousands packing the town hall meetings or the Capitol Hill switchboards that are still jammed, 37 days in a row now (202-225-3121). 

Ok, fine. We'll work with the hand we're dealt. And here's how -- with a very clear message to the old guard of the Democratic leadership: We're not ""uniting"" with you - you're uniting with US. We, the people, the majority, the Resistance, will LEAD and we enthusiastically welcome you to follow. We will be the ones stopping Trump and we welcome you to watch and learn how a pissed-off majority - who have twice in 16 years seen the winner we elected not being inaugurated - operates. We are fierce, we are relentless and we are right. We have the moral and patriotic wind at our backs because the majority Americans agree with us. We will not ""compromise"" or find ""common ground"" with misogynists, racists and haters. We won't give an inch and we will show you how to do that. Nonviolent mass protest. In-person visits and daily calls to our elected representatives. Running for office and throwing some of you who are appeasers and collaborators out. Writing checks to Planned Parenthood and ACLU. Pushing for true universal health care in Blue States where we can get it passed. And convincing the 100 million members of America's largest political party -- The Non-Voters Party -- to join us at the polls in 2018 for a raucous and legally riotous overthrow of the Republican Congress.

So, DNC, watch, listen, and join. Follow our lead. You essentially work for us (although none of us know how it is in this democracy you get picked to be on the DNC, but we have a feeling it has something to do with each of us running for precinct delegate in our neighborhoods, so we'll do that, too!). 

Thank you for making Keith Ellison the deputy chair of the party and thank you Keith for also deciding to stay in Congress. Let's help Tom Perez and the executive committee follow the Resistance and use all the means available to them to stop Trump and do good for the country. 

Meanwhile, many in the Resistance will become active in their local Democratic Parties, run for local leadership and field candidates for next year's elections. Eventually, that 435-member committee will more closely resemble what the people want. I'll say it again -- how a party like the Democrats could WIN the popular vote in SIX OF THE LAST SEVEN Presidential elections but end up holding ZERO power in ANY branch of government in 2017 is a humiliation of gargantuan proportions.

24674986856_10154201281436857,"Dear Members of the Democratic National Committee:

Beginning at 10am this morning you will choose the new chair of the Democratic Party. I am writing to you (and I believe tens of millions of Americans agree with me) to ask that you cease the old, losing ways of this party. Twice in the past 16 years we, the American people, have overwhemingly voted for the Democrat for President -- only to end up watching the losing Republican be seated in the Oval Office. What other group or sports team or political party who wins a contest is declared the loser? The Democratic candidate has won the popular vote in SIX of the last SEVEN presidential elections and yet, as we awake this morning, our side holds NO power in ANY branch of our government! How can this be?

As much as I am grateful for your service on the DNC over the years, I hope you can see that now is the time for a serious change in direction and the installation of new, energetic voices in the leadership of this party. 

I speak to you as a Midwestern voter whp saw my part of the country put Donald Trump in office. Last spring and summer, I tried to warn you, this party, that Trump was going to win the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania. I called these our ""Brexit states,"" filled with the former middle class who have been abandoned by both parties. We lost Michigan by just 3 votes per precinct! The total combined vote we lost by in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania would not even fill 2/3 of the University of Michigan stadium in Ann Arbor. 
You did not listen to me then. I am hoping you listen to me today. 

I'm asking that you vote to elect Keith Ellison as the new chair of the DNC. Keith's background is as an organizer, and it is definitely an organizer of Keith's caliber that we need now more than ever. He comes from the Midwest -- born and raised in Detroit, he moved to Minnesota where he did the serious grassroots organizing that helped turn Minnesota from electing Republicans to electing Democrats. As our first Muslim member of Congress, he has been an outspoken advocate for tolerance, peace, diversity and justice. That he has the backing of so many Jewish Americans, from Chuck Schumer to Gloria Steinem, is indicative of how he is a beloved figure in our national politics, not something you can say about many politicians in Congress.

Things have to change. We need you to make a strong, bold move today. We need a fearless leader, not of the establishment, but of the people. You need to win back the working class, the union members of the rust belt. There's a reason the autoworkers union, the steelworkers union, the Teamsters, the AFL-CIO and many other unions have backed Keith and not our recent Labor Secretary. This is not a knock on Tom, a good and decent man. The point here is that we need to start winning and start now. You need to think outside the box and make a powerful statement to the blue states we lost and to the youth who came alive last year and led a voter revolution to support a man three times their age. Please listen to them this morning. Do not take the safe but failed path. Be brave. Put the country, not your position on the DNC, first.

We won by 3 million votes. It should be nothing short of humiliating that the winner became the loser. You can blame Trump, Comey, Putin, and the originators of the genius idea called the Electoral College. But in the end, you know where the buck stops. It stops with a campaign that wouldn't visit Wisconsin for 7 long months, and a Party lost in its own bubble, popping corks at the close of an admitedly great convention, celebrating four months in advance, the election of President Hillary Clinton.

When you blow it this big, with all due respect, you have to admit your failure and either move on or stay and work with Rep. Ellison in the bottom-up, grassroots Midwestern organizing that has to be done. I look forward to doing my part in making that happen. 

Sincerely,

24674986856_10154196631521857,"HOW TO STOP TRUMP (Pocket Edition) by Michael Moore

1. THE DAILY CALL: You must call Congress every day. Yes - YOU! 202-225-3121. It will take just TWO MINUTES! Make it part of your daily routine. It's even better to try their direct line. For Senators, find their numbers here: http://bit.ly/2kko0Ao. For the direct line to your Congressman/woman in the House of Representatives: http://house.gov/representatives. But here's the best way to call them: Go to the App Store and get ""5 Calls"". The app will dial the friggin' phone for you and give you talking points for when you speak to your reps. Remember -- a call a day keeps the Trump away.
 
2. THE MONTHLY VISIT: To add even more pressure, SHOW UP! Your member of Congress has a local office in your town or somewhere nearby. So do both of your U.S. Senators (often in the nearest federal building). Go there and ask to speak to them or their aides about the issues you care about. And when they have a town hall meeting, be there!

3. YOUR RAPID RESPONSE TEAM: You and 5 to 20 friends must form a Rapid Response Team so that when we need to leap into action (like we did at the airports the hour after Trump signed his Muslim Ban), we can email and text those closest to us to make an instant plan. 

4. JOIN! JOIN! JOIN!: If you haven't already, it's time to join some of our great national groups: Planned Parenthood, ACLU, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Socialists of America, ERA Action, MoveOn.org – the list goes on and on. And all the new groups that have sprung up to fight Trump: IndivisibleGuide.com, TownHallProject.com, Organizing for Action (ofa.us), ActionGroups.net, etc. Go and so many more. Sign up!

5. WOMEN'S MARCH NEVER ENDS: The historic, record-breaking January 21st Women's March on Washington -- and the hundreds of other Marches that day across the US and the world, with over 4 million in attendance! -- inspired millions and ignited hundreds of local movements. Every day now dozens of actions continue to take place as if the Women's March never ended. It hasn't. Join it! Go to my RESISTANCE CALENDAR (www.resistancecalendar.com) where you can find out what actions are taking place near you.

6. TAKE OVER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY: The old guard of the Party has twice in 16 years presided over the majority of Americans electing the Democrat to the White House -- only for us all to see the losing Republican inaugurated as President. How is it that we have won the popular vote in SIX OF THE LAST SEVEN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS -- the Republicans have only won ONCE since 1988 -- and yet, we hold NO power in any branch of government?! We must elect reform and progressive candidate, Congressman Keith Ellison, as the new DNC chair. Keith is a former community organizer, the first Muslim elected to Congress, and a key backer of Bernie Sanders. Sign his petition of support at www.keithfordnc.org/howyoucanhelp. And locally, you need to start attending your county Democratic meetings. If possible, organize your friends and others and take over your local Democratic organization.
 
7. LET'S FORM BLUE REGIONS OF RESISTANCE: People keep saying, ""I live in a Blue State - what can I do?"" Show the rest of America what it could look like in a state where Trump isn't in charge! New York should go ahead and offer Free College for All. California can create its own Universal Health Care. Oregon can stop mass incarceration of African Americans. Hawaii can enact its own climate change laws. Important historical note: Before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal, California and New York passed their own state laws to make it legal. This greatly helped pave the way for CHOICE being the new normal – and, three years later, for the enactment of Row v. Wade. 

8. YOU MUST RUN FOR OFFICE: I know, that's the LAST thing you want to do. But if we keep leaving the job up to the dismal, lame, pathetic political hacks who have sold us all down the river, then what right do we have to complain? This is only going to get fixed when you and I decide we are willing to put in our time -- even if it is a brief time -- and run for office. Run for school board, town council, state senate in 2018. I ran when I was 18 and got elected. You can, too. At the very least, run for precinct delegate. The time commitment is just 3 hours a year! Call your city or county clerk and find out how to get on the ballot. If you'll do it, I'll do it.
 
9. JOIN THE ARMY OF COMEDY: Trump's Achilles heel is his massively thin skin. He can't take mockery. So we all need to MOCK HIM UP! I truly believe the final tipping point for Trump will be when he implodes from all the laughter -- the mocking, the unbearable ridicule of tens of millions of Americans that will discombobulate him and force him out of the White House. I don't know what happened to Trump in boarding school at 13 and I don't care. Whatever it was, let's use it. He's used all the other things he picked up over the years - misogyny, bigotry, greed - against the powerless and the unfortunate. It's time to laugh him outta town. And if there's one thing we all could use right now is a good laugh -- AND the possibility of a much-shortened presidential term.

www.michaelmoore.com

1. THE DAILY CALL: You must call Congress every day. Yes - YOU! 202-225-3121. It will take just TWO MINUTES! Make it part of your daily routine. It's even better to try their direct line. For Senators, find their numbers here: http://bit.ly/2kko0Ao. For the direct line to your Congressman/woman in the House of Representatives: http://house.gov/representatives. But here's the best way to call them: Go to the App Store and get ""5 Calls"". The app will dial the friggin' phone for you and give you talking points for when you speak to your reps. Remember -- a call a day keeps the Trump away.
 
2. THE MONTHLY VISIT: To add even more pressure, SHOW UP! Your member of Congress has a local office in your town or somewhere nearby. So do both of your U.S. Senators (often in the nearest federal building). Go there and ask to speak to them or their aides about the issues you care about. And when they have a town hall meeting, be there!

3. YOUR RAPID RESPONSE TEAM: You and 5 to 20 friends must form a Rapid Response Team so that when we need to leap into action (like we did at the airports the hour after Trump signed his Muslim Ban), we can email and text those closest to us to make an instant plan. 

4. JOIN! JOIN! JOIN!: If you haven't already, it's time to join some of our great national groups: Planned Parenthood, ACLU, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Socialists of America, ERA Action, MoveOn.org – the list goes on and on. And all the new groups that have sprung up to fight Trump: IndivisibleGuide.com, TownHallProject.com, Organizing for Action (ofa.us), ActionGroups.net, etc. Go and so many more. Sign up!

5. WOMEN'S MARCH NEVER ENDS: The historic, record-breaking January 21st Women's March on Washington -- and the hundreds of other Marches that day across the US and the world, with over 4 million in attendance! -- inspired millions and ignited hundreds of local movements. Every day now dozens of actions continue to take place as if the Women's March never ended. It hasn't. Join it! Go to my RESISTANCE CALENDAR (www.resistancecalendar.com) where you can find out what actions are taking place near you.

6. TAKE OVER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY: The old guard of the Party has twice in 16 years presided over the majority of Americans electing the Democrat to the White House -- only for us all to see the losing Republican inaugurated as President. How is it that we have won the popular vote in SIX OF THE LAST SEVEN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS -- the Republicans have only won ONCE since 1988 -- and yet, we hold NO power in any branch of government?! We must elect reform and progressive candidate, Congressman Keith Ellison, as the new DNC chair. Keith is a former community organizer, the first Muslim elected to Congress, and a key backer of Bernie Sanders. Sign his petition of support at www.keithfordnc.org/howyoucanhelp. And locally, you need to start attending your county Democratic meetings. If possible, organize your friends and others and take over your local Democratic organization.
 
7. LET'S FORM BLUE REGIONS OF RESISTANCE: People keep saying, ""I live in a Blue State - what can I do?"" Show the rest of America what it could look like in a state where Trump isn't in charge! New York should go ahead and offer Free College for All. California can create its own Universal Health Care. Oregon can stop mass incarceration of African Americans. Hawaii can enact its own climate change laws. Important historical note: Before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal, California and New York passed their own state laws to make it legal. This greatly helped pave the way for CHOICE being the new normal – and, three years later, for the enactment of Row v. Wade. 

8. YOU MUST RUN FOR OFFICE: I know, that's the LAST thing you want to do. But if we keep leaving the job up to the dismal, lame, pathetic political hacks who have sold us all down the river, then what right do we have to complain? This is only going to get fixed when you and I decide we are willing to put in our time -- even if it is a brief time -- and run for office. Run for school board, town council, state senate in 2018. I ran when I was 18 and got elected. You can, too. At the very least, run for precinct delegate. The time commitment is just 3 hours a year! Call your city or county clerk and find out how to get on the ballot. If you'll do it, I'll do it.
 
9. JOIN THE ARMY OF COMEDY: Trump's Achilles heel is his massively thin skin. He can't take mockery. So we all need to MOCK HIM UP! I truly believe the final tipping point for Trump will be when he implodes from all the laughter -- the mocking, the unbearable ridicule of tens of millions of Americans that will discombobulate him and force him out of the White House. I don't know what happened to Trump in boarding school at 13 and I don't care. Whatever it was, let's use it. He's used all the other things he picked up over the years - misogyny, bigotry, greed - against the powerless and the unfortunate. It's time to laugh him outta town. And if there's one thing we all could use right now is a good laugh -- AND the possibility of a much-shortened presidential term. 

Please share this and spread the word. Follow me on Twitter (@MMFlint) and Facebook (facebook.com/mmflint) and I'll keep posting ideas on what we all can do. We can stop him. We can nonviolently block and obstruct halt the damage he's doing. But it's going to need -- and take -- ALL HANDS ON DECK!

I've promised you a one-stop site, a clearinghouse of all actions -- a RESISTANCE CALENDAR -- where you can find EVERY upcoming action, protest, march, sit-in, town hall, anti-Trump, pro-democracy event in all 50 states! A site where YOU can post your own action so all can see it. A place where you can quickly go and check it daily, ensuring that you don't miss any event in your area to stop the Trump madness. 

So, right now, I and a team of graphic designers are launching the RESISTANCE CALENDAR! 

Here's the link: resistancecalendar.org

In addition to you finding events in your area, we want you to be able to post any local actions you're aware of. So much is happening so fast it's hard to keep track of all the actions popping up -- but our intention is to do just that. Every day. A 24/7 clearinghouse of the already MASSIVE resistance to Trump, to the Republican Congress, and, yes, to many of the spineless Democratic politicians out there. We welcome all resisters across the movement to use this tool. It's completely free. There's no big ""funder"" or group behind it. There will be no ads, no commercialization, no fundraising lists -- all the stuff we hate. Just you, me, the volunteers donating their time to keep it going and the World Wide Web. BOOM!

Follow the Resistance Calendar on Facebook at: facebook.com/resistancecalendar

Follow Resistance Calendar on Twitter at @ResistCalendar

Go to our site at www.resistancecalendar.org

When you go on Resistance Calendar, go to the search box and type in your city or state to find events near you. You can also type in keywords to find actions around issues in which you share a concern. Or you can just scroll down and see every upcoming event across the country in chronological order. In the other box you can add events happening in your area. Our team carefully curates the listings to guarantee accuracy. 

A note of explanation: As we are still building this site, we will be constantly upgrading it. For instance, it's going to have a killer map of the US and a big desk-style calendar where you can just click on any day and see what's happening with the movement across America. We'll have better and easier filters and other goodies. But for now, I wanted to get this up and let millions know what's going on in their area. 

Many large cities like New York, Seattle and Portland have excellent independent calendars online. My goal has been to have one all-encompassing national calendar covering even the smallest towns and villages. This calendar isn't meant to replace anything out there that is doing great work, just add to it! A lot of you have asked me to put something like this together, so consider this as a simple contribution to the movement. It is crowdsourced, vetted and belongs to everyone. Let us know if you want to be part of the volunteer tech and curation team!

I sincerely hope this is a huge help and that all of you use it! Sign up on Facebook and Twitter now -- and please tell your friends about it. Take a moment to add all the local events you know of. And remember -- All hands on deck! It's the only way we're going to beat him and lessen the damage he's doing. Our goal is his removal from office -- and the defeat of any politician who isn't with us. WE ARE THE MAJORITY.

Today's rally is sponsored by and paid for by ""Re-Elect Trump 2020"". I'm serious. This is happening.  Trump doesn't intend to leave until January, 2025. He'll be close to 80 then. His filing, this rally, is his way of saying, ""PRESIDENT FOR LIFE."" HIS life. Not exactly ""a Reich that lasts 1,000 years,"" but when you're a massive narcissist, you don't really give a shit about a thousand years from now -- just the years when you're going to be around to do the damage.

24674986856_10154185923756857,"JOB OPENING: A few years ago I restored and opened a closed-down, century-old movie house in the small town where I live in northern Michigan. I built it as a great place to see films because I wanted to bring the best movies to a city that was often missing out on the great cinema the world has to offer. I set it up as a nonprofit gift to the community, and hundreds of local residents joined me in this mostly all-volunteer effort. I'm the head of the board and the chief volunteer (my job is to program the movies every week). I also hire a couple people to be the theater's managers. 

We've got a manager job opening right now and I'm looking for the right person to hire and help me run the historic State Theatre of Traverse City, Michigan. The work is not always glamorous -- there's trash to take out, getting a crushed Junior Mint out of the seat fabric is frustrating, and asking a 16-year breaking up with his girlfriend on his cell phone during a movie is often met with resistance -- but the rewards are very satisfying. You will play a crucial role in making a vibrant community movie house flourish and thrive. It is, in many ways, a labor of love, bringing great movies to a very appreciative small town that is a progressive oasis (Bernie got 70% of the primary vote here) yet now sits in a newly-minted red state. But the cinema I program at the State is transformational, the civic engagement is powerful, and we've now restored and are running a second movie theater in town -- the Bijou by the Bay (did I mention the town is nestled on the shores of beautiful Lake Michigan?). The nearest interstate is an hour away, we call soda in Michigan ""pop"" and we only charge $2 for it and for the best popcorn anywhere. We have two big bookstores on the main street, three public/community radio stations and lots of snow. 

We're looking for a true lover of cinema, someone who believes in the importance of experiencing movies on the big screen with 500 other people (the way they were meant to be seen). A background and experience in film and/or movie theaters is preferred. We pay above a living wage and above the town's average income with full benefits, we practice affirmative action and we encourage Iraq/Afghanistan veterans to apply. But because it's a community and volunteer-run nonprofit, it's not the kind of job that is going to help you afford a membership at Mar-a-Lago. Nonetheless, you will be popping the corn in one of the top ten theaters in the world according to the Motion Picture Association of America's list of the best places to see a movie.  (Check out our theaters here: www.stateandbijou.org)

If you are seriously interested in the job, send me an email with resume and any information you think will be helpful to tcmanagersearch17@gmail.com. 

Thanks -- and for the rest of you, if you're ever in the area, stop in and catch a movie sometime! Trust me, it's unlike any movie theater you're used to. Every neighborhood and town in America should have one of these. That's my next mission, once we get the Russians settled in DC.",,status,,2017-02-18 14:39:40,12197,1095,2465,10440,1598,106,48,1,4
24674986856_10154178619891857,"Everyone! Our job this morning is to call our members of Congress and US Senators -- especially the Democrats -- and demand that they cease all Congressional business until they appoint a special committee to investigate the ""numerous"" links between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials. They must also call upon Attorney General Sessions to recuse himself and appoint a special prosecutor. The Dems must bring a halt to anything happening on the floor of the Senate or House until this is done. To carry on as if this potentially traitorous action never happened, to just go about ""business as usual"" today, is an OBSCENITY. Hundreds of thousands of your relatives and mine died so we could have this most basic of rights: A free and fair and incorruptible election. If we are not willing to fight for THIS, then WHO ARE WE? If our Democratic representatives are too spineless to shut this charade down, theN they must be put on notice TODAY that we will primary them in 2018 with REAL progressive fighters who are true Democrats.

It's what we all suspected. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what was going on: TRUMP COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS TO THROW THE ELECTION TO HIM. 

So this is what I want done NOW: 

1. I and tens of millions of Americans demand that the weak and spineless Democrats bring Congress to a halt until investigative hearings are held and impeachment charges are filed. We don't want to hear you Dems huff and puff and grandstand and take symbolic actions. We demand that you halt all actions being taken by an illegitimately elected government until this matter is resolved. 

2. Attorney General J Beauregard Sessions must immediately appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate these potentially treasonous acts. 

3. So-Called President Trump could save the country a lot of time, money and pain by stepping down tonight. 

4. Somehow, our judicial system has to find a way to make restitution to this country. Pence can't be president as he, too, was elected under this same fraud. The court has to rule either that the President is the winner of  the popular vote OR the election must be held over. The Republicans-- the beneficiaries of this treason --cannot be allowed to hold on to the power by default.

Now that Flynn is gone, he can rejoin his son in pedaling the story that Hillary was running a pedophile ring out of Comet Pizza. This is what was passing for National Security. Whackjob...

I'm fondly remembering Michael Flynn at the Republican convention leading the cheer from the stage: ""LOCK HER UP!"" Now it may be him who gets locked up. Be careful what you wish for!...

Flynn was colluding with a foreign government accused of helping throw the election to Trump, promising them they would be taken care of. Arrest him...

Let's be VERY clear: Flynn DID NOT make that Russian call on his own. He was INSTRUCTED to do so.He was TOLD to reassure them. Arrest Trump...

TRUMP KNEW EVERYTHING. It will all come out. Along with the rest of Trump's collusion & obedience to Putin. #IMPEACH...

I thank the teachers who show my films to their classes -- not a day goes by where I don't get a few dozen posts or emails from students who saw one of my movies in their classroom that day. 

I feel very blessed that I get to keep making films. I will soon start my next one. Or I may have already started it (I don't talk about my movies when I'm making them). I believe in the power of cinema. I believe even more in the power of those who watch it and what they do with it once they leave the theater. Thanks to all who continue to fight this necessary fight. For my part, I'll continue to do what I think I do best. We're all in this together.

We're all back home from last weekend's marches and - BOOM! - the movement has been ignited! I've heard from thousands of you in the past few days -- and you just haven't stopped: 

• Hundreds of you from Salt Lake City flew back home Sunday from DC and on Monday morning joined with thousands of other Utahans to peacefully storm your State Capitol on the first day on its legislative session. Wow!

• On Tuesday, thousands who were at one of the Women""s Marches showed up for #ResistTrumpTuesdays around the country by peacefully invading their members of Congress' local office.

• On Wednesday, upon hearing Trump's pronouncement that he was going after hard-working immigrants in this country, thousands took to the streets from New York to LA in numbers that surprised local law enforcement (many of whom joined in by saying they would refuse to arrest so-called ""illegals"").

Today there were teach-ins all over the U.S. As Trump has signed one disgusting executive order after another, the shock and anger has only grown. He is our lead organizer -- and with every stroke of the pen, every mentally deranged comment made, every tweet the twit sends, our numbers grow into the tens of millions. He will not be able to govern a nation that will increasingly reject him out of hand. Do not despair, good friends, the great unraveling has already begun. It may take a while, and it will definitely take a lot of work on each of our parts, but we will win out in the end. 

And thank you for helping me jam the Congressional switchboard all week! Oh, yeah! What's that number? 202-225-3121!!!! Senators and House members all report near-record numbers of calls. It has major impact. Even if you can't through -- just the act of helping overload the phone lines sends a strong message that the constituents are upset. Let's keep dailing that number! Thank you!

He certainly would have understood their pain and anger -- but would he have forgiven that they lashed out at their injustice by voting for a racist? Or by staying home? Or by leaving the presidential part on the ballot blank? And what about the minority of white people who voted for Hillary -- what's our responsibility in all this, for letting White America install Trump as our leader? Could we have done more? Should white supporters of Hillary have had their eyes more open, stepped outside their ""Hillary-is-going-to-win!"" bubble, turned off the TV and the pundits and the pollsters and paid some real attention? Are white liberals still listening to these hacks? Were white Hillary supporters really that bad at math that they couldn't read an electoral map? Were the white people in Wisconsin really that uncool and so disgustingly working class to the hipsters at the Brooklyn HQ that they didn't deserve a visit from their candidate for seven long months? Are white liberals still in some sort of denial that this is actually happening? Black people aren't in denial. They've been living with this hate and racism and neglect forever and are not at all in shock over what's happened. That white women gave Trump the boost he needed to put him over the Electoral top is no surprise to them. White liberals believed that white women were going to save us from the angry white men who were and are the bulk of Trump's army. That didn't happen. What would Dr. King say about all of this? What could he tell us to soothe our hurt and allay our fears? Would he lead us in the fight one more time, or would he just hang his head today and simply weep. Just when the road seemed so much much shorter it suddenly got longer. And meaner. And almost unnavigable. He can't help us now. White people saw to that. The choice to fight is now left in our hands. And if you are white, don't we have an actual RESPONSIBILITY to undo this horrible wrong committed by our white neighbors, family members, co-workers and classmates? Shouldn't every single one of us be in the streets of DC this Friday and Saturday, nonviolently and forcefully resisting this moral crime White America has committed? Don't you want every African American, Muslim, Mexican, every LGBTQ American, every disabled person and every woman who's been grabbed and assaulted and humiliated by men like Trump to know that this wasn't YOU, that YOU won't be silent, that YOU will protect them and defend them and MAKE THIS RIGHT? Does not every single white person on this Martin Luther King Day have a shared DUTY to get up, stand up, march, resist, oppose, obstruct and make your voice heard so that no more harm comes to those who aren't born white and straight and Christian? This isn't a choice. This isn't something you get to think about. This is the only way to redeem ourselves, to answer the cry from Dr, King from his grave to not let all that he did and all that those good people who can before us did go to waste. Our silence right now will end his dream for good, and end the dreams of those who struggle day to day and week to week to  simply survive. White America gave the world Donald J. Trump. But I f the 40%+ of white people who didn't vote for him are willing to join with the 90%+ of Black America and the majority of other people of color who also didn't vote for him, then that makes us the majority.

24674986856_10154095395841857,"Here's why Congressman and civil rights legend John Lewis is right that Trump ""is not a legitimate President"":

1. Nothing, including an arcane, racist section of the constitution, can change the fact that 3 million more Americans voted for Hillary than for Trump. It's either a democracy or it isn't. If he had won by 3 million, I would sadly admit that Trump is the President the American people wanted. But that's not what happened. 

2. He is not well and needs help. He has a number of serious mental disorders that make him unfit to hold office -- and they are on display every day in one cringe-worthy tweet after another. He is a full-blown malignant narcissist. He displays sociopathic tendencies. He will say one thing and 30 seconds later say the opposite. He is disconnected from the truth. And he has a stunning lack of human empathy. These behaviors make him a truly dangerous occupant of the Oval Office.

3. The Russians interfered with the election in order to get him elected. Even Trump now admits as much. That alone makes the election tainted and should be voided. We spend trillions on ridiculous weapons and ineffective police state-style homeland security measures to defend us against those who would ""destroy our way of life"" -- but we are to remain silent when a foreign government is caught trying to get THEIR candidate elected as OUR president? AND they succeed! This is a joke of monstrous proportions -- and the fact that conservatives, Republicans and patriotic good ol' boys are actively defending this foreign aggression into our country confirms to me what I've feared all along: that they really hate our form of democracy, our Bill of Rights, our belief that ""All men (sic) are created equal,"" our one person-one vote system, that whoever scores the most points wins and that people of all religions are welcome here. They don't believe that, and I'd respect them so much more if they would just simply admit it.  

4. The FBI clearly chose sides, and FBI Director Comey's interference in the 10 days before the election most-definitely helped tipped the balance to the FBI's preferred candidate, Donald J. Trump. That our own federal police would so brazenly attempt to throw the election to the person with the least votes is mind-boggling, frightening and must be stopped. Attorney General Lynch must immediately, today, appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate what to me appears to be a criminal offense. If this is true, I want to see FBI Director Comey in handcuffs and behind bars. Short of murder and a few other heinous acts, is there a worse crime in our democracy than the highest ranking cop in the land attempting to throw the election? 

5. Trump has nominated in Rex Tillerson the most powerful corporate CEO in the world as ""our"" Secretary of State. Why would the quarter-billionaire head of the world's richest corporation want a ""government job?"" So that he, a personal friend of Putin's, can get the US sanctions lifted off Russia so that his company, ExxonMobil, can get back to their exclusive oil deal with Russia -- which will eventually net ExxonMobil three TRILLION dollars. This is nothing less than a bold, audacious robbery in broad daylight -- and it says a lot about you and me that they think they can get away with it. 

6. Trump has potentially committed a number of felonies -- and a felon simply can't sit in the Oval Office (I can't believe I even have to state that). From his admitted sexual assaults to whatever he's hiding in the tax returns, to possibly evading taxes, to his committing fraud with Trump U, to his long list of conflicts of interest -- the chance of us having to suffer through his impeachment trial in the Senate is just too much to bear. 

Donald Trump is, as John Lewis said, NOT a legitimate president. He is unfit, unstable and was elected with help from the Russian government. John Lewis has announced he will not attend the Inauguration, and eight other members of Congress today have joined him. Call (202-225-3121) or write your Congressperson and insist he or she not attend the swearing in of an illegitimate president. It's the least you can do short of standing in front of this runaway train.  -- Michael Moore",,status,,2017-01-14 16:10:23,66228,4227,25565,57807,5049,296,175,530,2371
24674986856_10154088898556857,"President Obama -- My Final Requests of You:
 
Sir, you have one week left as our President. There are no words to express the my profound sadness in typing such words. Thank you for giving us eight years of your life. 

With so little time left, I hope you don't mind if I ask you for a favor or two. Well, actually, five. I can guarantee you I am not alone in these requests; in fact, I'm guessing millions of our fellow Americans share in these sincere final asks of you:

1. Please order the Army Corps of Engineers to Flint, Michigan, today. The water is still contaminated, the pipes have still not been replaced. Every single day the people are still being slowly poisoned. Every single child in Flint now has some form of developmental damage in their brain. Flint has again been forgotten. Please, please don't leave office without sending in the troops to save these 100,000 lives. 

2. Please release former Army Spec. Chelsea Manning from federal prison. The documents she released told the American public the truth behind the Iraq War (an act similar to what Daniel Ellsberg was LAUDED for doing during the Vietnam War). Four Army intelligence officers told NBC News this week that the items she released did not cause any danger or harm to anyone in the military, and they thought her 35-year sentence was ""excessive."" She pleaded guilty and apologized to the court and to the nation. Manning is now in her 7th year in prison. In the past year, she has twice attempted suicide. Please show mercy and commute her sentence for the seven years she has served. 

3. Please also release Native American leader Leonard Peltier from prison. There are many questions about his conviction after the Wounded Knee stand-off in 1977. He has served 40 years in prison and is now 72-years old and very ill. He deserves to spend his final days at home with his family and his people. 

4. Please declare an end to the ""War on Drugs."" Tens of thousands of Americans have had their lives ruined by being thrown in prison for using, possessing or selling marijuana. You can, today, declare an end to the federal prohibition against marijuana and ""de-schedule"" it from it's current designation as a Schedule 1 illegal drug (heroin is Schedule 1). End this nonsense, and commute the sentences of all nonviolent drug users currently languishing in our prisons.  

5. Finally, Mr. President, on our behalf, offer up some national humility, redemption and forgiveness. It would only be symbolic, but It may go a long way to building some bridges, fixing the mistakes of history and redeeming our American soul. How powerful it would be if you offered an official presidential apology, on behalf of the American people, to the families of civilians killed by our drones; to our Native Americans for the genocide committed upon them by our ancestors; to the people of Iraq for invading their country and destroying their society; to American women for still being permanently paid less, for still living in constant danger of violence and for still holding little power in our democracy; and to the African American community in general for a sad host of things: for continuing to suffer from the legacy of slavery and bigotry, for still occupying the lowest rung of the economic ladder, for being the pawns of our criminal justice system, for the continuing abuse from law enforcement and for whatever else is in store for them under the incoming administration. 

I know, it's a long list, but we all know how good it often feels to just say, ""I'm sorry"" -- and better yet, to follow that up with sincere action. 

Please use the pulpit -- and the power -- you still have to offer some healing, some freedom, some forgiveness -- and some clean water for a town that's been waiting three years to drink just one glass of it. 

Thanks again for all you've done. Here's to a productive and loving final week in office!

All my best,
Michael Moore",,status,,2017-01-12 09:10:52,37102,1718,6635,30911,5039,94,53,971,34

RAPID RESPONSE TEAMS
Friends - Today and tomorrow the Republicans are going to try to ram through confirmation of the worst-ever nominee for Attorney General: Alabama bigot, Jeff Sessions. He was the first -- and for a long time, the only -- Senator to endorse Donald Trump for president. Now Trump is trying to reward him by making him the head of our criminal justice system!  Your Senators MUST hear from you today (most of their offices are open between 9am and 6PM ET, but the switchboard is open 24/7 and can connect you to their voicemail). Please call the U.S. Senate at 202-225-3121 and ask to speak to one of your State's two senators (if you don't know your Senators' names, just tell the operator the State you're from and she/he will connect you directly to their offices. If you don't know the State you're from, stop reading this and unfollow me). 

Let your Senator know that you are STRONGLY opposed to Sessions being named Attorney General. He is anti-civil rights, he is opposed to the Voting Rights Act and he voted against the Matthew Shepherd gay discrimination act. 

The Senate confirmation hearing began this morning and will continue tomorrow. So you must call now. And when you are done with the first of your Senators, hang up, call  the main number back - 292-225-3131 - and ask to speak to the second Senator from your State. This has to happen NOW!

Last week, at my request, you flooded the Capitol switchboard to oppose the Republicans' attempt to close the Congressional Office of Ethics (Rep. Cleaver from Missouri said your thousands of calls were like ""an avalanche""). We succeeded in stopping them in just 3 hours! Let's do it again. 

Call/text/email/Facebook/DM your Rapid Response Team NOW. If you haven't formed a Rapid Response Team, do so this morning. All you have to do is commit to calling, texting or e-mailing an urgent notice to 5-10 of your friends, family members, neighbors, co-workers or classmates whenever an urgent matter is before us in protecting the country from an admitted sociopath. So, today, that means you and your Team calling the U.S. Senate, 202-225-3121, and telling your Senators to VOTE AGAINST Jeff Sessions for Attorney General whenever he comes up for a vote. If you get a busy signal, keep trying.

Thanks! And never forget -- he lost by 3 million votes! Our fellow Americans were very clear: They did NOT want Donald Trump as their president. WE are the majority. 
We cannot remain silent this morning as a malignant narcissist tries to anoint a man committed to white privilege as our Attorney General. 

CALL NOW: 202-225-3121. I just did.

And that's when the attempted demolition of what we hold dear in our democracy begins. 

It will happen so fast, your head may spin. They can't get actual laws enacted until they have a President who can sign them. That's 17 days away. But what they CAN do is shake up the Congressional committees and change the Congressional rules. The can eliminate Congressional governmental watchdogs and redirect Congressional spending. They can do all that and more, and they won't waste a minute doing it. Unlike our side, which operates with a Kumbaya/""Can't-we-all-get-along""/wimp-induced mentality, the Republicans are already sitting on their Panzer tanks ready to steamroll themselves through the floors of the Senate and House which they both control. 

In fact, last night, they decided not to wait for this morning's bang of the gavel and went ahead and gassed up those tanks. They got together privately and voted to gut the Congressional Office of Ethics, an independent group that oversees and guards against corrupt behavior by members of Congress. 

But we're in a different behavioral era now, where corruption and ethics can be damned. We're in the Pussy Grabbing Era, and so it makes sense that the first thing the Republicans would destroy would be the very body that is meant to guard us from... Republicans who are led by a Grabber-in-Chief. A man who doesn't even acknowledge the very idea of ethics, or conflicts of interest, or foreign meddling in our elections, or the need for the public to see his basic tax returns. 

So here we go. Less than two hours until the shit hits the fan. Are you awake? Are you ready to fight? Can you skip your latte or your donut or your checking in on how Mariah Carey is handling her New Year's Eve debacle and take just two minutes to call your member of Congress -- NOW? Let's flood their switchboard to express our outrage at the elimination of the independent ethics office. Don't let the clock strike 12 noon Eastern Time without making your voice heard!

1. Of those Americans who voted, 54% DID NOT WANT TRUMP. In addition to the nearly 3 million votes Hillary beat Trump by, another 7 million+ also rejected him by voting Green or Libertarian. That's a margin of over 10 million voters who didn't  want Trump as their president. That's huge. You must never forget that the vast majority of the people who are your neighbors and your fellow Americans are OPPOSED to a Trump presidency, they despise what he says and does, and they will not support his efforts to wreck this country. 

2. The Republicans in November LOST seats in BOTH the House and Senate. Which means the Democrats GAINED seats. Not many, but the Republican forward movement from the past two elections has been halted. We have 7 more seats in the House and 2 new seats in the Senate (for a total of 48, two short of half!). We must continue this trend in spite of the miserable failure of an institution known as the ""Democratic Party.""

3. America is still a liberal country (the majority still supports women's rights, strong environmental laws, LGBTQ rights, peace, increasing the minimum wage, etc.), and if it weren't for racist gerrymandering and voter suppression, plus an 18th-century plank in the Constitution that doesn't allow us to vote DIRECTLY for president -- a section written to appease the slave states who wanted their slaves counted to increase their individual states population (so they would then be assigned more seats in Congress and on the Electoral College) but without letting their slaves be free and vote -- we'd control Congress and the White House right now.

4. Obama has been doing some pretty incredible things lately. Pardoning and granting clemency to people who shouldn't have been jailed in the first place (please pardon more). Protecting millions of acres of undeveloped land. Standing up to Netanyahu. Behaving with grace and dignity in a way I doubt we'll see again any time soon. 

5. Locally, much good is happening. New York state is raising the minimum wage to $15/hr.  More states are decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana. Portland, OR, is taxing companies who pay their CEOs more than 100x the average worker. Bernie Sanders got 70% of the primary vote in the Michigan town where I live. I'm sure many of you can add to this list. 

6. The New York Times and the Washington Post (and a few others), in a year when the media helped create Trump and fell down on the job, inched their way back to what they used to do - real reporting. They also published a number of important stories this year that weren't about the election. Like the one in the Times about how Harvard scientists back in the '70s and '80s conspired with the sugar industry to put out false studies that said Americans must switch to a ""low-fat"" diet -- which resulted in fat in foods being replaced by sugar. Result: a country that got really fat and is now 2/3 overweight. Fat in food, it turns out, is good for you - and sugar - added sugar -  is the evil one. Somebody should do a documentary on the harm Harvard has done to the world - from Kissinger to this.  

7. On a personal note, although as a citizen I am more distraught than you can imagine, I am also happier, much healthier and have more of the fight in me than ever before. I fought for Bernie, fought hard to stop Trump, and when he won at 2:40am on 11/9, I immediately started to help organize the resistance. I had in 2016, for the first time ever, two movies released in one year. I'm fired up and ready with some great ideas for 2017. And I'm committed to my daily walks. With you, if you'd like to join, from wherever you are. 

I'd also love to hear about the good things that happened to you in 2016.

So, before we move too far into 2017, let's raise a glass to the good that came out of 2016. We're going to need all the positive reinforcement we can muster in the coming year. Well, actually the coming hours. The new all-Republican 115th session of Congress gets sworn in tomorrow. And, like the sociopath who is their party's leader, they will commence their scorched earth policy without a blink of the eye. Take what you can from 2016 and together we can perhaps pull off what tonight seems impossible.

GM turned off the heat and water and tried to starve them out. The workers prevailed and families like mine after this were able, for the first time, to make a livable wage, enjoy what was called a ""weekend,"" see a doctor, own a home, buy a car, send the next generation to college. This victory in Flint spread to other cities and other industries and soon working people who were willing to take a stand had a better life. Of course, this would not last more than 5 decades or so as future generations of workers forgot how what they had was originally obtained, taking for granted that their free health care, their generous pensions, their month-long paid vacations and the sort would somehow be there in perpetuity. Before long Wall Street and the banks and the elites found ways to chip away at all those ""benefits."" The Democratic Party, sworn to defend the working class as Roosevelt had on the streets of Flint, grew weak and ineffectual and beholden in some part to the corporate class. By the end of the 20th century, the wages were stagnant or slashed, the benefits eliminated and the government assisted big business in efforts to find cheaper sources of labor overseas. Flint went from being a workers paradise to one of the poorest, most desperate cities in the country. Half the population was able to escape into a diaspora of low-wage states, while the other poorer, Blacker half was left behind -- only to eventually be poisoned by the water a ruthless Republican governor made them drink. My uncle and his brothers and sisters and entire family would not recognize this New Year's Eve as we enter 2017, be it in Flint or throughout the rest of Trump's America. ""Trumpmerica.""

24674986856_10154046637756857,"5 Things You Can Do Right Now About Donald J. Trump - from Michael Moore 

It's been seven weeks since Hillary beat Trump by nearly 3 million votes but lost the presidency to him. So if your head is still spinning from that mindf***, or you can't quite believe a malignant narcissist will now sit in the Oval Office, or if you are simply still working your way through the 17 stages of grief, then I am here to say to you, ""There's no crying in TrumpLand -- Let's get to work!"" All hands on deck! Brush your yourself off and let's get busy because: a) All hope is not lost; b) There are more of us than there are of them; and c) The roadside is littered with the ended careers of self-absorbed, narcissistic politicians whose arrogance led them to do things that caused their early resignation or impeachment. Don't think that can't happen here. 

I do not say these things because I am filled with optimism. In fact, I think the first thing we all have to do in order to move on is to admit out loud what we already think privately: As bad as we know it's going to be, it's actually going to be worse. A lot worse. Now cheer up and read on...

THE FIVE THINGS EACH OF US MUST DO THIS WEEK

1. MAKE YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN. Your Senators and Members of Congress are home right now, in your town (or a nearby town), for their holiday break. Their office is open! You don't need an appointment. Just show up (to find out where the local office is click here: http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ and type in your zip code). Go there (take a friend!), walk in and say ""I'm a constituent and I'd like a few minutes with my Congressman/woman."" He/she may be busy, so tell them you'd like to speak to someone on the staff for a couple minutes. Most local congressional offices are LOATHE to turn anyone away because to them you are that one vote who could vote them out of office. Tell the person you get to speak to why you want the Congressman to block all the damage Trump is going to do (cite examples). If he/she is a Republican, they will explain why they ""support the new President."" You then must politely tell them you and everyone you know will work to unseat them in 2018 if they don't act independently from Trump. The calmer and cooler you say this, the more they will believe it. If your rep is a Democrat, tell him/her that you expect them to AGGRESSIVELY fight the Trump agenda -- and if they don't, you will work with others to support a true progressive in the Democratic primary in 2018. Tell them that millions of us will do what the Tea Party did to the Republicans: primary them and toss them out of office. Say it politely, thank them, then leave. You actually showing up in person to do this is as powerful as 100 letters or a large demonstration on the street in front of their office. Do this and post it on social media. Post it on my Facebook or Twitter and I'll try to re-post/tweet as many as I can.

2. WRITE TO THE DNC TONIGHT. It will take 5 minutes. Send a quick email to the Democratic National Committee (http://my.democrats.org/page/s/contact-the-democrats) and tell them you want them to elect Congressman Keith Ellison as the new chairperson of the Democratic Party. He is the future and everyone else is the past. Here's what the old guard gave us: TWICE in 16 years the Democratic candidate WON the vote for President but LOST the White House. Incredible! This has to stop! Ellison and the progressive wing of the party must take us forward. Keith has the backing of Bernie Sanders and myself, but also the endorsement of some of the old guard who've come around to see the error of past ways (Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, etc.). In addition to being born in Detroit, spending his adulthood as a community organizer and now representing the Twin Cities in the House, Ellison is also the only Muslim member of Congress. He was one of the few members of Congress brave enough to back Bernie. He will fight to turn this around and, as a son of the Midwest, bring that part of the country back from the dark side. Let's flood the DNC with emails tonight (and cc: the your state Democratic Party, too - you can look up their email address on Google).

3. FORM YOUR OWN RAPID RESPONSE TEAM. By New Year's Day this Sunday, I want you to ask 5 to 10 friends, family members, co-workers, classmates or neighbors to be part of your Rapid Response Team. Pick a name for it -- the ""Doyle Family Rapid Response Team"", the ""Oak Street Rapid Response Team"", the ""Seabrook High School Rapid Response Team"", the ""Gilmore Girls Fan Club Rapid Response Team"", etc. Set a plan to contact each other online as soon as word goes out on any given day to oppose what Trump and Congress are up to. Your Rapid Response Team will agree with each other to email elected reps, make calls, post on social media, go to protests and/or organize others at work, school or in the neighborhood.  Through my own social media sites, as stuff happens, I will send out instructions immediately as to what we all must do. Sign up now to follow me on my Facebook (facebook.com/mmflint) and Twitter (twitter.com/mmflint) if you don't already. Form your team this week. I'm personally organizing a Rapid Response Team in the apartment building where I live. We need to get prepared and be ready now. If we wait til late January to organize, it will be too late. 

4. MAKE PLANS NOW TO BE AT THE INAUGURATION WEEKEND PROTESTS! We need millions in the streets in DC -- and that's what it looks like it's shaping up to be. The big march will be the day after the Inauguration - the Million Women March on January 21st. Click here for details https://www.facebook.com/events/2169332969958991/. On January 20th - Inauguration Day - a call has been gone out to non-violently disrupt the proceedings. Go to http://www.disruptj20.org/ and learn about civil disobedience on that day. Planes and trains are already selling out, as are hotels. Contact the above sites to get info on buses and housing (or charter your own bus from your town). Everyone who can should be there. If you can't make it, find (or organize) a local protest in your area. Take the day off. No one should be silent that day.

5. YOU SHOULD RUN FOR OFFICE. Yes, YOU. Why not? Who else do you think is going to do it? I'm not saying you have to be the next Senator from Michigan, but why not run for State Rep. or school board or city council? At the very least, run for precinct delegate in the local Democratic Party. It's time to stop carping about politicians and become one. But a different kind of one! I ran for and got elected to the school board at 18-years old. Form your campaign committee now for the elections in 2017 and 2018. (If you need me, I'll even offer to be your honorary chair!) You know you can do this. We have no choice. We've left it up to others - yes, Democrats - and they are inept and continual losers. Haven't you had enough? Run for office, any office!

There you go. 5 Easy Pieces. Start tonight. And spread this around. ALL HANDS ON DECK!

Tonight it's Christmas Eve, it's Hanukkah, it's a month before the words ""Muslim registry"" will find their way into an actual law, and it's just another night for the ""nonbelievers"" (the only group who's probably going to save us because they believe in science, facts and humanity - the last one in spite of itself).

Many of us are with friends and family tonight. Many are alone. We seek peace and kindness and compassion for all - but we are not blind (at least, for some, not any longer). 

We know the wall of hate in front of us is going to seem insurmountable. It is not. It is built on falsehoods and ignorance and the instilling of fear -- and these tricks, history has shown us, while they cause much damage in the short term, are in the long run met with defeat. Just ask The South, the Germans or Roger Ailes. 

There's no way to sugarcoat the true breadth of the tsunami that's about to hit us. Although we don't control a single branch of our disappearing democracy, we ARE the majority (by nearly three million votes!) and we have MANY tools available to us (mass protest, civil disobedience, lawsuits, social media, old media, and just plain showing up) that we can use to grind the gears of this madness to a near-halt.  

I and others will keep you informed and you and I and all of us will lead the charge. I will continue to post things you can do where you live. The only way this will work is if everyone commits, right now, to doing something, anything, in the coming year. That can be our Christmas/Hanukkah/Muslim registry gift to each other - I'm in, you're in, we're all in. Everybody in the pool! Share your real presents with each other tonight, tomorrow and in the coming year - the gifts of decency, love, caring, listening, living with less, doing for others, raising your voice and using the car pool lane because you and your four friends are on your way to disrupt the building of that wall.

Enjoy this weekend, be good to yourself and remember that ""Celebrity Apprentice"" returns to NBC on January 2nd, 9pm Eastern and Pacific, 8pm Central (so you can maybe figure out how we all ended up in this shitshow in the first place). 

And thank you baby Jesus -- sorry for how it's all turned out.

2. Hillary Clinton won the election on Nov 8 by 2.8 million votes over Donald Trump. Which is to say, she lost. You are correct, this is not a democracy. 

3. Back in the 1700s, in order to get the slave states to join the USA, the founders gave those states ""extra votes"", letting them count their slaves but not let them vote.

Dear Republican Electors:

Ok, if you've read this far, knowing that it's me, Michael Moore, writing to you -- well, thank you for having an open mind and the willingness to listen to someone you don't agree with. 

I am writing you not as a card-carrying Democrat (I'm not) who voted for Hillary (I did), but simply because I am an American who, like you, deeply loves this country and its people. 

Tomorrow is the day you are supposed to gather with your fellow electors and choose the next President of the United States. I am not going to ask you to vote for the person who got the most votes (although I will not be upset should you chose to side with the majority of your fellow Americans and do so!).

No, I'm simply asking you to vote your conscience and PLEASE do not put our nation in danger by choosing Donald J. Trump.

I know you HAVE to be full of worry and consternation over the way Russia hacked into our election in order to help Trump. Shouldn't we all wait until the investigation ordered by the president is finished before the Electoral College votes? If Trump did know or was involved in this unprecedented assault on our electoral process, wouldn't that be enough for you to exercise your constitutional power to stop a man like this from taking office? 

Or just the fact that he has refused to attend nearly all the daily national security briefings -- doesn't this give you some pause? Do we want a Commander-in-Chief who is too busy or too disinterested to protect us on a daily basis?  

Or how about the fact that Donald Trump bragged and admitted during the campaign that his people were in touch with the Russians? How much more do you need before you get a sick feeling about all of this?

I think you know something is wrong with this man. He just doesn't seem ""right."" One crazy comment or action after another. He may not be well. Don't you have a responsibility to protect us from someone who might be mentally unstable? 

I want you to know what the law says about what you can do tomorrow. Please check out these links: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-constitution-lets-the-electoral-college-choose-the-winner-they-should-choose-clinton/2016/11/24/0f431828-b0f7-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html?utm_term=.3902455d0ce3 and http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp

You have more power than you realize -- and you have an American conscience I hope you will follow. Please consider there four points:

1. Although it may ultimately have to be decided by the courts, right now you have the duty to do what you feel is right. One reason the founders set up the Electoral College was to make sure there was one final protection should someone who is a danger to the country slip through. We've established the national security danger that is Donald Trump and the possibility he had knowledge of the Russians hacking our election while it was taking place. If I were an elector for Hillary and learned she MIGHT have received helped from the Russians or the North Koreans or the Saudis, how do you think I'd be voting tomorrow? I assure you, it would not be for Hillary. You need to do the same thing.  

2. But some states have made it ""illegal"" for you to vote any other way than for Trump. If you don't vote for him, your state will fine you $1,000. So here's my offer to you: I obviously can't and won't give you money to vote tomorrow, but if you do vote your conscience and you are punished for it, I will personally step up pay your fine which is my legal right to do. 

3. If you are still worried about the legality of you voting your conscience and would like free legal advice and help, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig has offered to be your lawyer. Contact him at: http://www.electorstrust.org/

4. Trump, as I'm sure deep down in your heart you know, is never going to last the four years. He doesn't care about the law or following the rules and this will eventually trip him up. You know how dangerous it is when any politician, Democrat or Republican, who's a super narcissist is elected to office, they start making decisions that personally benefit themselves -- and before you know it, they're being hauled off to jail. Why not vote tomorrow for someone who's going to finish her/his term? Why risk the volatile presence of Donald Trump in the White House -- and help to guarantee another generation of Dems in the Oval Office?!

Republican electors, you have a chance tomorrow to fix this, to make it right, for yourselves as Republicans and for the country. Please find the courage to seize this historic moment where you put country over party. Set an example to our young people that conscience supersedes politics, and that morality -- yes, answering the quite legitimate question, ""what would Jesus do?"" -- is still the most important consideration. You are bound to God and not to Vladimir Putin. Your loyalty is to your fellow Americans, the vast majority of whom didn't vote for Donald J. Trump. But you won the Electoral College and so you get to decide. You can vote for the actual winner as decided by the American people, or you can pick another Republican who isn't Trump.

Why not choose a president who won't try to please Moscow, someone who believes the threat of terrorism is real and demands to be briefed on it daily? Why not let history record your moment of true courage and patriotism? Only 38 of you have to stand up and say, ""I love my country and I cannot in good conscience vote for a man who, whether he means to or not, may put our nation in jeopardy. I love my country more than I love this job as an elector.""

Thank you for listening to my plea. I promise to return the favor someday. A lot more listening to each other, regardless of our political positions, could go a long way to truly making America great again. 

Most sincerely,
Michael Moore

Yesterday was the day Donald Trump was going to hold his first press conference in 5 months. He abruptly cancelled it on Monday with no explanation. Well, I have one...

He has heard that there is a rumbling taking place amongst the Republican electors that some of them are growing uncomfortable with the news that the election was hacked by Russia to benefit him. This news was followed by the revelation that Putin himself directed the hack. And then last night, CBS News reported that the Russians had in the past committed a successful cyber-attack on the email system of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

If you are a Republican Elector, this news is very sobering. And for some, very disturbing. 

Electors of the Electoral College know that their job is to usually rubber stamp the election - with one exception: If they need to cast their vote to protect the country from someone who is a danger to our nation. 

And slowly it has dawned on some of the electors this week that something doesn't smell right. And now that we know that Putin himself was behind this historic assault on our electoral process -- so that he could tilt the election to Trump -- well, this is now for many Americans a bridge too far. 

Trump knows this, so he's gone into hiding from real journalists. He has one mission right now: Get to Monday without the shit hitting the fan. To show you how scared he is, after my (and others) week-long shaming him for not showing up to the daily national security briefing, his aides have responded by announcing that he'll start attending the briefings ""three"" times a week. As for the other four days, I guess it's, ""Sorry America -- you're on your own!"" But he knew he had to do something. This is the Trumpian way of ""doing something.""

Well, WE need to do something. All of us, very loudly, need to let the Electoral College know that they MUST vote their conscience on Monday. Or postpone the vote until they have more information about Trump's Manchurian Candidate-like behavior. Here is a site you can go to to find out what's going on protest-wise where you live over the weekend and on Monday: http://www.hamiltonelectors.com/events

What would Trump and the Republicans be doing today if they were ahead by 3 million votes - but the Electoral College was set to give the Presidency to Clinton? Are you kidding? THEY WOULD NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. 

We are the wimps. We sink into our despair. We feel defeated and that there's nothing we can do. Everybody told us she was going to win! Nate Silver and 538 promised us it was in the bag! All the pundits agreed!! 

Get over it and pull yourself together. ""The tanks are 20 miles outside of Paris!"" Throw everything you got at this and do not relent. You're in the friggin' majority! Let's act like it. Make your voice heard on social media and in front of your state capitol. An authoritarian regime is about to take hold in DC, and they are going to run roughshod over you, me and all that is good. Get over your election depression and fight like you've never fought before. Non-violently. With conviction. There are more of us than there are of them. Only 23% of all registered adult American voters showed up and voted for Trump. Come on! It's not over til it's over.

by Michael Moore

A week has gone by since Donald Trump admitted he's only been to ""two or three"" of his daily presidential national security briefings. There have been 36 of them since the day he secured enough electoral college votes to be appointed president next Monday when the Electoral College meets. 

Most would agree the #1 job of the leader of any country is to keep its people safe. There is no more important meeting every day for the President than the one where he learns what the day's potential threats are to the country. That Trump would find it too cumbersome or too annoying to have to sit through 20 minutes of listening to his top intelligence people tell him who's trying to kill us today, simply boggles the mind. 

Of course, our minds have been so boggled so many times in the past year by this foolish man no one seems that surprised or concerned. He can get up at 5 in the morning and send angry, childish tweets about how he's being portrayed on SNL (""Not funny! Unwatchable!""), or belittling the local elected union leader in Indiana, but he doesn't have time to hear about the threats to our national security. 

So, my fellow Americans, when the next terrorist attack happens -- and it will happen, we all know that -- and after the tragedy is over, amidst the death and destruction that might have been prevented, you will see Donald Trump acting quickly to blame everyone but himself. He will suspend constitutional rights. He will round up anyone he deems a threat. He will declare war, and his Republican Congress will back him. 

And no one will remember that he wasn't paying attention to the growing threat. Wasn't attending the daily national security briefings. Was playing golf instead or meeting with celebrities or staying up til 3am tweeting about how unfair CNN is. He said he didn't need to be briefed. ""You know, I think I'm smart. I don't need to hear the same thing over and over each day for eight years."" That's what he told Fox News on December 11th when asked why he wasn't attending the security briefings. Don't forget that date and his hubris as we bury the dead next year.

We had a president like him before. He, too, lost the popular vote, a majority of Americans saying they didn't want him in the Oval Office. But his governor/brother and his ex-CIA chief/dad's appointees to the Supreme Court put an end to that, and he was installed as Commander-in-Chief. On August 6, 2001, he was on a month-long vacation at his ranch in Texas. That morning, the White House Counsel handed him his daily national security briefing. He glanced at it, set it aside and then went fishing for the rest of the day. Below is the photo of that moment which I showed the world in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". The headline on the security briefing reads: BIN LADEN DETERMINED TO STRIKE INSIDE U.S. On the top page it tells how bin Laden will do this: with planes. George W. Bush didn't leave the ranch to go back to work for the next four weeks. In the fifth week, bin Laden attacked the US with planes on September 11th. 

It's one thing to have a president who was asleep at the wheel. But, my friends, it's a whole other thing to now have a president-elect who REFUSES TO EVEN GET BEHIND THE WHEEL! This utter neglect of duty, a daily snub at the people who work to protect us, the first Commander-in-Chief to literally be AWOL and announcing proudly he isn't going to change -- this, I assure you, is going to get a lot of innocent people killed. 

To you, Mr. Trump, I say this: When this next terrorist attack takes place, it is YOU who will be charged by the American people with a gross dereliction of duty. It was YOUR job to pay attention, to protect the country. But you were too busy tweeting and defending Putin and appointing cabinet members to dismantle the government. You didn't have time for the daily national security briefing. Don't think we're going to let you use a modern-day burning of the Reichstag as your excuse to eliminate our civil liberties and our democracy. 

We will remember that while the plot to kill Americans was being hatched, your time was consumed by whom you saw as the real threat to America: Alec Baldwin in a wig.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/photos/a.10150288227701857.331023.24674986856/10154007461821857/?type=3,2016-12-13 21:10:29,67949,6384,43188,49261,1053,1198,219,6056,10162

24674986856_10153966307896857,"Dear President Obama:

Today two orphans will come to knock on your door. They are grown men now, accomplished in their own fields, raised by another family, with families now of their own. 

They are coming to ask you for mercy for their mother. Ethel Rosenberg was their mother. She was executed in 1953 for a crime she did not commit. Executed by the United States Government. In our name, a woman, a mother was murdered. Everyone now admits she never did what she was accused of doing. That the government concocted false evidence and witnesses to convict her. This wrongful execution was a crime committed in our name, by our government, during a time of Red Scares and those in power manipulating the fears of an American public who have always been so easy to manipulate. Get us scared about anything and we are quick to fall into line and do what we are told. 

Ethel Rosenberg was a victim of this mass hysteria, this ""scoundrel time"" as Lillian Hellman called it. 

Mr. President, it is now time to right this wrong. It is time to exonerate Ethel Rosenberg. 

Her sons, Michael and Robert Meeropol, are hoping to see you today. Please see them. Please accept the petition that I and 40,000 others have signed -- and I now ask everyone reading this to sign it also: www.rfc.org/ethel. 

Here's what the Boston Globe had to say on the matter last week when they called upon you to heed this call and exonerate her: https://www.bostonglobe.com/op inion/editorials/2016/11/23/fo r-ethel-rosenberg-presidential -pardon/Hh7NyQed8ZIRSaueBqnadK /story.html

Do the right thing, Mr. Obama. Issue a proclamation exonerating Ethel Rosenberg. And everyone reading this, please click here and sign the petition: www.rfc.org/ethel.

Thank you, Mr. President, for doing this and for all you have done.

24674986856_10153951579621857,"THE Discussion to Have on Thanksgiving: How We Stop Trump (just let the racist at the table eat more stuffing) - from Michael Moore:

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Yes, there's so much to be thankful for these days -- and I'll give you that list as soon as I can come up something beyond 1) we're alive, 2) the sun rose in the east this morning, and 3) this adorable video of a baby who stole an iPhone while it was recording https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ3Roar7J7Q&sns=em 

But seriously, we're all getting ready to sit down for Thanksgiving dinner in a few minutes and, well, in many homes (i.e., white homes), we're perhaps facing World War III at the table. There's the misogynist uncle, the racist cousin, the Libertarian brother-in-law and, yes, your own dear mother who was one of the 46% of women who somehow inexplicably voted for Trump. They're all coming to the table now and you are going to do your best to keep your cool. 

Or not. Maybe this is actually a good time to say, ""I love you, I'm so glad we're all family, and I don't want to argue politics today. Instead, if you don't mind, the majority of us here at the table - just like the majority of the country - voted for Hillary, so we're going to talk amongst ourselves for a few minutes about what we need to do to stop Trump in the coming weeks and months.""

And then start talking with each other about what we need to do. Here's 5 things to discuss:

1. We can't wait until January 20th to fight back. That has to start NOW. Start with this mantra: ""He Shall Not Enter the Oval Office!"" I know. A crazy thought. But crazy times demand crazy thoughts!Stop listening to the ""rational adults"" who keep saying ""the electoral college is the law!"" So was forcing Blacks to sit at the back of the bus. I know this seems impossible at this point. But so was convincing the all-male legislatures in three dozen states to give women the right to vote. So was the Cubs winning the World Series. Sometimes miracles do happen. Why not start with that hope/dream/delusion? It's better than doing nothing -- and sometimes a Hail Mary pass works.   

2. Form your own Rapid Response Team with your family and friends, in your neighborhood, at work, or at school. 5 to 30 people (times a million) who will demand a recount in the close states, get their states to pass the National Popular Vote law http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/, appeal to the electors of the electoral college to abide by the popular vote (or their conscience) and demonstrate, demonstrate, demonstrate! 

3. During the holiday break, make a plan now take some friends and visit the local office of your member of Congress to give him/her a piece of your mind. Tell them - especially the Democrats -  that if they don't aggressively oppose what Trump plans to do you will work with others to run a progressive against them in the 2018 primary -- just like the Tea Party did to the Republicans they tossed out in 2010-2014. 

4. Each of you write to the Democratic National Committee today https://my.democrats.org/page/s/contact and tell them the DNC needs new leadership. Support Rep. Keith Ellison's bid to become chair of the party https://www.thenation.com/article/keith-ellison-is-the-leader-the-dnc-needs/.

5. Make a plan right now at the dinner table that we're all going to Washington, DC, on Inauguration Day (Friday, January 20th) to protest the ascendancy of a narcissistic sociopath who lost the vote for the highest office in the land. Millions are going to show up to say NO to what he's planning to do. Let's all plan to get in the car (or buy a cheap plane/bus ticket) and be there! Who's driving? Aunt Betty? Cousin Camille? Joey, you pay for the gas! Everybody in the car! 

There! We did something other than eat stuffing and argue! We were Americans on this American holiday! Now, stop ignoring the Trump voters at the table and go back to talking about something they're interested in, like beating the crowds on Black Friday. (It also gives you a chance to say the word ""Black"" just one more time).

The conversation got so intense, so powerful that it's host, Joe Scarborough, kept waving off one commercial break after another. I was allowed a television luxury -- the chance to express my thoughts in complete paragraphs instead of in sound bytes. This lasted for 45 uninterrupted  glorious minutes! The control booth apparently was going crazy.  Joe blew off all commercials. ""We've never done that before,"" said the producer.  ""That was the longest segment ever in the history of this show."" 

""Epic,"" said the stage manager. 

When it was over they said they would bring their show to Flint. 

Thank you Joe & Mika. I've never seen a host kill 5 commercial breaks before!

24674986856_10153915876426857,"Day Two's To-Do List:
1. Must quickly and decisively form an opposition movement, the likes of which hasn't been seen since the 1960s. I will do my part to help lead this as I'm sure many others (Bernie, Elizabeth Warren, MoveOn, the hip-hop community, DFA, etc.) will, too. The core of this opposition force will be fueled by young people who, as with Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, don't tolerate b.s. and are relentless in their resistance to authority. They have no interest in compromising with racists and misogynists.

2. Prepare to impeach Trump. Just as the Republicans were already planning to do with President Hillary from Day One, we must organize the apparatus that will bring charges against him when he violates his oath and breaks the law -- and then we must remove him from office.

3. Must commit right now to a vigorous fight (including civil disobedience, if necessary) which will block any and all Donald Trump Supreme Court nominees who do not meet our approval. We demand the Democrats in the Senate aggressively filibuster any nominees who support Citizens United or who oppose the rights of women, immigrants and the poor. This is non-negotiable. 

4. Demand the DNC apologize to Bernie Sanders for trying to fix the primaries against him, for spinning the press to ignore his historic campaign, for giving Clinton the questions in advance at the Flint debate, for its latent ageism and anti-Semism in trying to turn voters against him because of his age or religious beliefs, and for its anti-democracy system of ""superdelegates"" who are elected by no one. We all know now had Bernie been given a fair shot, he probably would have been the nominee and he -- as the true outsider and ""change"" candidate --would have inspired and fired up the base and soundly defeated Donald Trump. If no apology is soon forthcoming from the DNC, that's ok -- when we take over the Democratic Party (see yesterday's To-Do List, #1), we will issue the apology in person. 

5. Demand that President Obama establish a Special Prosecutor to investigate who and what was behind FBI Director James Comey's illegal interference into the Presidential election 11 days before the vote was held. 

6. Begin a national push while it's fresh in everyone's mind for a constitutional amendment to fix our broken electoral system: 1. Eliminate the Electoral College -- popular vote only. 2. Paper ballots only -- no electronic voting. 3. Election Day must be made a holiday for all -- or held on a weekend so more people vote.  4. All citizens, regardless of any run-ins with the criminal ""justice"" system, must have the right to vote. (In swing states like Florida and Virginia, 30-40% of all Black men are prohibited by law from voting.)

7. Convince President Obama to immediately do what he should have done a year ago: Send in the Army Corps of Engineers to Flint to dig up and replace all the poisoned pipes. NOTHING HAS CHANGED; the water in Flint is still unusable. 

Will try to get these done by sundown. More To-Do tomorrow...

24674986856_10153913074756857,"Morning After To-Do List:
1. Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably. 
2. Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn't let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. Those same bloviators will now tell us we must ""heal the divide"" and ""come together."" They will pull more hooey like that out of their ass in the days to come. Turn them off. 
3. Any Democratic member of Congress who didn't wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that's about to begin. 
4. Everyone must stop saying they are ""stunned"" and ""shocked"". What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren't paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all ""You're fired!"" Trump's victory is no surprise. He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that. 
5. You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: ""HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!"" The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don't. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump. The only reason he's president is because of an arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College. Until we change that, we'll continue to have presidents we didn't elect and didn't want. You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there's climate change, they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don't want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed. We live in a country where the majority agree with the ""liberal"" position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen (see: #1 above).

MICHAEL MOORE, JESSE JACKSON TO HOLD ELECTION EVE 'GET OUT THE VOTE' RALLY IN FLINT, MI

RALLY WIll INCLUDE FREE SCREENING OF MOORE'S ""TRUMPLAND"" FILM 

(FLNIT, MI Nov. 6, 2016) With a tightened race now seeming to come down to the battleground state of Michigan, Oscar-winning filmmaker and Flint-native Michael Moore has announced he will hold a ""raucous, impassioned"" election eve rally and free screening of his new film ""Michael Moore In TrumpLand"" at Flint's Whiting Auditorium on Monday evening. 

And coming as Moore's special guest will be none other than civil rights icon and former Presidential candidate Rev. Jesse Jackson.

""The fact that Donald Trump is within striking distance of winning the state of Michigan is a wake-up call to all decent people,"" said Moore, a prominent Bernie Sanders supporter who has been an outspoken Clinton backer in the general election. ""We must have a significant turnout on Tuesday for Hillary in order to repudiate the hate from the Trump campaign and move Flint and the country forward.""

""I am honored to join Michael Moore and return to Flint, a city that has gripped the conscience of a nation on more than one occasion,"" said Rev. Jackson. ""No one must stay home this Tuesday. To do so would dishonor all who have come before us.""

Moore, who has historically held gala premiers and screenings of each of his films at The Whiting, is hosting this screening of his latest documentary as part of a ""get out the vote"" effort in Michigan that on Monday will see Hillary Clinton visiting Grand Rapids, Bill Clinton speaking in Lansing and President Obama appearing at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Trump has also announced he will close out his campaign tomorrow night in Michigan. 

Moore, in addition to showing his 73-minute film on the big screen at The Whiting, will also speak, as will Jesse Jackson along with a number of other invited guests. Moore says there many even be ""a little surprise"" at the event. In the past, those little surprises have included Moore bringing on the stage Roseanne Barr, Phil Donahue and members of Rage Against the Machine.

Moore first brought Rev. Jackson to Flint in 1984 in an effort to elect Flint's first elected African American mayor. The rally was successful in helping James Sharp win that election two days later. 

In 1988, Moore again brought Presidential candidate jackson to Michigan to campaign during that year's presidential primary. The effort was again successful as Jackson won the Michigan primary, defeating Michael Dukakis. 

""Jesse is our good luck charm, for sure!"" Moore added. ""We will settle for nothing less this week.""

""Michael Moore In TrumpLand"" is a surprise new film that Moore made over 12 days in Ohio just last month. It immediately shot to #1 on iTunes nationwide and has remained there. Theatrically it is playing in 61 cities and set the all-time opening day box office record at its premiere theater in New York City. It holds the largest opening weekend per-screen average of any documentary in North America for 2016. 

The film covers Moore performing a one-man show he wrote for the people in the Republican-dominated town of Wilmington, Ohio. Critics have called it one of his best and the New Yorker magazine called it ""majectic."" 

The Whiting rally will begin at 7pm on Monday and is free and open to the public. Tickets will be handed out beginning at 11am Monday morning at the Whiting box office. 

""I hope to see a few thousand people in Flint show up,"" said Moore. ""No city in America knows better what happens when Republican policies are set in motion to harm people. Hillary was the first candidate to come to Flint and speak out against the disastrous decisions that were made which poisoned the city's water supply. She has repeatedly made it clear that Flint and its people will be at the top of her agenda."" 

Congressman Dan Kildee will also speak.

I hope you've had a wonderful 69th birthday today. I didn't send you a card, so I thought I'd post this facebook note instead.

Thank you for running, for offering to serve us for the next four to eight years. This is the time of life most would rather enjoy retirement, the grandkids or a good book. You've chosen to deal with Congress, ISIS and the melting ice caps. So, thanks for that.

This country was born 240 years and four months ago. Only men have run it. Some of them did a good job, a lot of them didn't. And now we are approaching the moment when a man will no longer lead. This will be a good thing. Better yet, that new leader, God and Ohio-willing, will be you. 

I hope someone baked you a cake. The rest of us, we're ready to place a lot on your plate. We have no choice. There's so much to be done. Please don't let down the millions turning out for you. They want peace not war, they want you to side with them and not Wall Street. They want you to feel it in your bones that black lives matter and that we are a loving home for immigrants. They know our own police have killed more Americans than ISIS has. They want to be safe but know our biggest threat are the 350 million unregistered guns in our homes. They want paid maternity leave, equal pay for women and debt-free college -- and they want the rich to pay for it, simply by paying the taxes the rich always used to pay. They want the planet to survive and they want an end to these endless elections. 

Not too much, right? Happy birthday, Hillary. Have a good sleep tonight. We'll see you tomorrow - just a dozen days left until history is made!

24674986856_10153829975081857,"Trump Is Not the Only Grabber Who Must Go

The rats are quickly jumping from the sinking ship of Trump. But not so fast, dear Republican senators and congressmen. Trump may have verbalized his misogyny, sexism and abuse of women into an open microphone, but over the past decades you - YOU - have LEGALIZED it. He may talk of ""grabbing""  sexual organs, but YOU have created laws that legally grab control over women's bodies. Trump may brag about his power over women; YOU, the Republican legislators (and your backers, the Christian Right and rich businessmen), have made sure women aren't paid the same as men, don't have paid maternity leave, or can't get easy access to birth control.

Trump has been called ""disgusting"" for his remarks. But you, by actually blocking women's equal rights, you've been rewarded for your misogyny with re-election, campaign cash and future lobbying jobs. You think by disowning Trump now that we, the people, are going be grateful to you. But we know that Trump is only the natural result of a Republican culture that has viciously fought the women's agenda for years. Trump hasn't destroyed your party; he's your end game, the grim reaper from the seeds you have sown, showing up now to preside over your demise. Defeating Trump, or pushing him to drop out, is NOT what will make this right for the majority of us Americans. Like any good doctor, we need to remove the cancer from its source, and that source is you. 

Don't try to make Mike Pence out to be some sane, better alternative. This guy was behind the legislation to require women who have an abortion to hold an actual funeral for the fetus! The rest of you have tried to kill Planned Parenthood and many other things that make life a bit easier for women. 

Trump bragged to Billy Bush about his ""grabbing pussy."" But those of you who are the elected officials, who have spent this weekend decrying Trump with your crocodile wails of ""shame"" and trying to distance yourselves from him, YOU are the ones who've been ""grabbing"" women the legal way by passing laws that, in effect, assault them. It is an assault to pay women less. It is an assault to block day care for all. It is an assault - and a form of gender apartheid - when only 20% of Congress is women, the majority gender. 

As far as I'm concerned, there are 54 Trumps in the US Senate and 237 Trumps in the House. You can't make this look good by removing your endorsement from Trump. Yes, Trump has to go -- but so do you, all of you. Starting with the election on November 8th, we need to show up at the polls and remove as many of you as possible. This abuse of women stops now. I believe that most women and many men are going to determine their vote with this one thought, thanks to you and Trump:

   ""YOU'RE EITHER WITH WOMEN, OR YOU'RE AGAINST THEM."" 

And if you're against women, you're over. There's a fourth wave of feminism afoot now -- and you are going to be its first casualties. 

Or, as I prefer to see it, its first victory. 

Thank you for letting the American public see your true (orange) face. I'm glad you ""grabbed"" our attention and mobIlized the masses against you. The only thing sweeter than seeing the lot of you gone would be a 50-state sweep for Hillary.

GOP, RIP?

I'm coming to the historic Murphy Theater in the small Republican town of Wilmington, Ohio, next week to perform and film my one-man show -- and I want to invite you to come and be in the audience! The dates are Thursday, October 6 and Friday, October 7, both nights at 8pm. You can get your FREE tickets here: www.tblus.com/moore

Wilmington is situated half-way between Columbus and Cincinnati in Clinton County -- but don't let the name of the county fool you! There are 25,000 registered voters in Clinton County - and only 500 of them are registered Democrats! Four times as many people came out to vote here for Donald Trump in this year's primary than voted for Hillary Clinton.  

So why am I coming to Trump Country in Clinton County? Because I think I know why a lot of people in Ohio and Michigan, some of them my neighbors, are voting for Donald Trump -- good Midwestern people whose lives have been upended by ""the system that's been rigged against them."" They used to be part of something that was called ""the middle class."" Now they have a chance to hit back, to pick up a virtual baseball bat and smash that old system by voting for the outsider known as Trump. I want to talk to these voters. I want to see if I can meet them half-way. And I want to give them an hour or so of some good laughs over the craziest election year we've ever seen. 

So, if you live in the area, bring your friends or family members who are leaning toward Trump to my show. They will be welcomed with open arms -- and they'll be treated to what I think will be a real surprise. At the very least, they'll have a fun night out in Wilmington, OH -- the birthplace of the banana split! 

And let me offer my thanks to the people at the Murphy Theatre in Wilmington who, unlike the town of Newark, OH, up in Licking County, not only didn't bar me from renting their beautiful facility, they wanted it known that they believe in free speech. One of the main patrons who helped restore the Murphy a few years ago was none other that Glenn Beck. He's even broadcast his show from the very stage I'll be standing on. Does that help give you some context? I'm deep in the heart of it here and I couldn't be happier. This will be unlike anything I've ever done - and I'm going to film it and get it out there to all the rest of you in the middle of October. 

Click here for tickets: www.tblus.com/moore Bring your conservative brother-in-law -- just think of the fun you'll have at this year's Thanksgiving dinner recapping the night the two of you spent with me over a banana split in little Wilmington, Ohio!

Here are my thoughts: 

It always amazes me when people choose to just outright lie instead of simply admitting the truth and then being proud of their decision. I'm sure the good people who run this theater are not, in their hearts, proud of what they've done and were certainly hoping their little act of censorship wouldn't be known by anyone. They probably didn't think we'd bother to out them so publicly. That's how small towns get away with stuff like this. And if you grew up in one of these places, you know what I'm talking about. 

Well, the truth is out now. There's no escaping it. Making up excuses like it was a logistical or timing problem -- when it would be so easy to go back and look at your records to see how you never had a problem renting your place to anyone else -- only makes it harder for you to walk this back and regain your integrity. Now you'll have to make up more stuff  as people in your town find out that we were a paying customer, the theater would make money, we were going to pay union wages to union workers, the dates were wide open on your calendar and that I have have spoken to crowds before in Ohio with upwards to 10,000 people in attendance. And your fear that my presence in your town would cause disruption -- well, I guess you're admitting that some local Republicans and Trump supporters might cause some destruction of property or put us in jeopardy. Speaks well of the citizens whom you're trying to please by barring me from renting the theater. 

Just say what you told us, be proud of it, and sooner or later people in your town will have had enough of you and things will get better. That's one of the main lessons of history. Frankly, it would have been nice if you had just told us to bug off when we were there, after we flew all the way from New York to see you. Instead, your staff was THRILLED to have us book the show there and so were we. Half a week went by and, after your ""board"" found out it was me coming to town, that's when the hammer came down. No one on the board was brave enough to call us themselves -- that was left to an employee. More than one person in your town has told us they believe this is an ""act of censorship."" Btw, I feel bad for the young people who have to grow up in closed-minded places  like this. Please trust that we'll be visiting your fine town when we arrive in Ohio, invited or not.",Newark's Midland Theatre turns away filmmaker Michael Moore,link,http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/26/Michael_Moore_turned_away_at_Newarkxs_Midland_Theatre.html#Wow,2016-09-28 00:38:45,2959,312,370,2200,49,251,16,67,376
24674986856_10153798522171857,"I've been planning an ""October Surprise"" for the election, for all of you, and I have succeeded in keeping it a secret until now.

I've written a one-man show about this crazy Presidential race and was planning to perform it live -- and film it -- on Oct 7th in Newark, Ohio, the seat of Licking County, right in the heart of Trump Country. My producers flew there on September 15th and negotiated the rental and use of the historic Midland Theater in downtown Newark. Their staff greeted us with open arms and happily agreed to let me book my show. My team then returned to NYC and we set about preparing the shoot and putting the final touches on the production. 

Well, this past week, my big plans got dealt a death blow by the Republicans of Licking County, Ohio. We got a call from the theater management telling us, ""We're sorry but the community board that oversees the theater has voted to not allow Michael Moore to perform his show here. We are declining the rental."" When asked why, it was explained to us that, ""Michael Moore's appearance here could reflect negatively upon the Midland  Theatre. He is too controversial and the risk is too great. The board is afraid that renting the theater to him
may cause the theater to lose long-standing patrons. Our board here is fairly conservative and it was felt that Mr. Moore would try to sway people's minds to vote his way.""

Well, they got that right. They aren't stupid. This show, and my plan to release a video of it it nationwide so it can be seen by millions in the weeks before the election, should definitely ""sway"" some people into voting!So, good for them at the Midland Theatre in Licking County, Ohio, that they get the subversive intent behind this one-man show. I'll take it as a compliment.

That said, this decision left my production without a place to stage our show in the swing state of Ohio. Well, folks, I'm not leaving and going somewhere else. Sorry, Florida -- you were our second choice, and yes, we know how welcomed we'd be in your insane excuse for a state, but we're staying right here because, well, it's clear now that Ohio really, truly needs us.  

And lo and behold, as I was writing this, my producer has informed me that it looks like we may have found a place about an hour or so down the road from Licking County, even deeper into southern Ohio, with even more Trump supporters. A county that has 25,000 registered voters -- and only 500 of them are Democrats! Yeah, baby! TrumpLand on steroids! But I'm told they believe in free speech. Imagine that. The show is on! 

So, good people of Licking County, you can rest easy now. Or you can convince your nonprofit board (which is controlled by a bunch of local for-profit businessmen) to change their minds and let me in the door. I'll come do a second show for you. It's still a free country, right? What are you afraid of? That people with a conscience who hear some truth might begin laughing AT your candidate instead of voting for him? 

The bottom line: I'm going to perform this show in Ohio. It's 2016, for crying out loud. And personally - sorry for the whining - I'm tired of all the shit I always have to go through. But that's nothing compared to what all of us and the rest of the world are going to have to endure come November 8th if things go very, very wrong.

So... onward to Ohio the first week of October! (I'll let you know the details later.) Maybe after I film my show in a town that will have me, I'll stop by Licking County anyway, pretend I'm still in America, and perform the show in the street outside that theater.

This was the storyline: A Republican chief of staff on Capitol Hill is attracted to a Democratic aide who also wants to be a documentary filmmaker. An ex-NSA type is hired by the Republicans to spy on her and her brother, a Democratic senator. And what they dig up is the worst imaginable evidence of her definitely being a terrorist threat: She hooked up with Michael Moore at Sundance! Proof that she's devil's daughter! And when confronted, she admits that she did indeed do the deed with MM! The Republican who was smitten with her is now so messed up by this, he starts to imagine their liaison in all its NC-17 glory. We go inside his head where what's playing is a shot by shot re-enactment of the naval officer getting it on with Nicole Kidman in Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" -- except it's me and the wonderful actress who plays the Congressional aide, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. He can't get this thought out of his head, telling her that, naturally, this would be EVERY conservative's worst nightmare. ""I mean, HE MADE FAHRENHEIT 9/11!"" he exclaims in horror, as if that's the most damning thing to say about me. Hahaha. He tries to make up with her later by buying her a copy of my movie, ""Where To Invade Next"", but it doesn't work. She figures, if he would go that nutso over her having sex with Michael Moore, then she doesn't really want to have anything to do with him. 

It was an honor to be asked to be on this show (executive produced by Ridley Scott) and we had a lot of fun making it. I was pretty scared at first as this was way outside my comfort zone, but Mary Elizabeth and the director, Ron Underwood (he made the film ""City Slickers"" with Billy Crystal) were very kind to me -- and two hours and 27 takes later I was released from the bed. I would say something here about how difficult this kind of work is, but no one is going to believe me, so I'll just leave it with what a Teamster said to me on the set after we were done: ""Thank you for what you've done for all of us!""

24674986856_10153717920336857,"The comments to my Ryan Lochte post are an amazing insight into the American psyche. The anger, the outrage toward him is overwhelming. The fact that he was a crime victim matters not to most (all sides agree now - and the videotape proves - the guard pulled a gun on him to extort money AFTER he already paid the gas station for the minor damage he did). Thanks to his inebriated exaggeration of what actually happened (drunken idiots are awful witnesses in court), he has been crucified. He has acknowledged this, he has apologized for it. But this is not enough for those who've never made a mistake, never told a lie. There's something else that they want. What is it? Why do they now mention his name in the same breath as O.J. Simpson, Michael Vick, and a host of athletes who've been arrested for physical and sexual assault? He peed behind a gas station and might have damaged a urinal ad. And then he tried to make up a story about it. For that he must be destroyed.

Why this reaction? I would love it if there's a psychologist out there who would read these public comments on my Lochte post and then write something about what it all says about this American habit of celebrity worship up to the point when we must then bring the celebrity down.

I'm not trained in psychology, but here's my two cents about this rage and its origins:

As babies, most of us are made to feel very special - because we are! Throughout childhood there is an accepted narcissism within us - we remain special little people, and it feels gooood. The world revolves around us. Every need is taken care of.

And then we become adults.

And in no time we are no longer so very special. We have to take care of ourselves. There is no trophy for everyone on the team. Life is hard, debts grow, not everyone who meets you wants to go out with you.

But there is much good in adult life. And one way we all get to feel a little better is the pleasure we receive from living vicariously through the lives others who have ""made it."" Heroes, celebrities, rock stars -- they all get to have an acceptable form of narcissism that we identify with (the child in us still looking to be seen as special) and we like it. Here is Peyton Manning -- he's not a child, but he's special! Oprah - not a child, but very special. Kim Kardashian - special! Yet deep down there is a sadness in us, a loss of what we had as children when we were special -- and these people remind us of that. The world seems to wait on them, adore them, revolve around them. The list of the famous, all treated as if they were special, is varied and long. Most of us aren't on it. That's just the way it is. And we accept that.

But should one of these famous people slip, fall or just rub us the wrong way, watch out. That lost child in us explodes. And in an instant a narcissistic swimmer can go from being revered to being despised. No understanding, no forgiveness. Over and out. (Btw, nothing was ever handed to him. He became the second greatest swimmer ever through dedication and hard work. For decades. Our inner self also knows we would never have that kind of discipline or focus to pull off what he did for 20+ years. The bastard!)

Ok, I'll put away my shrink's hat. Just know that I could give a rat's ass about ""Ryan Lochte"" the former celebrity. It's you I'm worried about. Compassion. It only means something when you can give it to those who don't seem to deserve it. Sure, JC cared about the blind and the infirm. But it was when he stood in front of the prostitute the mob was about to stone to death that he showed what real compassion was about. When it meant he might have to sacrifice a bit of his holier-than-thou attitude for someone who wasn't living by the moral code he and Dad had set up. 

That's all. I'll shut up now. I've given you Freud and the Bible and that's plenty for one morning.",,status,,2016-08-25 09:15:37,6325,1217,964,5611,568,78,22,17,29
24674986856_10153712939216857,"Ode to Ryan Lochte
by 
Michael Moore

Oh how righteous we all are! We who have never peed outdoors! No! Not one of us have ever done that! We who have never been inebriated! No! None of us have ever been inebriated! We who have never won 12 Olympic medals! No! We haven't -- and that's why we must take him down, we who have never envied the talented or wished our lives weren't so mediocre or boring or unfulfilling! No! Not us! It's him! Him! He's the criminal! He lied to the Today Show's Billy Bush! Yes, a Bush, of that same Bush family! It is a federal crime to lie to a Bush (they who tell no lies!)! Federal Code Title 18 Section XXXV Statute 6352: ""Talking while drunk to Billy Bush is a felony punishable by a fine, ridicule from Matt Lauer and a loss of your Speedo endorsement.""

Ryan Lochte -- how dare you say you had a gun pulled on you by a guy with a badge who demanded money from you when in fact you had a guy with a badge pull a gun on you and demand money from you! Matt Lauer said that wasn't a robbery - it was a ""negotiation!"" Oh ye gods of justice, I pray a man in a uniform pulls a gun on Matt Lauer tonight after the Billy Joel concert at the Garden and demand money from him because he pounded his mighty fist against one of those disgusting ad posters we men are forced to look at while relieving ourselves! Pull the gun on him and ""negotiate"" with him, but don't hurt him, dear rent-a-cop!

Wait! What's this, pray tell? Now we hear the urinal ad poster might have been already defaced BEFORE the swimmers ever appeared at said gas station?! And exactly what kind of gas station needs three armed guards? Where exactly are we? In a city that had called in 80,000 extra police for the week, the three armed security guards couldn't call for a cop a half-a-block away? No! Why should they! They were just ""negotiating"" with the swimmers! And they could tell by looking into the eyes of one them -- a blackout drunk if ever there ever was one -- that he was just hours away from… lying to Billy Bush! Yes, keep that gun pointed at him! He will tell Billy Bush the gun was pressed against his ""forehead,"" but if you just point it toward his head, that will make him a LIAR and all the people who could never dream of having 12 Olympic medals will raise their voice in judgment and condemn him! Shame! Shame on you, Ryan Lochte! 

What? There's more? After nine seconds of footage of the man pointing the gun toward Ryan Lochte, the next three minutes on the security camera tape have been... ERASED?! Who would do that? Surely not the kangaroo court that wouldn't return the passport of the swimmer until he gave the ""judge"" $11,000 to the judge's favorite ""charity"" -- and then sign a statement they prepared for him blaming said criminal Ryan Lochte?! You don't mean the same ""justice"" system that kidnapped two other swimmers off the plane -- the two who DIDN'T pee outdoors in the bushes behind the building, who didn't damage the urinal ad, who didn't do ANYTHING -- but they were hauled off the plane and held in jail until they, too, signed some document blaming this Lochte loser?! Only then could they leave! Justice! I love how other countries try to emulate us, our beautiful American System of Justice. They got one thing right in Rio – if the perp is white, make the sentence light. But they forgot the importance of subtly and appearances. Some day maybe they will be like us and NOT let the innocent go scot-free after 24 hours, but instead jail them for years in a private prison to make profits for the rich. These Brazilians only collected $11K from the swimmers! Amateurs!

Nonetheless, the good news is that this incident will teach a lesson to arrogant jocks everywhere! We've hated these jocks since high school. Loud, noisy, drunken, stupid, handsome, strong, successful sports idiots! Finally, four of them got their comeuppance! Out all night drinking, drunk -- but...wait... they didn't get behind the wheel of a car -- they took a taxi. They didn't steal donuts or Pringles at the gas station. They didn't pee in front of everybody -- they went out back. They didn't stiff the taxi driver -- no, they gave him a tip! Three of them conked out back in their rooms -- but one of them had the sad misfortune of running into Billy Bush while in that strange transition phase between wasted and hungover. And if you've ever been in that moment, well, you know exactly how it is -- you are sooooo articulate! Your mind is as sharp as a javelin, your tongue as clear as a shot into the German net! Yes, yes -- Billy could tell you were not ""all there,"" Ryan. That you were in an altered state. Gee, what is the name for that, when one takes advantage of someone else when they are inebriated? If Speedo had put a pen in Ryan's hand at that instant to renew their deal while he was drunk, the contract wouldn't have held up in court. Every time the media runs the clip of Ryan Lochte telling his drunken/hungover exaggerated version of what was basically the truth, the media is continuing to abuse someone who was not in control of his faculties. Does this bother anyone? Is this the culture we live in? Well, if you're a woman, you already know the answer.

Yes, there are Ugly Americans who visit the Third World and do awful, racist, classist, stupid, cruel things -- and I'm not just talking about when Billy Bush's cousin invaded Iraq. You can also throw in every American tourist and visitor whose boorish behavior gives us all a bad name, like when the CIA and United Fruit overthrew the democratically-elected president of Guatemala (1954).

But that isn't Ryan Lochte! No, he's much worse. He got drunk and couldn't remember every detail about the man who actually pulled a gun on him for money. He forgot to totally trash the gas station and beat up the homeless guy sitting outside. He didn't abuse women. He was not a football player! No! These guys were swimmers! They shave their legs -- and their chests! And, in a final act of humiliation, Ryan Lochte today lost the endorsement of the parent company of ""Gentle Hair Remover."" That'll teach him! That'll teach him, how his fellow Americans turned on him so quickly before they knew all the facts. That was the thanks he got from a grateful nation after giving up his entire adult life to swim for his country and ""bring home the gold."" There's so much hate going around these days, we even throw it at a guy who's the second most decorated swimmer ever, a guy who proudly waved our flag and held his hand over his heart during our national anthem. Yeah, fuck you Ryan Lochte! And God Bless these United States of America, where everyone gets to throw the first stone.",,status,,2016-08-23 11:52:50,5937,1285,1638,5000,470,104,262,36,65

24674986856_10153682138986857,"Here is my open letter to Ivanka Trump...

Dear Ivanka:

I'm writing to you because your dad is not well. 

Every day he continues his spiral downward – and after his call for gun owners to commit acts of violence against Mrs. Clinton, it is clear he needs help, serious help. His comments and behavior have become more and more bizarre and detached from reality. He is in need of an intervention. And I believe only you can conduct it.

He trusts you. He believes in you. Although I don't know you personally, you seem to be a very smart and together woman. I think he will listen to you. He must because he is now not simply a danger to himself, he has put the next president of the United States in harms way. He has encouraged and given permission to the unhinged and the deranged to essentially assassinate Hillary Clinton. Her life is now in worse danger than it already was – and should anything happen, that will not only be on his head but also on those closest to him if they stand by and do nothing. I say this with the utmost kindness, care and concern for you, and I know you will do the right thing. Bring him in, off the road, away from the crowds. Now. Tonight.

And when you do, here is what a good friend of mine, a former counselor and social worker, Jeff Gibbs, suggests that you say to him:

Dad, we need to have a chat.  Are you feeling okay? Do you have a minute? Please sit down. Because this isn't going to be easy. No, I am not pregnant. No, what is going on is... is… I am really, really worried about my father. About you.

Dad, I owe everything to you. You've built an empire, a brand and a business for the ages. You have taken care of me, inspired me and, through your example, have made me who I am: a self-confident, honest-to-a-flaw, woman.

But Dad, I am deeply worried. You haven't been yourself lately. The father I know is not a hater, not someone who encourages violence. Dad, you used to be A LIBERAL. You raised me as a liberal! The Clintons were your friends -- Chelsea is one of my best friends! And now you're joking that Hillary should be assassinated? Really?

Dad, I hate to say this, but you're making me scared, you're making my friends scared, and you're scaring the whole country.

Dad… Dad, sit down! They'll wait. I am not finished. Don't get angry. Try to listen.

Yes, I know they love it, the crowd goes wild. But not for YOU. They don't love YOU. They love the show that you put on. But people that hunger for red meat will turn on you in a minute. No, they don't love you. I love you. I will always love you. And I see you hurting yourself -- and you're hurting ME, Dad.

Don't get upset! You're still the handsomest billionaire I know. I will always love you. Melania will always love you. Vladimir will always love you... OK, maybe that wasn't funny. But you get my point. This running for President thing is destroying the dad I have known and loved. And honestly, you and I both know you didn't really want this job to begin with! You just wanted to make a point. Ok, well, POINT MADE! You did it! Now, let's stop and get some help.

I am asking you, right now, to give it up. To leave the race. Let that nice man from Indiana run things. Your place in history is secure. You need to withdraw. Move on, for your sake, for the country's sake, for my sake.

The man who raised me was the man who, for no charge, built a huge ice rink in Central Park for all the people to use! You struck deals with some of the biggest assholes on the planet in finance and politics and yet remained friends, mostly. You built a family that loves you. I want that dad back! And I worry that, if you don't stop now, neither you nor the country will ever recover.

There, there, Dad, it's okay, let it out. Let it out because I know beneath that gruff, tough, handsome exterior is a little boy who just never got enough love. And that little boy needs some time to find himself again.

Let's you and I walk out there now right now. The cameras are all set up and waiting. You can make up whatever excuse you want. You can blame whomever you want. You're good at that! I just know this can't go on, and you know it, too.

Take my hand, let's end this. And by tomorrow you and I will be sipping Martinis on our yacht in the Hamptons with Chelsea and the friends we still have left. I love you, Dad. Let's do this. That's right, take my hand, here we go…

Ivanka, I have faith in you that you can do this. I know I've called your dad ""crazy"" before, but I was speaking politically, not clinically. This has gone beyond ""crazy"". The entire nation -- in fact, the entire world -- needs you to step forward and do the courageous thing history will praise you for: the loving act of a brilliant daughter who also loved her beleaguered country enough to say her father wasn't well and needed help.

Over the past few days, a number of polls have come out showing Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump nationally by double digits, including in blue collar states like Michigan (10%) and Pennsylvania (11%). If you are a Clinton supporter and have felt a sense of relief when you saw these numbers, your shoulders suddenly relaxing and an audible ""phew"" coming from your mouth, if you got excited that your belief system was now reassured that there was no chance your fellow Americans will vote for a narcissistic misogynist, then you just became part of the problem — and why Donald J. Trump could actually win on November 8th.

Please do not think for a second this election is over or in the bag. There are three long months to go. If you think that all we have to do is just let Trump keep shooting himself in the head – that ""Trump will beat Trump"" and the rest of us just have to sit back and watch with glee – well, you are playing with fire. And you're looking for a way to get out of doing any work. Clearly you've forgotten this election is not about whether there are more people ""for"" Hillary or Trump. Of course there are more people for Hillary! She will lead in the opinion polls from now until Election Day.

AND IT DOESN'T MATTER.

Because this is not a popularity contest decided by polls (or in this year's edition, a contest over who you dislike the least). As I've said, if people could vote from their sofa via their Xbox or remote control, Hillary would win in a landslide. But this election is only about who SHOWS UP to the VOTING BOOTH on November 8th (or to early voting or by absentee ballot). The election this year is not being held as usual on the first Tuesday of November; it's happening in the second week of the month, so if you live in the top half of the country, that means a greater chance for snow or icy rain — and that means a lower turnout. A lower turnout helps Trump.

This election is ONLY about who gets who out to vote, who's got the most rabid supporters, the kind of candidate who inspires people to get out of bed at 5am on Election Day because a Wall needs to built! Muslims are killing us! Women are taking over! USA! USA! Make My Penis Great Again! Hillary is the Devil! America First! Fetus First! First in Line at the Polls!

So instead of feeling better this week because of the new polls (BTW, only one of these polls is of ""likely voters"" – the Reuters Poll – and in that one, Hillary leads by only 4 points), or regaling over Trump's insanity (so insane, he raised $82 million last month in mostly $10-$20 contributions, stunning the Clinton campaign, because Bernie never had a grassroots month anywhere near that), I would like to suggest a different response. I'd like to ask those who love Hillary to hold off on the victory party 'til the wee hours of November 9th. Please, can we all agree that now is NOT the time to do this: http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/08/25/434585015/not-over-til-its-over-runners-early-celebration-costs-her-the-bronze

Let's stop the early celebrating and the gloating over Trump's Bad Week. No premature end zone dances. If you are serious about this election, and if you are smart enough to still take Donald Trump seriously, then here's 5 things to do – four for you, and one for Hillary:

1) You Are Responsible for Getting 50 People to the Polls November 8th. Start making your list now. Create this list on your smart phone of the people you will personally make sure show up to the polls on November 8th. Enter their email addresses and cell phone numbers. Call it your ""November 8th Project."" Add a name to it every single day between now and November 8th until you have 50 people – 50 names in 90 days. Focus on nonvoters. Then, on November 7th and 8th, call, text and/or email every one of them and remind them to vote. Offer them a ride. Offer them lunch. Offer to watch the kids. Offer to mow their lawn. Plan a get-together or a party for everyone after going to vote. You must remind even those people who you think don't need reminding. This election isn't about you voting — it's about you getting 50 others to vote.

2) From Today Until November 8th, You Are in the French Resistance. Imagine what it was like to be in the French underground while the Germans invaded France. The only possible way to win was an unrelenting, round-the-clock commitment to defeat the Nazis. There was no time for one of those 3-hour French dinners. They did not take vacations. They did not sleep in. They did not have time for ""playdates."" The Germans were coming! The Germans were there! Well, friends, our fascist (Drumpf!) is coming! That's the mind-set you need to be in. For the next three months, the kids have to get themselves to soccer! Work on your marriage in December! There's no time for hot yoga! No one in the French Resistance ever said ""I can't blow up that Nazi train today 'cause I feel like I might be coming down with a cold!""

3) You Must Be Supportive of the Depressed Voter. So many people have given up on our system and that's because the system has given up on them. They know it's all bullshit: politics, politicians, elections. The middle class in tatters, the American Dream a nightmare for the 47 million living in poverty. Get this straight: HALF of America is planning NOT to vote November 8th. Hillary's approval rating is at 36%. CNN said it last night: No one running for office with an approval rating of 36% has ever been elected president (Trump's is at 30%). Even in these newer polls, 60% still say that Hillary is ""untrustworthy to be president."" Disillusioned young people stop me every day to tell me they're not voting (or they're voting 3rd Party). This is a problem, folks. Stop ignoring it. You need to listen to them. Chastising them, shaming them, will not work. Acknowledging to them that they have a point, that Hillary Clinton is maybe not the best candidate, and then promising them that you will join them on November 9th in a political revolution that will demand Clinton enact her platform, that might go a long way to getting them to vote. They don't have to change their opinion about Hillary. They just have to reluctantly vote for her and be allowed to feel very bad about doing it – and very good that we will fight on their side after the election.

4) Hillary Must Slyly Stick Trump with a Comedy Shiv During the Debates. Bill Maher and I will help Hillary with this (Hill, call us!). I'm sure Amy Schumer and Chris Rock would chip in, too. Clinton actually has a good sense of humor, but keeps it mostly hidden (here she is back in the '90s, sparring with a Republican leader of Congress: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XsSydPOgCc). Trump has very thin skin. If she can slide the perfect line of satirical ridicule just under that thin skin of his, he will implode. On live TV. And that, my friends, will be the moment it's over for him. A complete mental meltdown on a stage without his cheering man-fans in the room. BOOM!

5)I Hereby Appoint You Precinct Captain in Your Neighborhood, in Your School, and at Your Place of Work. Yes, you. Tell them Michael Moore personally named you. Not because I have any authority to do so. Just because I said so. And you said so. Please, friends, do not depend entirely on the ""Democratic Party"" to pull this off in November. It is often, depending on where you live, an apparatus of numskulls, hacks and former high school student council rejects. Quick, name the local chair of the Dems in your county. They are not of the people. If we depend just on them, we lose. We usually do. Obama had a brilliant campaign team, was a beloved candidate, and that's why he won. Hillary's campaign lost 22 states to a 74-year old socialist who had neither a comb nor 50 bucks in his pocket — and was unknown to everyone except me and some hippies in Vermont! Hahahaha! Here's a tweet this week from one of Hillary's ""top advisers"", the chair of the ""Campaign for American Progress"", just to give you a clue as to the brain trust surrounding her:

""@neeratanden: It's weird to me that @MMFlint seems to be jonesing for a Trump victory. Am I misreading his statements or do other people see that?"" https://twitter.com/neeratanden/status/761075519450341376

So we can't just depend on them alone to stop Trump. That's why I've decided to appoint myself, as of this moment, chair of the ""Shadow Campaign to Defeat Donald J. Trump"" (or, in short, ""The Resistance"") — and I'm appointing each and every one of you as my Precinct Captains in the areas where you live, work and go to college. From this moment forward you will organize the block you live on, or the town or neighborhood you live in, or your dorm, your office, or your place of worship. If asked, just identify yourself as the ""Local Head of the Defeat Trump Coalition."" If others want to be the ""Head"" or say they are the ""Head,"" just share the title with them. Then appoint more Precinct Captains. Don't hold meetings. Do actions. Use humor. Conduct flash mobs. Be a disruptor. Think creatively and subversively. Have fun. Defeat Trump.

Because, you see, we have no choice. We're in the Trump Resistance.

Yours in revolution and future playdates,
Michael Moore

P.S. Still feeling giddy about all the bad news surrounding Trump this week? Here's another bucket of cold water: Trump can actually lose Florida, Virginia, Colorado and New Mexico — and STILL WIN! All he has to do is carry the rust belt ""Brexit States"" of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Hillary lost three of these four in the primaries. Nothing can be taken for granted. Once more: This is all about who shows up November 8th — not who's ahead in the popularity polls right now. On the morning of the Michigan Primary, Hillary was ahead of Bernie in a WJBK/TV2-Detroit poll by 22 points. Twelve hours later, she lost. Leave your bubble now! You are a Precinct Captain! You have work to do!

24674986856_10153640468311857,"MY NEW LETTER: ""5 REASONS WHY TRUMP WILL WIN"" 

Friends:
I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I gave it to you straight last summer when I told you that Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee for president. And now I have even more awful, depressing news for you: Donald J. Trump is going to win in November. This wretched, ignorant, dangerous part-time clown and full time sociopath is going to be our next president. President Trump. Go ahead and say the words, 'cause you'll be saying them for the next four years: ""PRESIDENT TRUMP.""

Never in my life have I wanted to be proven wrong more than I do right now.

I can see what you're doing right now. You're shaking your head wildly – ""No, Mike, this won't happen!"" Unfortunately, you are living in a bubble that comes with an adjoining echo chamber where you and your friends are convinced the American people are not going to elect an idiot for president. You alternate between being appalled at him and laughing at him because of his latest crazy comment or his embarrassingly narcissistic stance on everything because everything is about him. And then you listen to Hillary and you behold our very first female president, someone the world respects, someone who is whip-smart and cares about kids, who will continue the Obama legacy because that is what the American people clearly want! Yes! Four more years of this!

You need to exit that bubble right now. You need to stop living in denial and face the truth which you know deep down is very, very real. Trying to soothe yourself with the facts – ""77% of the electorate are women, people of color, young adults under 35 and Trump cant win a majority of any of them!"" – or logic – ""people aren't going to vote for a buffoon or against their own best interests!"" – is your brain's way of trying to protect you from trauma. Like when you hear a loud noise on the street and you think, ""oh, a tire just blew out,"" or, ""wow, who's playing with firecrackers?"" because you don't want to think you just heard someone being shot with a gun. It's the same reason why all the initial news and eyewitness reports on 9/11 said ""a small plane accidentally flew into the World Trade Center."" We want to – we need to – hope for the best because, frankly, life is already a shit show and it's hard enough struggling to get by from paycheck to paycheck. We can't handle much more bad news. So our mental state goes to default when something scary is actually, truly happening. The first people plowed down by the truck in Nice spent their final moments on earth waving at the driver whom they thought had simply lost control of his truck, trying to tell him that he jumped the curb: ""Watch out!,"" they shouted. ""There are people on the sidewalk!""

Well, folks, this isn't an accident. It is happening. And if you believe Hillary Clinton is going to beat Trump with facts and smarts and logic, then you obviously missed the past year of 56 primaries and caucuses where 16 Republican candidates tried that and every kitchen sink they could throw at Trump and nothing could stop his juggernaut. As of today, as things stand now, I believe this is going to happen – and in order to deal with it, I need you first to acknowledge it, and then maybe, just maybe, we can find a way out of the mess we're in.

Don't get me wrong. I have great hope for the country I live in. Things are better. The left has won the cultural wars. Gays and lesbians can get married. A majority of Americans now take the liberal position on just about every polling question posed to them: Equal pay for women – check. Abortion should be legal – check. Stronger environmental laws – check. More gun control – check. Legalize marijuana – check. A huge shift has taken place – just ask the socialist who won 22 states this year. And there is no doubt in my mind that if people could vote from their couch at home on their X-box or PlayStation, Hillary would win in a landslide.

But that is not how it works in America. People have to leave the house and get in line to vote. And if they live in poor, Black or Hispanic neighborhoods, they not only have a longer line to wait in, everything is being done to literally stop them from casting a ballot. So in most elections it's hard to get even 50% to turn out to vote. And therein lies the problem for November – who is going to have the most motivated, most inspired voters show up to vote? You know the answer to this question. Who's the candidate with the most rabid supporters? Whose crazed fans are going to be up at 5 AM on Election Day, kicking ass all day long, all the way until the last polling place has closed, making sure every Tom, Dick and Harry (and Bob and Joe and Billy Bob and Billy Joe and Billy Bob Joe) has cast his ballot?  That's right. That's the high level of danger we're in. And don't fool yourself — no amount of compelling Hillary TV ads, or outfacting him in the debates or Libertarians siphoning votes away from Trump is going to stop his mojo.

Here are the 5 reasons Trump is going to win:

1) Midwest Math, or Welcome to Our Rust Belt Brexit.  I believe Trump is going to focus much of his attention on the four blue states in the rustbelt of the upper Great Lakes – Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Four traditionally Democratic states – but each of them have elected a Republican governor since 2010 (only Pennsylvania has now finally elected a Democrat). In the Michigan primary in March, more Michiganders came out to vote for the Republicans (1.32 million) that the Democrats (1.19 million). Trump is ahead of Hillary in the latest polls in Pennsylvania and tied with her in Ohio. Tied? How can the race be this close after everything Trump has said and done? Well maybe it's because he's said (correctly) that the Clintons' support of NAFTA helped to destroy the industrial states of the Upper Midwest. Trump is going to hammer Clinton on this and her support of TPP and other trade policies that have royally screwed the people of these four states. When Trump stood in the shadow of a Ford Motor factory during the Michigan primary, he threatened the corporation that if they did indeed go ahead with their planned closure of that factory and move it to Mexico, he would slap a 35% tariff on any Mexican-built cars shipped back to the United States. It was sweet, sweet music to the ears of the working class of Michigan, and when he tossed in his threat to Apple that he would force them to stop making their iPhones in China and build them here in America, well, hearts swooned and Trump walked away with a big victory that should have gone to the governor next-door, John Kasich.

From Green Bay to Pittsburgh, this, my friends, is the middle of England – broken, depressed, struggling, the smokestacks strewn across the countryside with the carcass of what we use to call the Middle Class. Angry, embittered working (and nonworking) people who were lied to by the trickle-down of Reagan and abandoned by Democrats who still try to talk a good line but are really just looking forward to rub one out with a lobbyist from Goldman Sachs who'll write them nice big check before leaving the room. What happened in the UK with Brexit is going to happen here. Elmer Gantry shows up looking like Boris Johnson and just says whatever shit he can make up to convince the masses that this is their chance! To stick to ALL of them, all who wrecked their American Dream! And now The Outsider, Donald Trump, has arrived to clean house! You don't have to agree with him! You don't even have to like him! He is your personal Molotov cocktail to throw right into the center of the bastards who did this to you! SEND A MESSAGE! TRUMP IS YOUR MESSENGER!

And this is where the math comes in. In 2012, Mitt Romney lost by 64 electoral votes. Add up the electoral votes cast by Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It's 64. All Trump needs to do to win is to carry, as he's expected to do, the swath of traditional red states from Idaho to Georgia (states that'll never vote for Hillary Clinton), and then he just needs these four rust belt states. He doesn't need Florida. He doesn't need Colorado or Virginia. Just Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And that will put him over the top. This is how it will happen in November.

2) The Last Stand of the Angry White Man. Our male-dominated, 240-year run of the USA is coming to an end. A woman is about to take over! How did this happen?! On our watch! There were warning signs, but we ignored them. Nixon, the gender traitor, imposing Title IX on us, the rule that said girls in school should get an equal chance at playing sports. Then they let them fly commercial jets. Before we knew it, Beyoncé stormed on the field at this year's Super Bowl (our game!) with an army of Black Women, fists raised, declaring that our domination was hereby terminated! Oh, the humanity!

That's a small peek into the mind of the Endangered White Male. There is a sense that the power has slipped out of their hands, that their way of doing things is no longer how things are done. This monster, the ""Feminazi,""the thing that as Trump says, ""bleeds through her eyes or wherever she bleeds,"" has conquered us — and now, after having had to endure eight years of a black man telling us what to do, we're supposed to just sit back and take eight years of a woman bossing us around? After that it'll be eight years of the gays in the White House! Then the transgenders! You can see where this is going. By then animals will have been granted human rights and a fuckin' hamster is going to be running the country. This has to stop!

3) The Hillary Problem. Can we speak honestly, just among ourselves? And before we do, let me state, I actually like Hillary – a lot – and I think she has been given a bad rap she doesn't deserve. But her vote for the Iraq War made me promise her that I would never vote for her again. To date, I haven't broken that promise. For the sake of preventing a proto-fascist from becoming our commander-in-chief, I'm breaking that promise. I sadly believe Clinton will find a way to get us in some kind of military action. She's a hawk, to the right of Obama. But Trump's psycho finger will be on The Button, and that is that. Done and done.

Let's face it: Our biggest problem here isn't Trump – it's Hillary. She is hugely unpopular — nearly 70% of all voters think she is untrustworthy and dishonest. She represents the old way of politics, not really believing in anything other than what can get you elected. That's why she fights against gays getting married one moment, and the next she's officiating a gay marriage. Young women are among her biggest detractors, which has to hurt considering it's the sacrifices and the battles that Hillary and other women of her generation endured so that this younger generation would never have to be told by the Barbara Bushes of the world that they should just shut up and go bake some cookies. But the kids don't like her, and not a day goes by that a millennial doesn't tell me they aren't voting for her. No Democrat, and certainly no independent, is waking up on November 8th excited to run out and vote for Hillary the way they did the day Obama became president or when Bernie was on the primary ballot. The enthusiasm just isn't there. And because this election is going to come down to just one thing — who drags the most people out of the house and gets them to the polls — Trump right now is in the catbird seat.

4) The Depressed Sanders Vote. Stop fretting about Bernie's supporters not voting for Clinton – we're voting for Clinton! The polls already show that more Sanders voters will vote for Hillary this year than the number of Hillary primary voters in '08 who then voted for Obama. This is not the problem. The fire alarm that should be going off is that while the average Bernie backer will drag him/herself to the polls that day to somewhat reluctantly vote for Hillary, it will be what's called a ""depressed vote"" – meaning the voter doesn't bring five people to vote with her. He doesn't volunteer 10 hours in the month leading up to the election. She never talks in an excited voice when asked why she's voting for Hillary. A depressed voter. Because, when you're young, you have zero tolerance for phonies and BS. Returning to the Clinton/Bush era for them is like suddenly having to pay for music, or using MySpace or carrying around one of those big-ass portable phones. They're not going to vote for Trump; some will vote third party, but many will just stay home. Hillary Clinton is going to have to do something to give them a reason to support her  — and picking a moderate, bland-o, middle of the road old white guy as her running mate is not the kind of edgy move that tells millenials that their vote is important to Hillary. Having two women on the ticket – that was an exciting idea. But then Hillary got scared and has decided to play it safe. This is just one example of how she is killing the youth vote.

5) The Jesse Ventura Effect. Finally, do not discount the electorate's ability to be mischievous or underestimate how any millions fancy themselves as closet anarchists once they draw the curtain and are all alone in the voting booth. It's one of the few places left in society where there are no security cameras, no listening devices, no spouses, no kids, no boss, no cops, there's not even a friggin' time limit. You can take as long as you need in there and no one can make you do anything. You can push the button and vote a straight party line, or you can write in Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. There are no rules. And because of that, and the anger that so many have toward a broken political system, millions are going to vote for Trump not because they agree with him, not because they like his bigotry or ego, but just because they can. Just because it will upset the apple cart and make mommy and daddy mad. And in the same way like when you're standing on the edge of Niagara Falls and your mind wonders for a moment what would that feel like to go over that thing, a lot of people are going to love being in the position of puppetmaster and plunking down for Trump just to see what that might look like. Remember back in the '90s when the people of Minnesota elected a professional wrestler as their governor? They didn't do this because they're stupid or thought that Jesse Ventura was some sort of statesman or political intellectual. They did so just because they could. Minnesota is one of the smartest states in the country. It is also filled with people who have a dark sense of humor — and voting for Ventura was their version of a good practical joke on a sick political system. This is going to happen again with Trump.

Coming back to the hotel after appearing on Bill Maher's Republican Convention special this week on HBO, a man stopped me. ""Mike,"" he said, ""we have to vote for Trump. We HAVE to shake things up."" That was it. That was enough for him. To ""shake things up."" President Trump would indeed do just that, and a good chunk of the electorate would like to sit in the bleachers and watch that reality show.

(Next week I will post my thoughts on Trump's Achilles Heel and how I think he can be beat.)

Cops on scene during first minute jumped to conclusion it was protestors firing on them and so they pulled their guns on the demonstrators. Everyone threw their hands up screaming ""don't shoot"" to the cops. That's when a number of the police were shot because their initial focus was not on the direction where bullets were coming from (above). It was the protestors, according to this eyewitness, who yelled to the cops that the bullets were coming from up above in the parking garage.

""Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on Brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights? No I'm not going 10,000 miles from home to help murder and burn another poor nation simply to continue the domination of white slave masters of the darker people the world over. This is the day when such evils must come to an end. I have been warned that to take such a stand would cost me millions of dollars. But I have said it once and I will say it again. The real enemy of my people is here. I will not disgrace my religion, my people or myself by becoming a tool to enslave those who are fighting for their own justice, freedom and equality…. If I thought the war was going to bring freedom and equality to 22 million of my people they wouldn't have to draft me, I'd join tomorrow. I have nothing to lose by standing up for my beliefs. So I'll go to jail, so what? We've been in jail for 400 years.""

After taking this stand and refusing to be drafted into the US Army, Ali was arrested, convicted as a felon, stripped of his boxing title, prohibited from boxing anywhere and given a prison sentence for refusing to go to Vietnam. He appealed it all the way to the Supreme Court where he won. 

This is the kind of selfless, courageous action we are sorely missing today. Who amongst us would risk EVERYTHING for what we believe in, for doing what we know in our hearts is right?

24674986856_10153527139826857,"From the looks of it, the comments to my last Facebook post, in which I criticized our beloved President Obama for betraying Flint by publicly drinking its water (and thus falsely implying to the world that it was clean and safe to drink), has caused a bit of a row. I was also upset that Michigan's governor still hasn't been arrested for poisoning Flint's children, and the president still hasn't sent in the Army Corps of Engineers to replace Flint's damaged pipes. 

From the reaction to my words, I guess it's clear that us Obama supporters fall essentially into two camps:

•Camp #1: Those who support the president unconditionally and without question because not only has he done so much good for this country, he needs every single one of us to stand and protect him from the Congressional obstructionists who have made it their mission to stop him from doing any further good. They're right about that -- AND the fact that this Obama Hatred is most definitely a race-based hatred. But then they take this position: Anyone who says a single negative word about President Obama - including those who do love him - are only helping the enemy. 

• Camp #2: Those like me who voted for him twice -- the first time in '08 with great enthusiasm and emotion  (truthfully, I teared up as I voted in the booth that day for Barrack Hussein Obama). Camp #2 is full of people who give him great credit for what he's accomplished and consider him to be possibly the best president in our lifetime -- BUT we are also disappointed that he squandered his opportunity to accomplish so much more in his first term when, during those first two years, the Republicans did not control EITHER house of Congress. We are disappointed that he's deported more people than all past American presidents combined, imprisoned more whistleblowers than all past American presidents combined, and has our military conducting acts of war in SEVEN separate countries -- more continuous years of war than any president in our history (more than FDR, Lincoln, Johnson or Nixon, according to last week's NY Times). This second camp of Obama supporters believes it is our duty to encourage him to live up to his promises, offer criticism when he's wrong and aggressively support him when he needs our help to stay strong and do the right thing. But we're different in this one way: We have never blindly supported any politician, no matter how good she/he is, and we see our job as citizens is to keep them all honest (and protect the good ones when needed from the bigots and the haters).

I'm always amazed that Camp #1 goes ballistic when Camp #2 speaks up and offers any criticism of Barack Onama. Hillary Clinton has successfully exploited this, taking direct aim at the Black community with her early denouncing of Bernie Sanders as anti-Obama. Even though Sanders has probably voted for Obama's programs 95% of the time, the fact that he has dared to question the White House's lackluster policing of Wall Street or why GITMO is still open has led him to being painted as some guy who doesn't have the president's back. It was Sanders who risked bodily injury committing acts of civil disobedience as part of the Civil Rights movement in the '60s while Hillary was ""evolving,"" eventually seeing the error of her ways as a member of the Young College Republicans, and evolving further in 2011 when she admitted the error of her years-long fight against gay marriage, and again in 2015 seeing the error of her husband's ""drug laws"" (which she had once enthusiastically supported) that kicked off 20+ years of ruthless mass incarceration of African Americans). But as long she keeps repeating her mantra that she'll continue doing whatever Obama is doing, implicitly promising ""a 3rd Obama term,"" well, that definitely seems cool with Camp #1.

As to my Facebook post on Flint, I am disheartened to see so many progressives willing to the let the president off the hook: ""He didn't cause the problem!"" ""He's doing the best he can!"" ""He's got more important issues to deal with than Flint!""

That last one is the one that stings. Of course he had nothing to do with poisoning the people of Flint. That was done by a Republican governor who only did what he promised the voters in Michigan he'd do: give the rich a billion-dollar tax break and cut services to poor cities like Flint. This crime is on him -- and on the majority of my fellow Michiganders who voted for him.

But that's why we have someone like Barack Obama in the White House, to protect us from those who would harm the voiceless and the defenseless -- NOT land in Flint and shake the governor's hand and tell the people all is well, ""just make sure you get the right water filter."" Wow. Then he jetted off -- and few have thought about Flint since. Admit it. Admit it to me. It's OK. There's lots of things going on in your neck of the woods that I'm not thinking about today - it's a big country, and there's so much shit that needs stirring and we're all just doing the best we can do. 

But the people of Flint have been poisoned -- NOT by a delapidated infrastructure, NOT by bad environmental policy -- but by a decision made by the governor to cut corners and then pass the savings on to the rich -- all the while knowing full well that the poor and Black of Flint had no way to fight back. That's not cynicism on the part of the governor -- that's just cold, calculated racism, a hate crime in any other advanced country.

That night, after Obama left town, I was deluged with calls and texts and emails from people in Flint -- distraught, angry, abandoned, and resigned to their lives being ruined, their children with permanent, irreversible brain damage, their city, our city, destroyed. No one will move here, no business will bring jobs here, everyone knows what the true appraised value is of their homes: $0 (which the state won't cop to because, if they did, how could they ever collect the property taxes on $0?). 

I love President Obama, and if his daughters happen to run across this post of mine on Facebook, I hope they show it to their Dad. I hope he knows that Camp #1, with their unconditional, unquestioning support of him might feel good, but it's those of us in Camp #2 who are going to make sure he actually lives up to the promise of who he is and why he wanted the job in the first place. We are the ones who want his legacy to be that, when everyone else gave up on Flint, Michigan, and everyone else allowed the rich to plunder away, he was the one had the courage to turn his back on his Wall Street supporters and say ""ENOUGH"" and stop the madness in Flint. THAT is the President Obama we believe is still there, the President Obama who will be remembered for saving thousands of children in a decimated town that was once the best place in the world to live.",,status,,2016-05-31 14:18:08,8875,1279,1170,7903,759,18,5,49,141

I've been waiting for this day for seven long months -- the day when you and I get to bypass the company that owns the theatrical rights to the film and bring my new movie DIRECTLY to you. Put it in YOUR hands to own, watch it when you want, show it to whomever you want. No more middle man! No more trying to find out where the hell it's playing! No more $9 popcorn! 

Just you and me and my new movie, the aforementioned, much-acclaimed, and Oscar-shortlisted WHERE TO INVADE NEXT. 

Beginning today, right here, right now, you can download and own my movie thru iTunes http://apple.co/1N3pzw1 or Amazon http://gwi.io/5sx3t4

And in just 12 days, beginning on May 10th, you can buy it on DVD/Blu-ray, or rent it to stream (real cheap!) on iTunes or Amazon, or watch it on your cable or satellite system's OnDemand channel. Yes, it will now be THAT easy to see what many have called not only the best documentary of the year, but one of the best MOVIES of the year. Time to find out if they're right!

WHERE TO INVADE NEXT is, as one critic pointed out, my ""most dangerous and subversive film."" It's dangerous because it shows the American public exactly how we can achieve, quite easily, a very decent society. One where we all take care of each other, where there's true, free and universal health care, a stunningly amazing educational system, a place where no one needs a second job, everyone gets at least a month's paid vacation, all families have paid maternity and sick leave, where the war on drugs is over and the prisons are now half-empty because people got help or were just left to live their lives in peace. There is a whole world out there where I take you from country to country to country and expose all the lies we've been told: 

*The French don't pay more ""taxes"" than us -- they actually pay LESS than we do;

*College doesn't have to bankrupt you -- in fact, even the poorest of countries can afford to let everyone go to university for free;

*Imagine countries where their justice system is not set up to mass incarcerate one particular racial group;

*Instead of spending their money on war and invading countries, what would you say if I showed you how ALL the other democracies spend their money on their people?

*And the number one thing I saw, over and over: Where women have true political and economic power, EVERYONE'S life gets better. Imagine that.  

Those places actually exist -- and it's called... the rest of the civilized world! We've been lied to and misled for too long. And I don't just talk about this -- I SHOW YOU the schools in Finland, the prisons in Norway, the bright and humane factories in Germany (where everyone makes a middle class wage), the public school lunchroom in France where students are fed a four-course meal, and you get to meet the college students in Slovenia who have absolutely no frighin' idea what a ""student loan"" is.

This is what makes WHERE TO INVADE NEXT so subversive, because if enough of you see this movie, that's it. Once millions have this information -- and inspiration -- the game is over. For Wall Street. For the bought-off politicians. For the boss or the dean or the candidate who keeps telling you ""it just can't be done!"" That's collectively the biggest con ever, and I am here to blow it up once and for all with this movie. 

That's why I so desperately want you to see WHERE TO INVADE NEXT. You've probably already read on Twitter or Facebook people calling it ""my best film ever."" I have no problem with that statement. I'm convinced it's the best thing you'll see this year. 

So, click here -- iTunes: http://apple.co/1N3pzw1 or Amazon: http://gwi.io/5sx3t4 -- to download and own it right now. Watch it tonight or this weekend. It's funny, it's jaw-dropping, it's the best use of two hours I can recommend for you (short of the other obvious choices you can partake in in the privacy of your home). 

Let me know what you think! I'll be on Facebook this Sunday from 4 to 5pm ET taking your questions and discussing the film with all of you. 

Own this movie! You will not be disappointed! You will be uplifted, entertained, astounded, blown away, mad, thrilled and re-energized. This I promise you, and I don't think I've ever let you down. 

Thanks for all your support through the years. Thanks for your well-wishes over the past months. I'm very happy I got to make this particular movie at this particular moment in history.

P.S. To answer the most anticipated question -- ""When will it be on Netflix?"" -- um, well, it's not. That's a juicy story for a later time (in my forthcoming book, ""Hollywood & Me: The Kardashian Years""). Suffice it to say, I'd love to have it on Netflix. They're great, they wanted it. But... well, if I told you what I've had to put up with from people OTHER than Netflix, you'd probably say, quit your bellyaching, at least you didn't have to build Buicks for 40 years -- and to that I say, Amen.",Where to Invade Next on iTunes,link,http://apple.co/1N3pzw1,2016-04-29 12:39:19,1978,343,951,1741,219,13,1,1,2
24674986856_10153460597166857,"Dear President Obama --

Finally, after months of us begging you to come to Flint, you've decided to visit next Wednesday. I know this will make many people happy and grateful. But, as one who voted for you twice and was thrilled beyond belief over your election, I'm sorry to tell you your visit is too little too late. 

You say you're coming to ""listen to the people of Flint."" Sir, they've been poisoned for two damn years. You've known about it since October. There's nothing to listen to. Unless you're bringing the entire U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to dig up and replace the 75,000 lead pipes, plus the Attorney General to arrest Governor Rick Snyder, then this is just another photo-op and half-baked list of new promises we don't need. If you're coming to make one of those ""we need to rebuild America's infrastructure"" speeches, don't bother.  This is NOT an infrastructure problem - it's a hate crime and mass poisoning of Black and poor people that NEVER would happen if this were Bloomfield Hills or Grosse Pointe or any other white town. It was done in order to give a billion-dollar tax cut to the rich. Every child here now has some form of permanent brain damage. There is NOTHING you can do to reverse that for them. There is no cure. Again, they are Black, they are poor. Do you have a cure for that?  Because THAT's the only reason why this has happened. Flint's infrastructure was just fine (or what passes for fine these days in the USA). This poisoning happened because the governor said ""Cut services!"" -- and so one of the first services he cut was to seal off the clean drinking water pipeline from the Great Lakes and make the poor and the Black of Flint drink dirty water from the drainage ditch you and others call ""the Flint River."" We haven't called it that for years. I'd drink my own piss before I'd drink out of that sewer. 

We don't need any more visits from politicians, even one as beloved as you. We don't need any more promises of testing. We don't need any more token digging up of pipes made rancid by the Flint River water that flowed through them (of the 75,000 pipes that need replacing, a total of 39 - 39!! - have been dug up and removed since you met with the mayor in the White House back in January). Meanwhile the poisoning continues on daily basis, even with the Lake Huron water that has been restored because it's flowing through lead-damaged pipes with a new chemical that now burns people's skin. 

So unless you're bringing the U.S. Army with you to save 100,000 of your fellow Americans, and unless you're going to arrest the governor of Michigan who has now killed more Americans than ISIS, you might as well stay home.  The riots here, I'm certain, will begin sometime soon. That's what you or I would do if someone was poisoning OUR kids and the government refused to stop it, right?

With respect, admiration and profound disappointment,

Michael Moore

24674986856_10153438431481857,"Audiences Can Now Text AND Fuck in Select AMC Theaters

by
Michael Moore 

AMC Theaters, after receiving so much positive feedback from their idea to allow texting and cell phone use in their cinemas while people are watching a movie (http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11428186/amc-ceo-says-let-millennials-text-in-cinemas), has now decided that, beginning in the fall, they will have special ""fucking sections"" in select AMC theaters throughout the country.

""Most people in our cinemas are already on dates,"" said AMC Theaters
exec Adam Aron. ""Why should they have to wait 'til they get home or
are in the back seats of their cars to do what they were going to do anyway?""

When asked if the other members of the audience who are not fucking
but trying to enjoy the movie would be bothered by the copulating
couples beside them, Aron responded, ""Not necessarily. If the movie is
engaging, it should be able to hold their attention. If Hollywood made better movies, we wouldn't need to do things like allowing texting and
fucking in our theaters. Nothing, not even a couple fucking, is going
to distract you if the plot line of the movie is strong, the characters believable, and the dialogue snappy. Make better movies and
the audience's minds won't start to wander off into the urgent need to
text a cat video or hump the person next to them.""

Aron insisted that AMC was just trying to catch up with the times, considering how long the act of intercourse has been in use.

""People have been fucking since the beginning of time. The movies are
only a hundred years old. To insist that people shouldn't fuck
during the latest installment of ""Transformers"" is insulting to our customers and, frankly, it goes against the natural order of things.
People work hard all week, and we're charging them nearly $20 for a
mediocre flick and a small popcorn. The least they should be able to
get for that twenty bucks is a good lay. And if we can facilitate that
with chairs that turn into beds complete with electric candles and a
glass of Boone's Farm, then I say, 'See you at the movies!'""

Aron added that AMC may also consider in the future letting patrons
bring small farm animals into the theater ""as long as they don't shit
the place up.""",Phone-friendly movie theaters for millennials are coming,link,http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11428186/amc-ceo-says-let-millennials-text-in-cinemas,2016-04-15 19:59:32,847,236,181,543,16,15,215,9,49
24674986856_10153438425961857,"So, this story (the link below) is real. But I don't believe that millennials want to be on their phones while in a movie theater. AMC Theaters is considering allowing texting during the movies. Here's what one of their execs told Variety:

""'When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear 'please cut off your left arm above the elbow,' Adam Aron tells Variety. 'You can't tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That's not how they live their life.' Aron believes that AMC needs 'to reshape our product in some concrete ways so that millennials go to movie theaters with the same degree of intensity as baby boomers went to movie theaters throughout their lives.'""
 
I love AMC cinemas (not to be confused with the wonderful AMC TV network). They have treated me very well (as I'm sure you know, there are movie chains and theaters who refuse to play my movies). My movies have made money for AMC. I know they're frustrated that young adults have quit, in large numbers, going to the movie theaters. But this is due, in part, to the fact that good movies - great movies - are having a harder and harder time being made. If there were fresh voices (Women? Blacks? Working class?) making movies, maybe there might be something interesting and exciting to watch. 

Here's the true story from The Verge about texting coming to a movie theater near you (and my next FB post after this one will be a piece of satire on this subject which I've written today).

For them to schedule a movie on one of their screens where every seat at every show is free to everyone for a full week (and have the distributor pay for that) -- well, I've never heard of such a thing. Have you ever heard of that happening at your local multiplex? I've been involved in a few ""firsts"" with my movies, but never anything like this. I've never gone in to a multiplex, walked up to the box office counter or window to buy a ticket and then be told, ""Oh, no, that one's free -- just walk right in!"" So the fact my distributor made that happen for me in my hometown, a place of real suffering right now, to give people a couple hours of relief to take the whole family to see a movie for free -- it may seem like a small gesture, but to me it was a real act of kindness.

Friends —

What an amazing first week of release for my new film, a week that came complete with being attacked by Ted Cruz, Lindsay Graham and Jeb Bush! Who plans this stuff for me? Thank you, patron saint of hack politicians everywhere!

So, today kicks off the second week of ""Where To Invade Next""! Thanks, first, to all of you non-Presidential candidates who made this inaugural week so special. We were the top-grossing independent film of those that opened last weekend — and we placed at #6 in what's called the ""per screen average"" of ALL films in release. We grossed more than three films that are currently nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. This is a rare, rare thing for a documentary to do. And it's all because of you, so gracias!

What was even more heartening were the numerous and consistent reports from theater managers across the country who, practically in unison, told us the following (with a charming tone of disbelief and shock in their voice):

1. ""There are loud laughs and applause throughout the film and there is big applause and the end of every showing. This does not usually happen for most movies.""
2. ""Some of the showings have sold out. That doesn't happen for a documentary.""
3. ""We sometimes have had a hard time clearing the theater or the lobby after the show because people want to stand around and talk about it.""

Of course, this is all music to our ears! Not to mention all the tweets and Facebook posts like: ""I didn't want it to end,"" ""This is by far your best film,"" ""I drove four hours to see it and had to sit in the second row,"" ""What a beautiful love letter to women and the proof that women in power make a better world for all,"" ""I brought my Republican father and at the end he said he liked Michael Moore!"" and ""Bernie keeps talking about 'Denmark and Sweden' but you showed us this isn't some sort of Scandinavian fantasy — these ideas are actually happening everywhere but here!""

It's been truly an amazing seven days. Thank you. I also can't help but appreciate the healing power of it as I am now over that bout of pneumonia that had sidelined me. So, thanks for that, too!

Today begins our second weekend in theaters. The distributor has added a few more cities (Eugene, OR, Harrisburg, PA, Petaluma, CA, Littleton, CO, etc.,), and they will add more (they've promised 200 more). And they've kept all the ones from last week. By clicking here and typing in your zip code, you can find the nearest theater to you that's showing it. http://www.fandango.com/wheretoinvadenext_188065/movietimes Make a plan now to see it tonight or this weekend. As you know with documentaries, they get pushed out of theaters very fast by the big Hollywood movies (even when they're doing well), so don't put off seeing it. I can tell you from experience, even with my top-grossing docs, it won't be there in a few weeks and I won't be able to bring the DVD over to show it to you in person. So, call a friend or two, get a sitter, and go now!

And don't forget to tweet (@MMFlint http://twitter.com/MMFlint) or send me pix of you at the theater so I can re-post them for millions to see!

Finally, my personal thanks to Chris Rock, Patricia Arquette, Pharrell, Harry Belafonte, Gloria Steinem, Alicia Keys, Jane Fonda, and so many other artists who have said wonderful things about ""Where To Invade Next"" and have told their friends and fans to go see it. The support I've received from other filmmakers, and the creative community in general, has been overwhelming and so greatly appreciated. It's not easy making the kinds of films I make, and even harder trying to massage my way through the corporate control of media to bring these truths to you.

Some day, I'll tell you all about it. For now, just know that my favorite part of this first week has been watching, in the hours after the film's release, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and other Presidential candidates using my name in vain, attacking me and holding me up as the one example of an American who is ""the opposite of everything we (Republicans) stand for.""

Yes, I am. You get me, you really get me! For so long, I thought I was just misunderstood. But Ted and Jeb! — you know exactly what I'm up to, and you're about to find out later this year just how many millions of me and people like me there are. Please be my guest and come see not only my movie, but the future — the near future — of your/our country that we're going to fix.

All my best,
Michael Moore

P.S. The distributor apologizes to the people of Flint for not booking the film in my hometown last week and would like to make it up by opening it today in the two theaters there in Genesee County  – and making EVERY ticket to EVERY showing FREE all week long!

Friends,

HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY! I hope you are having a loving day today no matter what you are doing.

As many of you know, my new film WHERE TO INVADE NEXT opened this weekend and it is in theaters everywhere NOW. You can easily get your tickets by going here: www.fandango.com/wheretoinvadenext_188065/movietimes. As I reported yesterday, ""Where To Invade Next"" is not only on track to be my biggest limited opening (less than 300 screens) ever, we've just learned Saturday's box office jumped 30% over Friday's!

Consider this movie as my Valentine's gift to America (and the world). In the film I spend nearly two hours showing what happens when the decisions that are made — especially the political decisions — are based on love. Love of your neighbor, love of those who have less, love of ""the other"" (the people who are not like you).

In ""Where To Invade Next"" I travel the world and show what the U.S. would look like if we were a kinder people. And in those places where women hold true power, I found that things were just better for everyone.

So if you want to take your Valentine to a movie that is about another kind of love, I can guarantee you're going to walk out at the end uplifted, energized and with a real sense of hope. There's still time to make a night of it and hit the theatre!

And don't forget to tweet and post your pix from the evening! I'll share them with my nearly 5 million online followers. And I thank you with all my heart for sharing your Valentine's Day with me via my film.

Have a loving night and I hope you all enjoy WHERE TO INVADE NEXT!

Best,
Michael",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/photos/a.10150288227701857.331023.24674986856/10153291057266857/?type=3,2016-02-14 19:31:25,4926,350,332,4926,0,0,0,0,0

24674986856_10153285992551857,"High School Students of America:

Imagine a place where you don't have to do any homework, and you don't have to take those ridiculous standardized tests. Or how 'bout a place where your public school lunch is a luxurious four-course meal that you have the time to enjoy each day. Imagine a country where all college is free -- and it's impossible to find anyone who has a student loan to pay off. Can you believe there's actually a place where teenagers can easily get birth control with no parental permission, and that when it comes to getting free health services there's no issue because, even as a teen, the society respects that only you should have control over your own body. Imagine a world where no hall passes are required to go to the bathroom, where school is not an assembly line (and it doesn't start at 8 in the friggin' morning!). And what if, on top of all of this, you could vote at the age of 16 and have a real say in your future.

Well, that place exists. It exists in many countries, all over the world. In fact, in every advanced industrialized country, one or more of the above is already happening every single day. But not here in the U.S.A.

And so I've made a movie about all those places, a movie that will take you on a raucous, hilarious ride through the great life that they're having and we're not. It's called WHERE TO INVADE NEXT, and it opens this weekend, February 12th, in theaters across the country.

There's only one problem: It's rated ""R"".

Now, you might be asking yourself, ""Why did the American ratings board (the MPAA) give my film an 'R' rating?"" Maybe it has something to do with all the things I've just listed above. Some people would prefer you not know how teenagers in the rest of the world are treated. Bottom line: They're not treated like babies and inmates. They are treated like full-grown human beings with dignity and rights. Lots of rights.

But here in the USA, the MPAA has deemed my film too dangerous for you to see on your own. So I'd like to fix that. I'd like you to see my movie. And I'd like to help you sneak in to do that this weekend.

Now, I'm probably going to have a shitstorm rain down upon me for doing this. I don't care. Wrong is wrong, and it is wrong to not let you see this movie. The theaters or the movie studios or the censors may not like what I'm about to suggest, but they're just going to have to deal with it. It is insulting to you as a 15 or 16-yr to be told you can't handle the truth. What year is this — 1952?

By now, you probably know all the ways to sneak into an ""R""-rated movie — buy a ticket to another film then sneak in; go in to the PG film you bought a ticket for then go out to get popcorn and ""forget"" your ticket so you can then head in to the ""R""-rated film; etc.

Here are a few of the other ways (some of which I'm sure you've tried):

1) Buy your ticket online. That gets you past the first gatekeeper at the ticket window who wants to see your ID. http://www.fandango.com/wheretoinvadenext_188065/movietimes

2) Speaking of ID – here's a good site on how to make fake ID: (use responsibly, not for alcohol or joining the army) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.bugbyte.fakeidgenerator&hl=en

3) Have a 17 or 18-yr. old friend buy the tickets for you, or randomly ask an adult in line to do it. Tell them why you want to see this movie. It's not like standing outside the 7-11 trying to get a stranger to buy beer.

4) While standing at the box office window or in front of the ticket taker, try to mimic the way older adults look and sound so as to draw less attention to yourself. Suggestions: be hunched over, look tired, stressed out; have a glaze over your eyes, or a distant stare into a bleak future of abandoned hope. Talk about your 401K or the baby keeping you up at night or something you read in the Wall Street Journal. That should do the trick.

5) If you buy a ticket to another film that's PG-13 in order to sneak in to mine, may I suggest helping out the box office of ""Creed"", ""Brooklyn"" or ""Hail Caesar"". They're good movies, and you should come back and see them anyway.

Any of the above should work. And if you are a parent reading your teen's email and you're shocked I'm doing this, let me reassure you that my film contains little profanity, no one is having sex on camera, and the minimal violence that is shown is of police in the U.S. abusing people of color. Thank god this is not your typical PG-13 movie where hundreds get slaughtered, women are exploited and are the victims of rampant misogyny, and abhorrent values of conquering the weak, greed is good and over-the-top narcissism are the messages being conveyed to the young. But when I come along to show them there's a better world they can make for themselves, I get slapped with an ""R""-rating. Go figure. (BTW, I believe, depending on the maturity level of your kids, even 8 and 9-yr olds can understand and enjoy this film.)

So, high school students of America — go check out ""Where To Invade Next"" (here's the list of theaters showing it:http://wheretoinvadenext.com/#screenings). I promise you it'll be one of the best movies you'll see this year. I am so amazed at your generation — how aware you are of the world, how much you're concerned about your future, how into the election year you are, and mostly how you are not a generation of haters. You don't hate people because of the color of their skin or if they are in love with someone of their own gender. You don't want this country going to war. This is a HUGE shift from past generations and already I can see you're going to make this world a better place.

And remember – after you see my movie, don't forget to go out and raise your voice, disturb the status quo, and cause a ruckus. We need you.

Yours,
Michael Moore

I hope she doesn't mind, but I want to tell you this story about my producer, Tia Lessin. Her mother and grandmother were refugees who escaped the Holocaust on one of those infamous boats of Jews trying to flee Hitler's forces in the hopes of reaching a country that would take them in. But no one would let them land. Not the Brits, not the Americans, not anyone until they finally reached the last island nation in the southern Caribbean, Trinidad & Tobago. They were the only ones who let them dock. They took them in, fed them, gave them shelter, and issued them the legal papers they needed so they could stay. And in doing so, Tia's mother and grandmother got to live. No thanks to the USA who had refused their admittance. Eventually, after a few years, they did emigrate, as ""citizens"" of Trinidad. Tia's grandmother is gone now, but her mother is still with us, and it is with a happy tear in my eye that I think of her on this night which she probably never thought she'd live to see happen, a night when the people of a certain American state said they'd like this Jewish man to lead their country. Maybe it was made right, in some small way, tonight. Either way, I'm lucky to have the child of these survivors as my co-worker on this and most of my films since 1995. 

Tonight, it makes me proud to be an American.

Friends,

Thank you to all who have written to me about my stay this past week in the intensive care unit. Unfortunately, as you may have heard, I came down with pneumonia. Truth be told, it was pretty serious, and other complications arose. But then, five days later, I was still alive — thanks to a combination of Directors Guild insurance, two I-V drips of alleged legal drugs, and a hospital TV that only got FOX News. I was released on my own recognizance, which I tried to explain may not be the best idea. I am now at home resting and binging on the Real Housewives of The Walking Dead. All my appearances this week and last week supporting the release of my brand new movie, ""Where To Invade Next"" (Conan, Bill Maher, Charlie Rose, NPR, etc.), plus a special primary eve screening tonight in New Hampshire, were and are cancelled.
Needless to say, I'm pretty devastated. This film means a lot to me. To be sidelined – I can't fly, I can't travel, I can't leave the house – in this, the most important week before it comes out… well, you can imagine what I'm going through. Trying to get back to just breathing is enough of a burden. To think that my film may now not reach the audience I made it for, let's just say that doesn't help the healing process.

Many of you have asked if there's anything you can do to help me. I have thought about it – and, yes, actually, there is something you could do to help me.

I need you to be part of a quickly cobbled-together ""army"" of grassroots ""ambassadors"" who can do the work I was going to do this week to let people know abut the movie and convince as many as possible to go see it. I realize you haven't seen ""Where To Invade Next"", so I'm asking you to do this based upon my past work and your hope that I've made a compelling film that might affect change in this country, that will inspire people to think about things in a different way. I believe that's exactly what I've done, and many who've seen it agree (LINK). I also believe this movie can have a huge impact on the elections this year. It's won a bunch of film festival prizes, it's made the Oscars shortlist, and some have called it my best film ever. Possibly, just possibly.
But forget all that. Here's what I will tell you: You are going to be seriously f***ed up by this film. It's unlike anything I've ever done. It will truly make your head spin for two hours while you ""laugh AND cry — in the same exact moment,"" as an audience member said to the cameras on the way out of the movie's premiere.

Last week, laying in the hospital, I watched one Presidential candidate attack the candidate from Vermont for his ideas being ""unrealistic,"" ""pie in the sky,"" and ""ideas that sound good on paper, but aren't going to happen."" The truth is, all these great ""ideas"" – free universal health care, free university, free day care, taxing and policing hedge fund millionaires – have already happened in nearly every other industrialized country in the world! And I have the evidence – and the film — to prove it! Throughout ""Where To Invade Next"", I invade a whole bunch of nefarious countries, from Slovenia to Germany to France to Norway, and pry loose from them the tools they've been using to make their countries happy, shiny places. My goal: to show millions of Americans what these countries have been hiding from us so we can catch up and be #1 again! Remember ""WE'RE #1!!""? Don't you miss being #1 and waving those big foam #1 fingers at patriotic rallies? In my invasions, I don't use any weapons, and no one gets droned. I show how to actually make all universities free (and great); how to give all workers five to eight weeks PAID vacation (which increases productivity and betters the economy); how simple and easy it is to give mothers (or fathers) up to a year of PAID maternity leave (which in turn benefits the company overall); how in the societies where woman have achieved true equality and power, everything just seems to get better for everyone; how to reduce the crime rate by ending the war on drugs and having a humane prison system (our recidivism rate is as high as 80%; theirs is 20%); how the economy bounces back faster and is safer when bankers are put in prison; how students in countries without standardized tests and needless homework perform better than our students (and that countries which have more arts and music in their schools do better in math and science)… and on and on and on. By the end of the movie, you'll want to go live in one of those countries. But instead, I'll show you how we can make all of that happen right here in the USA, right now.

So, what do you think? Can you be a virtual ambassador for ""Where To Invade Next""? I know you can't go on ""Good Morning America"" for me, but there are a few easy things you could do right now from your computer or mobile device.

Here's how you can help ""Where To Invade Next:""

First, go see it! Text some friends right now and say, ""hey, let's go see this Friday night!"" Commit now to go to a theater that's playing it this coming weekend. It's opening in every major and mini-major city in the country. If you live in a place the size of Binghamton, NY, or Grand Rapids, MI, then they're going to be playing ""Where To Invade Next."" The final list of theaters will be out later tomorrow, but here's a partial one for now (LINK).

Right now, you can TWEET the following: "".@MMFlint's 1st film is coming out in 6 years and he needs our help with #WhereToInvadeNext! Read & RT! http://michaelmoore.com/WhereToInvadeNextArmy/""

Right now, you can FACEBOOK the following: ""Michael Moore's 1st film is coming out in 6 years and he needs our help with #WhereToInvadeNext! Read & Share! http://michaelmoore.com/WhereToInvadeNextArmy/""

In this link: http://michaelmoore.com/WhereToInvadeNextArmy/ is the hi-res version of the film's poster! Feel free to send it around, post it on your social media, download it and print up some flyers, or use it graphically any way that you want.

Send the trailer to everyone on your contact list: (https://youtube.com/watch?v=r4JJvfrkH3M)

Over the next few days I'll send you other things you can do, like organizing screening parties for this weekend, sending me photos from your theater that I can post, and sharing with your friends exclusive clips from the film which I'll send you.

If a few thousand of you suddenly became champions and ambassadors for ""Where To Invade Next"", then maybe we can pull this off. I certainly would be forever in your debt. Thanks for being there for me.

So with nothing to do but recover (and I am ), one of my great editors, Pablo Proenza, & I decided to make a music video for Flint (thanks to Carl & Tia for all the clips).

24674986856_10153274348606857,"I'm writing this to all of you today (Thurs) from the Intensive Care Unit at a hospital in New York City. Unfortunately, I've come down with pneumonia. Between running all over the place lately promoting my new movie (WHERE TO INVADE NEXT), plus going to Flint to help the people of my hometown, plus jumping in to support Senator Sanders, plus doing a dozen other things -- well, I read somewhere you can't burn it at both ends, and if u do, it's best not to do so in the winter nor anywhere near a place full of toxic water!

The truth is, I've actually been in the ICU since Sunday night. Let's just say things didn't look good Sunday night. But thanks to a combination of good doctors, decent hospital food and 2nd-term Obamacare, I'm doing much better the last couple of days -- so much so that I'm being discharged later today. I'm to return home and rest for the coming days. All appearances for the rest of this week have been canceled. 

Needless to say, in addition to being a bummer health-wise (and I'm trying out a new thing this week by putting that, my health, first), this is a huge loss to my efforts in leading up to the release of my new movie next Friday. I was supposed to be in LA tonight (Thurs) to be on Conan, and tomorrow night I was making my return after two years to the Bill Maher show on HBO (and thank you, Erin Brockovich, for going on in my place to talk about the situation in Flint!). 

Since I mentioned my predicament earlier today on Twitter and Facebook (or perhaps you heard about it in the media
http://detne.ws/1T1Dtjs), many of you have sent me very nice well wishes (thank you!) and have asked if there's anything you could do to help me. Actually, there is. 

I have to be honest, with my absence this week (and probably into next), I'm now worried about my film's release. I can't fly, I have to recover, and in one week (February 12th) this great movie I've put so much of my life into is going to open in theaters -- with little or no assistance from me. So, would it be OK to enlist your help in a sort of quickly cobbled-together ""army"" of grassroots foot soldiers, wherein you could pitch in where you live (and on socila media) to let people know about my movie? I could post some ideas tomorrow of things you and your friends could do. Things like:
 -- share the trailer with others (https://youtube.com/watch?v=r4JJvfrkH3M);
 -- send around the movie's poster (see below);
 -- show or place the 30-second ad wherever you can (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7wbH9Bjbyww);
 -- forward reviews of the film to friends and family (http://www.salon.com/2015/11/04/michael_moores_gutsy_new_film_our_military_has_not_won_a_war_since_world_war_ii/). 

I know this seems a bit unorthodox, and I've never seen a request like this made before by a director (then again, I could just be on the wrong drugs), but this is the age of social media and we're all trying lots of new ways to do things, aren't we? So why not just appoint each of you as the local PR person for WHERE TO INVADE NEXT, seeing how I can't make it there in person? This will take a HUGE burden off me and give the movie a chance to be seen by millions.

My other problem is that the distributor hired to release the film is a new start-up company still in formation (the company doesn't even have a name yet). So their plan all along was essentially to have me do most of the work by running back and forth across the country doing interviews and screenings. Naturally, I loved this plan, but none of us stopped to think what would happen if... I got pneumonia! So, they're doing their best now (these are the brave people who worked on the release of the Edward Snowden documentary, ""Citizen Four""). If a few thousand of you suddenly became champions and spokespeople for the film, then maybe I/we can pull this off. I would be forever in your debt. 

I do need to get some sleep, so I'll sign off for now. Check back with me tomorrow (Friday) for further updates and ideas. Thanks for offering to help. Stay warm, drink plenty of fluids, and let's get back to our nightly walks!

Best,

24674986856_10153262517046857,"MY NEW LETTER: ""10 Things They Won't Tell You About the Flint Water Tragedy. But I Will."" -- Here's a link to the letter on my site: http://michaelmoore.com/10FactsOnFlint/ -- Read, Sign Our Petition, & Share this!

News of the poisoned water crisis in Flint has reached a wide audience around the world. The basics are now known: the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, nullified the free elections in Flint, deposed the mayor and city council, then appointed his own man to run the city. To save money, they decided to unhook the people of Flint from their fresh water drinking source, Lake Huron, and instead, make the public drink from the toxic Flint River. When the governor's office discovered just how toxic the water was, they decided to keep quiet about it and covered up the extent of the damage being done to Flint's residents, most notably the lead affecting the children, causing irreversible and permanent brain damage. Citizen activists uncovered these actions, and the governor now faces growing cries to resign or be arrested.

Here are ten things that you probably don't know about this crisis because the media, having come to the story so late, can only process so much. But if you live in Flint or the State of Michigan as I do, you know all to well that what the greater public has been told only scratches the surface.

1) While the Children in Flint Were Given Poisoned Water to Drink, General Motors Was Given a Special Hookup to the Clean Water.      

A few months after Governor Snyder removed Flint from the clean fresh water we had been drinking for decades, the brass from General Motors went to him and complained that the Flint River water was causing their car parts to corrode when being washed on the assembly line. The Governor was appalled to hear that GM property was being damaged, so he jumped through a number of hoops and quietly spent $440,000 to hook GM back up to the Lake Huron water, while keeping the rest of Flint on the Flint River water. Which means that while the children in Flint were drinking lead-filled water, there was one -- and only one -- address in Flint that got clean water: the GM factory. 

2) For Just $100 a Day, This Crisis Could've Been Prevented. 

Federal law requires that water systems which are sent through lead pipes must contain an additive that seals the lead into the pipe and prevents it from leaching into the water. Someone at the beginning suggested to the Governor that they add this anti-corrosive element to the water coming out of the Flint River. ""How much would that cost?"" came the question. ""$100 a day for three months,"" was the answer. I guess that was too much, so, in order to save $9,000, the state government said f*** it -- and as a result the State may now end up having to pay upwards of $1.5 billion to fix the mess.

3) There's More Than the Lead in Flint's Water. 

In addition to exposing every child in the city of Flint to lead poisoning on a daily basis, there appears to be a number of other diseases we may be hearing about in the months ahead. The number of cases in Flint of Legionnaires Disease has increased tenfold since the switch to the river water. Eighty-seven people have come down with it, and at least ten have died. In the five years before the river water, not a single person in Flint had died of Legionnaires Disease. Doctors are now discovering that another half-dozen toxins are being found in the blood of Flint's citizens, causing concern that there are other health catastrophes which may soon come to light.

4) People's Homes in Flint Are Now Worth Nothing Because They Cant Be Sold. 

Would you buy a house in Flint right now? Who would? So every homeowner in Flint is stuck with a house that's now worth nothing. That's a total home value of $2.4 billion down the economic drain. People in Flint, one of the poorest cities in the U.S., don't have much to their name, and for many their only asset is their home. So, in addition to being poisoned, they have now a net worth of zero. (And as for employment, who is going to move jobs or start a company in Flint under these conditions? No one.) Has Flint's future just been flushed down that river?

5) While They Were Being Poisoned, They Were Also Being Bombed. 

Here's a story which has received little or no coverage outside of Flint. During these two years of water contamination, residents in Flint have had to contend with a decision made by the Pentagon to use Flint for target practice. Literally. Actual unannounced military exercises – complete with live ammo and explosives – were conducted last year inside the city of Flint. The army decided to practice urban warfare on Flint, making use of the thousands of abandoned homes which they could drop bombs on. Streets with dilapidated homes had rocket-propelled grenades fired upon them. For weeks, an undisclosed number of army troops pretended Flint was Baghdad or Damascus and basically had at it. It sounded as if the city was under attack from an invading army or from terrorists. People were shocked this could be going on in their neighborhoods. Wait – did I say ""people?"" I meant, Flint people. As with the Governor, it was OK to abuse a community that held no political power or money to fight back. BOOM!

6) The Wife of the Governor's Chief of Staff Is a Spokeswoman for Nestle, Michigan's Largest Owner of Private Water Reserves. 

As Deep Throat told Woodward and Bernstein: ""Follow the money."" Snyder's chief of staff throughout the two years of Flint's poisoning, Dennis Muchmore, was intimately involved in all the decisions regarding Flint. His wife is Deb Muchmore, who just happens to be the spokesperson in Michigan for the Nestle Company – the largest owner of private water sources in the State of Michigan. Nestle has been repeatedly sued in northern Michigan for the 200 gallons of fresh water per minute it sucks from out of the ground and bottles for sale as their Ice Mountain brand of bottled spring water. The Muchmores have a personal interest in seeing to it that Nestles grabs as much of Michigan's clean water was possible – especially when cities like Flint in the future are going to need that Ice Mountain.

7) In Michigan, from Flint water, to Crime and Murder, to GM Ignition Switches, It's a Culture of Death. 

It's not just the water that was recklessly used to put people's lives in jeopardy. There are many things that happen in Flint that would give one the impression that there is a low value placed on human life. Flint has one of the worst murder and crime rates in the country. Just for context, if New York City had the same murder rate as Flint, Michigan, the number of people murdered last year in New York would have been almost 4,000 people – instead of the actual 340 who were killed in NYC in 2015. But it's not just street crime that makes one wonder about what is going on in Michigan. Last year, it was revealed that, once again, one of Detroit's automakers had put profit ahead of people's lives. General Motors learned that it had installed faulty ignition switches in many of its cars. Instead of simply fixing the problem, mid-management staff covered it up from the public. The auto industry has a history of weighing the costs of whether it's cheaper to spend the money to fix the defect in millions of cars or to simply pay off a bunch of lawsuits filed by the victims surviving family members. Does a cynical, arrogant culture like this make it easy for a former corporate CEO, now Governor, turn a blind eye to the lead that is discovered in a municipality's drinking water?

8) Don't Call It ""Detroit Water"" -- It's the Largest Source of Fresh Drinking Water in the World. 

The media keeps saying Flint was using ""Detroit's water."" It is only filtered and treated at the Detroit Water Plant. The water itself comes from Lake Huron, the third largest body of fresh water in the world. It is a glacial lake formed over 10,000 years ago during the last Ice Age and it is still fed by pure underground springs. Flint is geographically the last place on Earth where one should be drinking poisoned water. 

9) ALL the Children Have Been Exposed, As Have All the Adults, Including Me. 

That's just a fact. If you have been in Flint anytime from April 2014 to today, and you've drank the water, eaten food cooked with it, washed your clothes in it, taken a shower, brushed your teeth or eaten vegetables from someone's garden, you've been exposed to and ingested its toxins. When the media says ""9,000 children under 6 have been exposed,"" that means ALL the children have been exposed because the total number of people under the age of 6 in Flint is… 9,000! The media should just say, ""all."" When they say ""47 children have tested positive"", that's just those who've drank the water in the last week or so. Lead enters the body and does it's damage to the brain immediately. It doesn't stay in the blood stream for longer than a few days and you can't detect it after a month. So when you hear ""47 children"", that's just those with an exposure in the last 48 hours. It's really everyone.

10) This Was Done, Like So Many Things These Days, So the Rich Could Get a Big Tax Break. 

When Governor Snyder took office in 2011, one of the first things he did was to get a multi-billion dollar tax break passed by the Republican legislature for the wealthy and for corporations. But with less tax revenues, that meant he had to start cutting costs. So, many things – schools, pensions, welfare, safe drinking water – were slashed. Then he invoked an executive privilege to take over cities (all of them majority black) by firing the mayors and city councils whom the local people had elected, and installing his cronies to act as ""dictators"" over these cities. Their mission? Cut services to save money so he could give the rich even more breaks. That's where the idea of switching Flint to river water came from. To save $15 million! It was easy. Suspend democracy. Cut taxes for the rich. Make the poor drink toxic river water. And everybody's happy.

Except those who were poisoned in the process. All 102,000 of them. In the richest country in the world.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/photos/a.10150288227701857.331023.24674986856/10153262517046857/?type=3,2016-01-29 10:16:38,12249,1760,14007,12249,0,0,0,0,0

""Do Not Send Us Bottles Of Water. Instead, Join Us In A Revolt.""
A Letter From Michael Moore

Many of you have contacted me wanting to know how you can help the people of Flint with the two-year long tragedy of drinking water contaminated by the radical decisions made by the Governor of Michigan. The offer is much appreciated by those who are suffering through this and who have not drank a glass of unpoisoned water since April of 2014.

Unfortunately, the honest answer to your offer of help is, sadly, you can't.

You can't help.

The reason you can't help is that you cannot reverse the irreversible brain damage that has been inflicted upon every single child in Flint. The damage is permanent. There is no medicine you can send, no doctor or scientist who has any way to undo the harm done to thousands of babies, toddlers and children (not to mention their parents). They are ruined for life, and someone needs to tell you the truth about that. They will, forever, suffer from various neurological impediments, their IQs will be lowered by at least 20 points, they will not do as well in school and, by the time they reach adolescence, they will exhibit various behavioral problems that will land a number of them in trouble, and some of them in jail.

That is what we know about the history of lead poisoning when you inflict it upon a child. It is a life sentence. In Flint, they've already ingested it for these two years, and the toll has already been taken on their developing brains. No check you write, no truckloads of Fiji Water or Poland Spring, will bring their innocence or their health back to normal. It's done. And it was done knowingly, enacted by a political decision from a Governor and a political party charged by the majority of Michigan's citizens who elected them to cut taxes for the rich, take over majority-black cities by replacing the elected mayors and city councils, cut costs, cut services, cut more taxes for the rich, increase taxes on retired teachers and public employees and, ultimately, try to decimate their one line of defense against all this, this thing we used to call a union.

The amount of generosity since the national media finally started to cover this story has been tremendous. Pearl Jam sent 100,000 bottles of water. The next day the Detroit Lions showed up with a truck and 100,000 bottles of water. Yesterday, Puff Daddy and Mark Wahlberg donated 1,000,000 bottles of water! Unbelievably amazing. They acknowledged it's a very short-term fix, and that it is. Flint has 102,000 residents, each in need of an average of 50 gallons of water a day for cooking, bathing, washing clothes, doing the dishes, and drinking (I'm not counting toilet flushes, watering plants or washing the car). But 100,000 bottles of water is enough for just one bottle per person – in other words, just enough to cover brushing one's teeth for one day. You would have to send 200 bottles a day, per person, to cover what the average American (we are Americans in Flint) needs each day. That's 102,000 citizens times 200 bottles of water – which equals 20.4 million 16oz. bottles of water per day, every day, for the next year or two until this problem is fixed (oh, and we'll need to find a landfill in Flint big enough for all those hundreds of millions of plastic water bottles, thus degrading the local environment even further). Anybody want to pony up for that? Because THAT is the reality.

This is a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. There is not a terrorist organization on Earth that has yet to figure out how to poison 100,000 people every day for two years – and get away with it. That took a Governor who subscribes to an American political ideology hell-bent on widening the income inequality gap and conducting various versions of voter and electoral suppression against people of color and the poor. It was those actions that led Michigan's Republican Governor to try out his economic and racial experiment in Flint (and please don't tell me this has nothing to do with race or class; he has removed the mayors of a number of black cities. This, and the water crisis in Flint, never would have been visited upon the residents of Bloomfield Hills or Grosse Pointe -- and everyone here knows that). We have now seen the ultimate disastrous consequences of late-20th century, neo-conservative, trickle down public policy. That word ""trickle,"" a water-based metaphor, was used to justify this economic theory -- well, it's no longer a metaphor, is it? Because now we're talking about how actual water has been used to institute these twisted economic beliefs in destroying the lives of the black and the poor in Flint, Michigan.

So, do you still want to help? Really help? Because what we need in Flint – and across the country – right now, tonight, is a nonviolent army of people who are willing to stand up for this nation, and go to bat for the forgotten of Flint.

Here's what you and I need to do:

1) Demand the removal and arrest of Rick Snyder, the Governor of Michigan. When the police have an ""active shooter"" situation in a building, they must first stop the shooter before they can bring aid to the victims. The perp who allowed the poisoning to continue once he knew something was wrong -- and his minions who cooked the evidence so the public and the feds wouldn't find out – must be removed from office ASAP. Whether it's via resignation, recall or prosecution, this must happen now because he is still refusing to take the aggressive and immediate action needed. His office, as recently as this past Thursday, was claiming the EPA had no legal authority to tell him what to do. You know the EPA -- that federal agency every Republican politician wants eliminated? Governor Snyder is not going to obey the law. He has covered up the crime, and I submit he has committed an act of voluntary or involuntary manslaughter. Last month I posted a meme of me holding a pair of handcuffs with the hashtag #ArrestGovSnyder. It went viral, so I posted a petition (http://michaelmoore.com/ArrestGovSnyder) to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking her to arrest the Governor – and asking President Obama to send help to Flint immediately. As each day brought a new revelation of the Governor's corruption or incompetence, and with Rachel Maddow on a nightly tear, the momentum built. MoveOn.org and Democracy For America joined me in circulating our petition. We are now on our way to having a half-million signatures! Then Bernie Sanders became the first candidate to call for the Governor's removal. That same day, President Obama issued his first emergency order for Flint. The next night, Hillary Clinton fiercely called out the racist actions of the Governor.

You want to help? Sign the petition (http://www.michaelmoore.com/DontSendBottledWater) – and get everyone you know to sign it. Now. Another half-million signatures could become the tipping point we need. All eyes are on Flint.

2) Make the State of Michigan pay for the disaster that the State of Michigan created. The Governor wants the President to declare Flint a federal disaster zone and have him send federal money to fix the problem. Not so fast. All relief aid for Flint currently coming from the federal government to Michigan is going through the Governor's office to disburse. That is literally paying the fox to fix the chicken coop he destroyed. As a Michigan resident and voter, I think that the people who elected Governor Snyder must show some of that personal responsibility they're always lecturing about to the poor. The majority of my fellow Michiganders wanted this kind of government (they elected him twice), so now they should have to pay for it. This year the state treasury posted nearly a $600 million surplus. There is also another $600 million in the state's ""rainy day fund"". That's $1.2 billion – just about what Flint's congressman, Dan Kildee, estimates it will cost to replace the water infrastructure and care for the thousands of poisoned children throughout their growing years.

And before there is any talk of federal tax dollars being used (and, yes, they will be needed), the state legislature must remove the billion-dollars' worth of tax cuts the Snyder administration gave the wealthy when he took office. That will go a long way to helping not just Flint but Michigan's other destitute cities and school districts.

3) The Federal Government must then be placed in charge. The State government cannot be trusted to get this right. So, instead of declaring a federal disaster zone, President Obama must declare the same version of martial law that Governor Snyder declared over the cities of Flint and Detroit. He must step in and appoint a federal emergency manager in the state capitol to direct the resources of both the state and federal government in saving Flint. This means immediately sending in FEMA in full force. It means sending in the CDC to determine the true extent of not just the lead poisoning in the water, but also the latest outbreak that has been discovered in Flint – a tenfold increase in the number of Flint people who've contracted Legionnaires Disease. There have now been 87 cases since the switch to the Flint River water, and ten people have died. The local hospital has also noted sharp increases in a half-dozen other toxins found in people's bodies. We need the CDC. The EPA must take over the testing of the water, and the Army Corps of Engineers must be sent in to begin replacing the underground pipes. Like the levees in New Orleans, this will be a massive undertaking. If it is turned over to for-profit businesses, it will take a decade and cost billions. This needs to happen right now and Obama must be in charge.

4) Evacuate any and all Flint residents who want to leave now. They've suffered long enough and, until the water is truly safe, no one should have to stay there who doesn't want to. The state and FEMA should move people into nearby white townships that are still hooked up to Lake Huron water.

5) For those who choose to stay in Flint, FEMA must create a temporary water system in each home. One idea that has been suggested is to deliver two 55-gallon drums to every home in Flint. Each day water trucks will arrive to fill them with fresh clean glacial water from Lake Huron. The drums will have taps attached to them. People can't be expected to carry jugs of water from buildings that are miles away.

In the end, we will need to create a new economy and bring new employment to this town that created the middle class, that elected the first black mayor, and that believed in and created the American Dream. They deserved more than to be poisoned by their own Governor -- a Governor who thought that, because the people in the town were politically weak, he could get away with this unnoticed and without a fight. He figured wrong.

A crime against humanity has been committed against the people of Flint, making them refugees in their own homes. Tell me honestly: if you were living in Flint right now, and you learned that your children had been drinking lead-filled water for two years, and then you discovered that the Governor knew this and the state lied about it – tell me, just how fast would your head be spinning? With your children now poisoned, and with the poisoning continuing… is the word ""nonviolence"" dominating your thoughts right now? Are you absolutely, stunningly amazed how peaceful the people in Flint have remained? Are you curious how much longer that can last? I hope it does. If you want to help Flint, sign the petition, demand that the federal government take action, and then get involved yourself, wherever you live, so that this doesn't happen to you – and so that the people we elect know they can no longer break the law as they rule by fiat or indifference. We deserve much better than this.

For a better world,

Dear President Obama,

I am writing this to you from the place where I was born -- Flint, Michigan. Please consider this personal appeal from me and the 102,000 citizens of the city of Flint who have been poisoned -- not by a mistake, not by a natural disaster, but by a governor and his administration who, to ""cut costs,"" took over the city of Flint from its duly elected leaders, unhooked the city from its fresh water supply of Lake Huron, and then made the people drink the toxic water from the Flint River. This was nearly two years ago.

This week it was revealed that at least 10 people in Flint have now been killed by these premeditated actions of the Governor of Michigan. This governor, Rick Snyder, nullified the democratic election of this mostly African-American city -- where 41% of the people live below the ""official"" poverty line -- and replaced the elected Mayor and city council with a crony who was instructed to take all his orders from the governor's office.

One of those orders from the State of Michigan was this: ""It costs too much money to supply Flint with clean drinking water from Lake Huron (the 3rd largest body of fresh water in the world). We can save a lot of money doing this differently. So unhook the city from that source and let them drink the water known as 'General Motors' Sewer' -- the Flint River.""

And, lo and behold, the Governor was right. It was a lot cheaper! Fifteen million dollars cheaper! And for saving all that money, it is now estimated that to repair the damaged water system in Flint, it will cost at least $1.5 billion. Someone had suggested to the governor, before he did this, that the river contained many toxins. He ignored that. One of his own people said maybe they should add a safe-to-drink ""corrosive protector"" to the water so that the toxins in said water wouldn't leach the lead off the aging water pipe infrastructure and into the drinking water. ""How much will that cost?"" asked the governor's office.

""Just $100 a day for only 3 months,"" the governor was told. Oh, $100 a day?! THAT'S TOO MUCH!, came the reply from the governor. Don't worry about the lead. ""Lead is a seasonal thing,"" he would later explain to the public. ""Heck, there's lead in everything!"" Just let them drink the river water.

This is a city full of poor black people, a city where half the population (including myself) found a way to escape the misery and the madness (the crime rate is so bad, we've lead the country in murders for most years -- and just to get an idea of what that means, if NYC had the same murder rate as Flint last year, over 4,000 New Yorkers would have been killed, instead of the 340 who actually were).

My city has been pummeled by General Motors, Wall Street and the State and Federal governments. It's no surprise that the Republicans who control our State Capitol in Michigan didn't have to worry about any push-back from the residents of Flint because, to them, that's just a bunch of eviscerated black people who have absolutely no power, ""don't vote for us any way,"" and have NO means to fight back.

And now, after every single child in Flint has been poisoned with lead-filled water that the State knew a year ago was in that water, we learn that the governor's office sought to cover it up, hiding it not just from the defenseless African Americans they secretly fear and despise, but also hiding it from YOU and the federal government!

And, as if things couldn't get any worse, the news of 87 people with Legionnaires Disease happened this week. Ten Flint residents have been KILLED by this disease which is caused by tainted water. Not by gun violence, not in Afghanistan, but by an act of racism and violence perpetrated by the -- I'm sorry to say -- white, Republican governor of Michigan who knew months ago the water was toxic.

All fingers from the doctors and scientists point to the filthy, toxic Flint River as the cause of this Legionnaires Disease outbreak. 10 human souls deceased. In an average year, Flint already had an astounding 8 cases (and rarely a death) of people contracting Legionnaires Disease. Since the citizens of Flint were forced to use the water from the Flint River, EIGHTY-SEVEN CASES OF LEGIONNAIRES DISEASE have happened! AND TEN DEATHS! And the number is expected to rise.

President Obama -- the people of Flint are crying out to you for help. Our Congressman, Dan Kildee, has called the federal government for assistance. But he's been told that it's a ""State issue"" and that ""the State of Michigan has to be the one asking the feds for the help.""

NO! The STATE is the one who CAUSED THIS! That's like asking the fox if he could repair the chicken coop. No, Mr. President, we need YOUR help -- TODAY. 100,000 people have no water to drink, to cook with or to bathe in.

This week, you are coming to Michigan to attend the Detroit Auto Show. We implore you to come to Flint, less than an hour's drive north of Detroit. Do not ignore this tragedy taking place every day. This may be Gov. Snyder's Katrina, but it will become your Bush-Flying-Over-New Orleans Moment if you come to Michigan and then just fly away. I know you don't want that image of flying over us as you ""fake-sad"" look down on Flint just as Bush did in that never-to-be-forgotten photo-op over New Orleans. I know you are going to come to the rescue here in Flint. I can't imagine any other scenario.

We need:

1) The CDC here at once to truly assess all of the disease and damage that has been forced upon the people of Flint.

2) FEMA has to supply large water containers in every home in Flint -- and they must be filled by water trucks until the new infrastructure is resolved.

3) The EPA must take over matters from the State (can the governor be removed and replaced like he did to the mayor of Flint?). Immediately.

4) You must send in the Army Corps of Engineers to build that new water infrastructure. Otherwise, you might as well just evacuate all the people from Flint and move them to a white city that has clean drinking water -- and where this would never happen.

President Obama, I'm counting on you to give us a response. Can we expect to see you, in Flint, in the next few days?

Yours,
Michael Moore

24674986856_10153223367636857,"Today, I'm calling on U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate Michigan Governor Rick Snyder for poisoning the children of Flint. I wrote a letter to the Governor below and you can sign my petition here: http://michaelmoore.com/ArrestGovSnyder #ArrestGovSnyder

Dear Governor Snyder:

Thanks to you, sir, and the premeditated actions of your administrators, you have effectively poisoned, not just some, but apparently ALL of the children in my hometown of Flint, Michigan.

And for that, you have to go to jail.

To poison all the children in an historic American city is no small feat. Even international terrorist organizations haven't figured out yet how to do something on a magnitude like this.

But you did. Your staff and others knew that the water in the Flint River was poison -- but you decided that taking over the city and ""cutting costs"" to ""balance the budget"" was more important than the people's health (not to mention their democratic rights to elect their own leaders). So you cut off the clean, fresh glacial lake water of Lake Huron that the citizens of Flint (including myself) had been drinking for decades and, instead, made them drink water from the industrial cesspool we call the Flint River -- a body of ""water"" where toxins from a dozen General Motors and DuPont factories have been dumped for over a hundred years. And then you decided to put a chemical in this water to ""clean"" it -- which only ended up stripping the lead off of Flint's aging water pipes, placing that lead in the water and sending it straight into people's taps. Your callous -- and reckless (btw, ""reckless"" doesn't get you a pass; a reckless driver who kills a child, still goes to jail) -- decision to do this has now, as revealed by the city's top medical facility, caused ""irreversible brain damage"" in Flint's children, not to mention other bodily damage to all of Flint's adults. Here's how bad it is: Even GM won't let the auto parts they use in building cars touch the Flint water because that water ""corrodes"" them. This is a company that won't even fix an ignition switch after they've discovered it's already killed dozens of people. THAT's how bad the situation is. Even GM thinks you're the devil.

Maybe you don't understand the science behind this. Lead, in water -- now, bear with me, this involves a science lesson and you belong to the anti-science party, the one that believes there's not a climate problem and that Adam and Eve rode on dinosaurs 6,000 years ago. Lead is toxic to the human body. There's no way to fully eliminate it once it's in your system, and children are the most damaged by it.

By taking away the city's clean drinking water in order to ""cut costs,"" and then switching the city's water supply to Flint River water, you have allowed massively unsafe levels of pollutants and lead into the water that travels in to everyone's home. Every Flint resident is trapped by this environmental nightmare which you, Governor, have created.

Like any real criminal, when you were confronted with the truth (by the EPA and other leading water experts across America), you denied what you did. Even worse, you decided to mock your accusers and their findings. As I said, I know you don't like to believe in a lot of science (after all, you used to run Gateway Computers, and that, really, is all anyone needs to know about you), but this time the science has caught up with you -- and this time, I hope, it's going to convict you.

The facts are all there, Mr. Snyder. Every agency involved in this scheme reported directly to you. The children of Flint didn't have a choice as to whether or not they were going to get to drink clean water. But soon it will be your turn to not have that choice about which water you'll be drinking. Because by this time next year, if there is an ounce of justice left in this land, the water you'll be drinking will be served to you from a tap inside Jackson Prison.

I am calling upon my fellow Michiganders -- and seekers of justice everywhere -- to petition U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, asking her to arrest you for corruption and assault (i.e., the physical assault you committed against the children of Flint when you knowingly poisoned them).

Yesterday, the federal prosecutor in Flint, after many of us had called for months for this action, finally opened up an investigation into the matter. Now we need your arrest, prosecution and conviction.

And who will be cheering on that day when you are fitted with a bright orange jumpsuit? The poor and minority communities of Michigan who've endured your dictatorial firing of their mayors and school boards so you could place your business friends in charge of their mostly-black cities. They know you never would have done this to a wealthy white suburb.

I welcome all to look at the appalling facts of this case, which have been reported brilliantly, especially here by the great Rachel Maddow. http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/watch/toxic-water-tragedy-points-directly-to-snyder-597037635687 Thank you, Rachel, for caring so deeply when the rest of the national television media didn't.

I'm asking everyone who agrees with me to sign on to this petition and call for your arrest, Governor Snyder. You are not allowed to run amok in my hometown like you have done. The children whom you have poisoned have to endure a life of pain and lower IQ's from your actions. You have destroyed a generation of children -- and for that, you must pay.

It is time for you to go to prison. Out of mercy, I'll ask that you have in your cell your own personal Gateway computer.

Sincerely,
Michael Moore
Flint native
Michigan resident and voter

24674986856_10153182868471857,"Today I went & stood in front of Trump Tower & held a sign until the police came. Then I went home & wrote Donald a letter. Here it is:

Dear Donald Trump:

You may remember (you do, after all, have a ""perfect memory!""), that we met back in November of 1998 in the green room of a talk show where we were both scheduled to appear one afternoon. But just before going on, I was pulled aside by a producer from the show who said that you were ""nervous"" about being on the set with me. She said you didn't want to be ""ripped apart"" and you wanted to be reassured I wouldn't ""go after you.""

""Does he think I'm going to tackle him and put him in a choke hold?"" I asked, bewildered.

""No,"" the producer replied, ""he just seems all jittery about you.""

""Huh. I've never met the guy. There's no reason for him to be scared,"" I said. ""I really don't know much about him other than he seems to like his name on stuff. I'll talk to him if you want me to.""

And so, as you may remember, I did. I went up and introduced myself to you. ""The producer says you're worried I might say or do something to you during the show. Hey, no offense, but I barely know who you are. I'm from Michigan. Please don't worry -- we're gonna get along just fine!""

You seemed relieved, then leaned in and said to me, ""I just didn't want any trouble out there and I just wanted to make sure that, you know, you and I got along. That you weren't going to pick on me for something ridiculous.""

""Pick on"" you? I thought, where are we, in 3rd grade? I was struck by how you, a self-described tough guy from Queens, seemed like such a fraidey-cat.

You and I went on to do the show. Nothing untoward happened between us. I didn't pull on your hair, didn't put gum on your seat. ""What a wuss,"" was all I remember thinking as I left the set.

And now, here we are in 2015 and, like many other angry white guys, you are frightened by a bogeyman who is out to get you. That bogeyman, in your mind, are all Muslims. Not just the ones who have killed, but ALL MUSLIMS.

Fortunately, Donald, you and your supporters no longer look like what America actually is today. We are not a country of angry white guys. Here's a statistic that is going to make your hair spin: Eighty-one percent of the electorate who will pick the president next year are either female, people of color, or young people between the ages of 18 and 35. In other words, not you. And not the people who want you leading their country.

So, in desperation and insanity, you call for a ban on all Muslims entering this country. I was raised to believe that we are all each other's brother and sister, regardless of race, creed or color. That means if you want to ban Muslims, you are first going to have to ban me. And everyone else.

We are all Muslim.

Just as we are all Mexican, we are all Catholic and Jewish and white and black and every shade in between. We are all children of God (or nature or whatever you believe in), part of the human family, and nothing you say or do can change that fact one iota. If you don't like living by these American rules, then you need to go to the time-out room in any one of your Towers, sit there, and think about what you've said.

And then leave the rest of us alone so we can elect a real president who is both compassionate and strong -- at least strong enough not to be all whiny and scared of some guy in a ballcap from Michigan sitting next to him on a talk show couch. You're not so tough, Donny, and I'm glad I got to see the real you up close and personal all those years ago.

We are all Muslim. Deal with it.

All my best,
Michael Moore

P.S. I'm asking everyone who reads this letter to go here (http://michaelmoore.com/weareallmuslim), and sign the following statement: ""WE ARE ALL MUSLIM"" -- and then post a photo of yourself holding a homemade sign saying ""WE ARE ALL MUSLIM"" on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram using the hashtag #WeAreAllMuslim.

24674986856_10153152366521857,"Friends,

This past Friday I sent a letter to Governor Rick Snyder, our governor here in Michigan. Earlier in the week he had joined with 25 other governors in telling the President that they would block Syrian refugees from settling in their states.

Will you join me in defying this act of bigotry?

Their actions are unconstitutional, and worse, immoral. I am going against this ""ban"" by offering to give up my apartment in Traverse City, MI, to Syrian refugees who are currently seeking entry into our country.

Here is the letter I sent to the governor:

****************************************************************************
Dear Gov. Snyder:
I just wanted to let you know that, contrary to your declaration of denying Syrian refugees a home in our state of Michigan, I myself am going to defy your ban and will offer MY home in Traverse City, Michigan, to those very Syrian refugees you've decided to keep out. I will contact the State Department to let them know I am happy to provide a safe haven to any Syrian refugee couple approved by the Obama administration's vetting procedures in which I have full faith and trust.

Your action is not only disgraceful, it is, as you know, unconstitutional (only the President has the legal right to decide things like this).

What you've done is anti-American. This is not who we are supposed to be. We are, for better and for worse, a nation of descendants of three groups: slaves from Africa who were brought here in chains and then forced to provide trillions of dollars of free labor to build this country; native peoples who were mostly exterminated by white Christians through acts of mass genocide; and immigrants from EVERYWHERE around the globe. In Michigan we are fortunate to count amongst us tens of thousands of Arab and Muslim Americans.

I'm disappointed in you, Governor Snyder, for your heartless and un-Christian actions, and for joining in with at least 25 other governors (all but one a Republican) who've decided to block legal Syrian refugees from coming into their states. Fortunately I'm an 
American and not a Republican.

Governor, count me out of whatever you think it means to be a Michigander. I look forward to welcoming Syrians to my home and I wholeheartedly encourage other Americans to do the same.

Michael Moore  

P.S. By the way, my 700-sq. ft. apartment in northern Michigan is a little small, but it's got cable, wi-fi and a new dishwasher! Also, no haters live on my floor! Stop by any time for a hot chocolate this winter.
****************************************************************************

I'm not kidding about this. I'm making my apartment in Michigan available, rent-free, for six months to a year until the Syrian family gets settled and is doing well on their own. My family came here from Ireland in the 1800s. I know what it was like for them. There was bigotry and harassment -- but there were also those who held out a helping hand. That I would have the chance to do the same thing for a new family of immigrants 150 years later is an honor. (Besides, legend has it that St. Patrick was originally from Syria/Lebanon -- so I'm just passing on the green!)

I've written to Secretary of State John Kerry informing him that my home is available to place a Syrian couple. I've also asked him to please speed up the process of admitting these refugees (it's taking 18 to 24 months right now, and that's unacceptable).

I'm asking anyone who can, anyone who has spare rooms in their homes or an empty apartment, cottage, or whatever, to make it available for Syrian and Iraqi refugees for between six months and a year while they're being settled in the U.S. If you can do this, would you please sign up on the #MyHomeIsOpen registry. http://michaelmoore.com/MyHomeIsOpen 

Your name and contact info will be kept private and will only be shared with the appropriate refugee agencies sanctioned and overseen by the Obama administration and its participating NGOs. They will contact you when they have refugees that they've vetted and need to be placed in homes.

THIS is what we want the ""American way"" to be from now on. No more war, or interfering in other people's lives, no more turning our backs on the messes that we've created.

Thanks for joining with me in this effort. We are, indeed, our brothers' and sisters' keepers. I can think of no better way to celebrate Thanksgiving and the holidays this year than by helping those who are suffering from the mistakes that have been made in our name.

All my best,
Michael Moore
Great-grandson of refugees and immigrants

I just wanted to let you know that, contrary to your declaration of denying Syrian refugees a home in our state of Michigan, I myself am going to defy your ban and will offer MY home in Traverse City, Michigan, to those very Syrian refugees you've decided to keep out. I will contact the State Department to let them know I am happy to provide a safe haven to any Syrian refugee couple approved by the Obama administration's vetting procedures in which I have full faith and trust. 

Your action is not only disgraceful, it is, as you know, unconstitutional (only the President has the legal right to decide things like this).

What you've done is anti-American. This is not who we are supposed to be. We are, for better and for worse, a nation of descendants of three groups: slaves from Africa who were brought here in chains and then forced to provide trillions of dollars of free labor to build this country; native peoples who were mostly exterminated by white Christians through acts of mass genocide; and immigrants from EVERYWHERE around the globe.

The screening sold out within the first hour, and I know many of you were disappointed you couldn't get in. I believe the festival will add another screening or two for next week, but in the meantime I wanted to do something special for all of my Canadian Facebook friends and the people who won't get a chance to see the film this week.

So, today I'm announcing a way for ANYONE to be able to hang out with me and my crew and talk movies and whatever. Free invite for everybody TODAY @ 4PM! Below are the details...

This is for anyone in the Toronto area this weekend...

Friday, Sept. 11th @ 4PM - You are all invited to my party after the Friday (Sept. 11th) screening. We are calling this event, the PEOPLE'S PARTY! It's free. You don't need to be a VIP. There's no velvet rope. It's enough if you'd just like to hang for a bit with me and my crew. The first 100 people who show up to this address below will get in to our private event and there will be food a drink on me! If you are 101 in line, don't worry there still a chance to get in! We are also saving 100 spots for this event for anyone who has a ticket to my Friday screening as well. 200 lucky spots for any folks who want to come down and hang out with us on our special day. Come on down and have a drink on me!

24674986856_10152896276351857,"Written in 1936, from the great African American poet, Langston Hughes...

""Let America Be America Again""

Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.

(America never was America to me.)

Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed—
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above.

(It never was America to me.)

O, let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.

(There's never been equality for me,
Nor freedom in this ""homeland of the free."")

Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark? 
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?

I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,
I am the Negro bearing slavery's scars.
I am the red man driven from the land,
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek—
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.

I am the young man, full of strength and hope,
Tangled in that ancient endless chain
Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!
Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!
Of work the men! Of take the pay!
Of owning everything for one's own greed!

I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.
I am the worker sold to the machine.
I am the Negro, servant to you all.
I am the people, humble, hungry, mean—
Hungry yet today despite the dream.
Beaten yet today—O, Pioneers!
I am the man who never got ahead,
The poorest worker bartered through the years.

Yet I'm the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned
That's made America the land it has become.
O, I'm the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home—
For I'm the one who left dark Ireland's shore,
And Poland's plain, and England's grassy lea,
And torn from Black Africa's strand I came
To build a ""homeland of the free.""

The free?

Who said the free?  Not me?
Surely not me?  The millions on relief today?
The millions shot down when we strike?
The millions who have nothing for our pay?
For all the dreams we've dreamed
And all the songs we've sung
And all the hopes we've held
And all the flags we've hung,
The millions who have nothing for our pay—
Except the dream that's almost dead today.

O, let America be America again—
The land that never has been yet—
And yet must be—the land where every man is free.
The land that's mine—the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's, ME—
Who made America,
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
Must bring back our mighty dream again.

Sure, call me any ugly name you choose—
The steel of freedom does not stain.
From those who live like leeches on the people's lives,
We must take back our land again,
America!

O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath—
America will be!

Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,
We, the people, must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.
The mountains and the endless plain—
All, all the stretch of these great green states—
And make America again!",Let America Be America Again | Academy of American Poets,link,http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/let-america-be-america-again,2015-07-04 22:36:52,5123,262,1439,5123,0,0,0,0,0

24674986856_10152893453636857,"This is to all of you who hope that once or twice a year a great film, a masterpiece, might come along. I may have one for you. It's one of the best films I've seen so far in 2015 -- actually, it's one of the best I've seen ever. 

It's ""Inside Out"".

Pixar has made a bold, brave, audacious and loving piece of cinema -- and I believe it will impact thousands (millions?) of young people for the rest of their lives. To have a movie tell them that sadness can be embraced and can help you, that anger sometimes comes in handy, that parents are only doing the best they can with what they have ""upstairs"" -- well, this is the kind of filmmaking that can make the world truly a better place. Not in the cliched way, but ACTUALLY affect and impact people's lives, their behavior and -- here's something few, if any, movies aspire to do -- improve a child's mental health! Yes, a movie! Unbelievable.

There wasn't animation in the time of Alfred Nobel, but had there been he surely would have made sure there was a special prize for the work the team at Pixar has done to enhance humanity and this world.

Adults, this is not just a kids movie. It is a MOVIE! You will be
cheating yourselves if you miss it. Laughter, tears, and immense hope by the end. And Lewis Black for Best Supporting Actor! Genius! I want to see more movies like this. 
It's a good weekend to go to the cinema. In addition to ""Inside Out"", there's also ""Love and Mercy"", ""Dope"", and if you haven't seen it already, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"".

24674986856_10152883409916857,"It was one of those weeks, this past week. A week in which we witnessed profound history being made. A week when a large chunk was taken out of the wall of hate that criss-crosses this country, a nation founded on genocide and built  on the backs of slaves. A people who pride themselves on being ignorant, and thus are easily manipulated with fear by those in power. We know the routine, we've tallied up the score. 

But now...

There is massive change in the air. While angry white men stew and wonder what happened to their roost, the young, the women, the working poor, the people of color have forged an intense political bond. Having raised their voices higher, having suddenly been filled more with a sense of hope than one of despair, this alliance is now poised to catapult further. Even in a month of unspeakable tragedy in the birthplace of the Civil War, the race war that one young man who was inspired by the politics of hate had hoped to ignite saw his sick dream backfire into a (nonviolent) war against racists. Blacks and whites have held hands in Charleston. Wal-mart and NASCAR have eliminated the Confederate flag. Two republicans on the Supreme Court have voted to support the vision of the black man who lives in a white house down the street. That wall of hate, devoid of any healthy foundation, has begun to crumble. It's a new America that is fighting its way out of the cocoon. On Thursday the Census Bureau announced that, for the first time ever, there are more millennials than baby boomers in the Untied States -- and, for the first time, there are now more children under 5 who are of color than those who are white. The paradigm has shifted; all we had to do was stay active, stay engaged, refrain from hate and then watch the decrepit right-wing ideology wither and fall off its mysoginist, homophobic, white-privileged vine. It is a New America, but it is not a free America - yet. Free of corporate control, free of Citizens United, free of income inequality, free of an ongoing environmental catastrophe, free of Jeb Bush, free of profit-making health insurance companies, free of a privatized prison system, free of a failed war on drugs, free of the scourge of capitalism. 

No, we're not free yet. But it's the closest we've ever been.

24674986856_10152576593336857,"The Day Clint Eastwood Said He Would ""Kill"" Me, 10 Years Ago This Week

A lot of people are asking me if this is true as this ""rumor"" about Clint Eastwood confronting me in 2005 has now re-surfaced and floated around the internet in the past few days. So I thought I should say a few words...

Ten years ago this past week, Clint Eastwood stood in front of the National Board of Review awards dinner and announced to me and to the crowd that he would ""kill"" me if I ever came to his house with my camera for an interview.

""I'll kill you,"" he declared. 

The crowd laughed nervously. As for me, having just experienced a half-dozen assaults in the previous year from crazies upset at 'Fahrenheit 9/11' and my anti-war Oscar speech, plus the attempt by a right wing extremist to blow up my house (he was caught in time and went to prison), I was a bit stunned to hear Eastwood, out of the blue, make such a violent statement. But I instantly decided he was just trying to be funny, so I laughed the same nervous laugh everyone else did. Clint, though, didn't seem to like all that laughter. 

""I mean it,"" he barked, and the audience grew more quiet. ""I'll shoot you.""

There was a smattering of approving applause, but most just turned around to see what my reaction was. I tried to keep that fake smile on my face so as to appear as if he hadn't ""gotten"" to me. But he had. I then mumbled to those sitting at my table. ""I think Dirty Harry just said, ""Make my day, punk.""

This story has received wider attention this week due to a piece in Salon by Penn State professor Sophia McClennen about 'American Sniper.' It reads in part:

   ""In order to have the bigger picture (of Clint Eastwood's thinking) we need to remember (some) key moments in recent Eastwood public appearances. The first took place in 2005 when Eastwood confronted filmmaker Michael Moore at the National Board of Review dinner, where both men were being honored. Moore was there for his documentary on the Iraq War, 'Fahrenheit 911.' Eastwood had 'Million Dollar Baby.' After Eastwood accepted his award, he directed comments at Moore. 'Michael Moore and I actually have a lot in common – we both appreciate living in a country where there's free expression.' Eastwood then added: 'But, Michael, if you ever show up at my front door with a camera – I'll kill you. I mean it.' The tone was I'm sort of joking, but maybe not really joking, provoking nervous laughter from both the audience and Moore himself.
   ""Eastwood said he would kill Moore if he showed up at his door. This was his response to a film that raised much-needed conversation about U.S. gun culture. Eastwood's reaction tells us a lot about the way that some members of the GOP treat those with whom they disagree. If you don't agree with me on guns, I'll just kill you."" http://www.salon.com/2015/01/26/american_snipers_biggest_lie_clint_eastwood_has_a_delusional_fox_news_problem/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=socialflow 

The fact-checking site, Snopes, weighed in also this week and declared the Eastwood ""I'll kill you"" statement to me to be TRUE: http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/eastwoodmoore.asp#JTLbvXWdOPxsvBGy.03 

I should probably stop here and say that I like Clint Eastwood and I think he was a great filmmaker. 'Unforgiven' is my favorite Western of all time. He also made a powerful film about the Japanese in World War II and portrayed them as human beings ('Letters from Iwo Jima'). Despite his own politics, he employs left-wing actors (Sean Penn and Tim Robbins both won Oscars in his ""Mystic River""). He has made films about the jazz great Charlie Parker (""Bird"") and Nelson Mandela (""Invictus""). 

But something started to go haywire with Clint in the last decade. Sophia McClennen in the Salon article wrote that she believes the first sign of his loopiness began that night at the awards dinner at Tavern on the Green in Central Park where he randomly went after me. Then came the (IMHO) awful (and weirdly racist) ""Gran Torino"" where he got to cast himself as a bigoted retired autoworker in Detroit. Two years later he was on the stage at the Republican National Convention carrying on a berating and confused conversation with an invisible Obama in an empty chair. 

And now 'American Sniper' - a mess of a film that rewrites history (we invade Iraq as revenge for 9/11), perpetuates a racist sentiment to Arabs (Iraqis are ""savages""), has a simplistic Hollywood storyline of the good sniper in white vs. the bad sniper in black), and (in a rare moment of honesty) shows the main characters in the film, the American soldiers, either returning home all messed-up by the war (and with some of them turning anti-war) or in a box. The lead character becomes a victim of both the PTSD epidemic AND the violent American/Texan gun culture that eventually takes his life. 

In the days to come I will post some thoughtful pieces here by others about 'American Sniper', and later this weekend one of my own. After all, I probably should share my real thoughts about this film now that Fox News and everyone on the Right has made up my review for me and told their Kool-Aid drinking audience what ""Michael Moore"" thinks of the movie.

Finally, what was bothersome ten years ago when Clint issued is half-kidding/not-kidding threat to me was that he was joining in on a theme others in the media were perpetuating -- the wishful idea of my untimely death. Glenn Beck summed it up best when he said this on his show:

 BECK: ""Hang on, let me just tell you what I'm thinking. I'm thinking
about killing Michael Moore, and I'm wondering if I could kill him myself,
or if I would need to hire somebody to do it. No, I think I could. I think
he could be looking me in the eye, you know, and I could just be choking the
life out -- is this wrong? I stopped wearing my What Would Jesus Do band, and I've lost all sense of right and wrong now. I used to be able to
say, ""Yeah, I'd kill Michael Moore,"" and then I'd see the little band: What
Would Jesus Do? And then I'd realize, ""Oh, you wouldn't kill Michael Moore.
Or at least you wouldn't choke him to death."" And you know, well, I'm not
sure."" http://mediamatters.org/research/200505180008 

And then there was Bill O'Reilly talking to Rudy Giuliani on his show: 

""Well, I want to kill Michael Moore, is that right? All right? And I
don't believe in capital punishment. That's a joke on Moore."" (Source: Entertainment Weekly)

Needless to say, this kind of thing wreaked all kinds of havoc in my life because of what this hate-speech does to inspire the more deranged among us.

This past week or so of hysterical attacks on me only proves that the American lovers of violence and the issuers of fatwas in OUR society haven't gone away. They are our American Isis - ""Criticize or mock those whom we deify, like our sainted sniper, and we will harm you most assuredly.""",,status,,2015-01-29 18:53:12,23231,6714,4148,23231,0,0,0,0,0
24674986856_10152568343941857,"""My 12 Years of Support for the Troops ""

Before I post my more general thoughts later today or tomorrow about the ruckus of the past week regarding the response to my heartfelt comment on twitter about my uncle who was killed in World War II by a sniper - and how I was taught to despise snipers of any stripe - I would like to address this one insane mantra that the right-wing has twisted my tweet into: ""Michael Moore hates the troops.""

Well, who would know better about hating our troops than those who supported sending them into a senseless war Iraq in the first place?

And, for 4,482 of them, a senseless, unnecessary and regrettable death. 

If you supported that invasion, if you voted for George W. Bush and the Republicans and Democrats who backed this war, then you are the ones who have some 'splainin' to do. Not me. You. 

Because only ""haters"" of our brave young men and women would recklessly send them into harm's way for something that had absolutely nothing to do with defending the United States of America. Nothing. Nothing to do with 9/11. Nothing. In fact, WE, the USA, were the ones who provided Saddam with his weapons in the 1980s that he used against the Kurds. We wanted him to use them against the Iranians, but you hand a crazy guy crazy weapons, something crazy is probably going to happen. Ask Osama bin Laden about that -- what he did with the crazy training, crazy money and crazy weapons that WE gave him. Oh wait. You can't ask him. Because the new president took him out. No 150,000 troop invasion necessary. Just 12 or so Navy SEALS and two and a half choppers.

Here's the truth they can't or won't report: I'M the one who has supported these troops - much more than the bloviators on Fox News. To prove it (and I know this is going to crush some of you out there), here's just a partial list of all the things I do and have done for those men and women who serve -- and I guarantee you, you've never heard any of this reported about what the real me does because, frankly, it messes up their little story of the fictional ""Michael Moore"" they've created for your hate and enjoyment (please feel free to cut, paste and send this to your conservative brother-in-law):

** I have an aggressive  affirmative action policy specifically to hire Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at my film production company, my movie theaters in Michigan and my film festival. I have asked other businesses in my town (and nationwide) to join with me on this. http://www.traverseticker.com/story/michael-moore-asks-businesses-to-hire-a-vet . A vet was an editor on my films ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Sicko"" and a vet (who served in both Iraq AND Afghanistan) is the projectionist at my flagship theater in Michigan (to name a few). 

** I also ask people to post a sign I designed and have made available: ""I Shop Where Vets Work"". Here's my policy and the poster: http://www.statetheatretc.org/veterans#opening  (Can someone at Fox News send me your posted affirmative action program to hire Iraq and Afghanistan vets?)

** Since I opened my movie theaters in northern Michigan, this has been my admission policy: ""Admission to all movies at my theaters is FREE, 365 days of the year, for ALL active duty military and their families.""  

** I allow local veterans support groups to use my theater to meet for PTSD issues, I host quarterly PTSD summits, and I've hosted a conference to start a jobs movement for vets in our town. 

** I have raised tens of thousands of dollars through my website for groups that help veterans and wounded warriors: http://web.archive.org/web/20140829053240/http://fahrenheit911.com/soldiers/

** In the early years of the war I made all my books and DVDs available free of charge to all service members through BooksForSoldiers.com

** I produced and hosted a benefit for military families at the House of Blues that received national attention to their plight (raw clips here from the AP: https://vimeo.com/117687290 )

** I will NOT do business with vendors who don't have a policy to hire vets.

** I gave voice to the troops who weren't being heard by publishing a book of their letters from the front lines in ""Will They Every Trust Us Again?"" (NY Times bestseller for 4 weeks)

** I regularly post blogs from troops http://www.ivaw.org/blog/ivaw-featured-michael-moore  and I show and support many movies about what they've gone through in the past 12 years at my theaters.  

** I took vets, soldiers and their families on a 60-city tour of the country so their concerns could be heard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm3IsgoBNc0

** I helped Iraq Vets against the War with ""Operation Recovery""  http://www.ivaw.org/operation-recovery and http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/how-bout-dinner-just-you_b_791535.html   
** My movie, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" - #1 selling/#1 rental on all military base PXs

** My books were the #1 requested books by troops from the nonprofit BooksForSoldiers.com

** I sit on the Advisory Board of the Pvt. Bradley (Chelsea) Manning Support Network

** From the Dept. of Irony: I only hire Navy SEALS and ex-special forces for when I need security - such as this week, when so-called supporters of those SEALs want me harmed.

** When my father passed away this year, in lieu of flowers I asked that donations by made in my dad's name to the veterans group, Veterans for Peace. Enough money was raised so that the Vietnam Vets chapter could build a home in Vietnam for a family still suffering from the effects of Agent Orange. It's being dedicated in my dad's name.  

** I am currently showing ""American Sniper"" at my theater that I helped restore and that I program and help run in Manistee, MI. Not because I like it, but because, unlike the other side, I'm not a censor. I trust smart people and people of good heart will know what to do. You can't have a conversation about what Clint Eastwood is up to if you haven't seen what it is he's up to. And regardless where u are on the political spectrum, you'll see that every character in Clint's film comes out dead or permanently damaged. This ain't no John Wayne rah-rah pablum. Eastwood made maybe the greatest western ever - ""Unforgiven"" - but now it's sad seeing him talking to an empty chair on a stage or making an Iraq movie that Rolling Stone this week called, ""too dumb to bother criticizing.""

In the end, the thing I'm most proud of for what I've done for the troops was sticking my neck out 12 years ago to become a leading opponent to Bush and the war. I tried to save more lives than a sniper ever could hope to -- by preventing us from going to war in the first place. Well, I failed at that. But I've done everything else humanly possible to try and make it up to those troops when they return home -- that is, the ones lucky enough to return home. 

So, Fox News and the other lazy media -- quit making shit up about me! You look ridiculous. If you want to have a debate with me about the ISSUES and the POLICIES, then let's have it. If you want to debate a movie that's trying to rewrite history, then let's have that. But when you hide behind falsehoods and then use them to try and manipulate the public, then all you are is afraid. Afraid of me, an unarmed American, and the truth I bring along as my sidekick.

If they wanted to know my opinion of ""American Sniper"" (and I have one), why not ask me?

So here's what I think about ""American Sniper"":

Awesome performance from Bradley Cooper. One of the best of the year. Great editing. Costumes, hair, makeup superb!

Oh... and too bad Clint gets Vietnam and Iraq confused in his storytelling. And that he has his characters calling Iraqis ""savages"" throughout the film. But there is also anti-war sentiment expressed in the movie. And there's a touching ending as the main character is remembered after being gunned down by a fellow American vet with PTSD who was given a gun at a gun range back home in Texas -- and then used it to kill the man who called himself the 'America Sniper'.

Also, best movie trailer and TV ads of the year. 

Most of us were taught the story of Jesse James and that the scoundrel wasn't James (who was a criminal who killed people) but rather the sniper who shot him in the back. I think most Americans don't think snipers are heroes. 

Hopefully not on this weekend when we remember that man in Memphis, Tennessee, who was killed by a sniper's bullet.","Michael Moore Blasts 'American Sniper' Hero: Gunmen Are ""Cowards""",link,http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-moore-blasts-american-sniper-764623?facebook_20150118,2015-01-18 22:14:38,24923,24377,5301,24923,0,0,0,0,0

For those of u who aren't -- how 'bout we start again right now? All it takes is a pair of shoes! Remember how it works? Just one 30-minute walk a day. That's it. Then, if u want, post your thoughts and pix from the walk to @mmflint or #IWalkWithMike 

For more info on my walks, here's modified version of a previous Facebook post:

A while back, I had a simple idea: What if all one-and-a-quarter-million of us on my Facebook page (or the nearly two million of us on my Twitter) -- what if we all went for a 30-minute walk together, wherever we are, every single day? Some people asked, ""Why are we walking?"" ""What's the cause?"" There is no cause -- other than we're going for a walk. We do it just because it feels good. We do it because we can. We do it because it's free and it takes no time. All any of us needs to know is how to put one foot in front of the other (or, for the disabled who've joined in, by any means necessary). It's the perfect slacker/schlub activity.

I am often asked ""How much weight have you lost from all this walking?"" For a while I didn't understand the question. I lose socks, I lose keys, I lose my mind. I mean, why would I want to lose anything else? Then I got it -- skinny people (less than 1/3 of the country) want us, the majority (the 66% who are ""overweight""), to be like them. That's so nice of them. 

But the truth is, what they call ""exercise"" does not work for the majority of us (isn't that obvious). Diets do not work. Feeling crummy does not work. Nothing works. My advice: Quit trying to be something you're not, be happy with the life you've been given, and just go for a pleasant walk outside. With me, if you'd like. Wherever you are. Get off the treadmill, stop drinking diet Coke, throw out all the rules. It's all a scam and it conspires to keep you miserable. If it says ""low-fat"" or ""sugar-free"" or ""Just 100 Calories!"", throw it out. Remember, one of the main tenets of capitalism is to have the average person (""the consumer"") filled with fear, insecurity, envy and unhappiness so that he/she can spend-spend-spend their way out of it and, dammit, just feel better for a little while. 

But we don't, do we? The path to happiness -- and deep down, we all know this -- is created by love, by being kind to oneself and others, sharing a sense of community with others, becoming a participant instead of a spectator, and being in motion. Moving. Moving around all day. Lifting things, even if it's yourself. Going for a walk every day will change your thinking and have a ripple effect. You'll find yourself only eating when you're truly hungry. And if you're not hungry, go clean your room, or have sex, or call a friend on the phone. Without realizing it, you'll starting eating like the French (there is no French word for ""fast-food"") -- and you will feel better. You do not feel better admonishing yourself or beating yourself up or setting up a bunch of unrealistic rules and goals with all the do's and dont's that are just begging to be broken. You wanna know something? I eat ice cream every friggin' day. I drink a regular Coke every single day. I put butter on things. But I also walk every day. Some days now, I walk twice. And now I've started to do some push-ups and lifting stuff. It's building muscle, and in doing so, has created an extra furnace to burn stuff and create energy. Weird! That, in turn, will make you want to sleep 7-8 hours a night -- which is another game-changer. And all the walking and lifting makes me thirsty, so that makes me drink more water -- another huge plus! The point is, it will happen naturally, not because of a ""resolution"" but because when you walk, your subconscious will crave these things.   

I have no idea how much weight I've lost and I don't care. I don't care about that or diets or home gym equipment or rules about what I can or cannot eat or anything other than making sure I go on my walk today. That's it. That's the big secret. It costs nothing. I feel great. I can see my feet! There they are! Hello, feet! Wanna go for a walk? The feet say YES! Ask yours right now. And if you want, join me. But do NOT go on that walk with me if you are doing so to ""get fit"", ""be healthy"", or ""lose weight"". You are fine just the way you are. Only walk outside with me right now because you know it might just feel good, because it's a beautiful day, or because someone is joining in with you, the fresh air is invigorating, you have to drive down to the drug store but you realize you can walk there, or simply because it's just nice to be alive for one more day. Walk to walk and nothing else -- and the other stuff will take care of itself.

I'm heading outside right now. Join me. And let me know how it went! #IWalkWithMike @mmflint",,status,,2015-01-01 21:06:25,8065,824,1309,8065,0,0,0,0,0
