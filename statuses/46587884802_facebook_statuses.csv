A few high-level women are ""leaning in"" to chisel cracks in the glass ceilings of corporations and government. But what are the other 99 percent's prospects in our economy and law?

Please join Demos, The New Press and ColorOfChange.org for a lively discussion about the economic, political, and legal issues bedeviling working women. Caroline Fredrickson and Ari Melber will discuss Fredrickson's much-anticipated new book, Under the Bus: How Working Women Are Being Run Over (The New Press). Farai Chideya will emcee.

America's basic work and safety net protections, which citizens assume are available to everyone, are failing millions of women. Routinely denied a minimum wage, maternity leave, health care, overtime pay, and the right to organize, working women are often thrown under the bus. How can this country confront the systemic mechanisms that trip up working women? How can progressives support exploited women, dismantle economic inequality, and promote racial equity?

Don't miss this vital discussion about the human face of workforce inequality – and about feminist politics moving forward.

Beverages and light refreshments will be served. Free and open to the public. The author will sign books after the program.
