Though she's chiefly known for her radical refusal to move to the back of the bus, setting off the historic 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, her actual work and its impact on the humanity of Black women and girls in the face of overt sexual violence is not widely discussed.

In 1944, Parks organized others in her community to protect and defend Black women and girls against violations of sexual assault in the Jim Crow South. As branch secretary of the Montgomery NAACP, she investigated the acts of rampant sexual violence committed against Black women. For many years, she led local and national coalitions, created national media opportunities, and urged Black women to ""speak out"" in the struggle against sexual violence.

Fast forward to me at 33-a proud wife and mother to a 2- and 4-year old, for whom the sun and moon sets. And I'm pregnant. My husband and I chose to terminate the pregnancy because we were already overwhelmed with the difficulties and the joys of parenthood, and the financial strain it causes.

I am now 36. I've had two abortions for very different reasons, and neither have resulted in an ounce of regret, shame, or guilt. I'd make the same decisions again. And, if I were so unfortunate as to not be afforded that right, I'd continue to make my decisions illegally, no matter the risk.

While her photographs show predictable tableaux, they underscore the contradiction between protesters' declarations of Christian compassion and their behaviors: yelling, shaming, and metaphorically bludgeoning people with the Bible.

Kent, of Madison, Wisconsin, travels the country for her ongoing ""Faces of the Fight"" photojournalism project. It's a distinctly different enterprise than other abortion-related photography or visual advocacy, which have tended to focus on rallies, specific political campaigns or measures, or on the stories of women who have had abortions.

""My name is Molly Rampe Thomas. I am the founder of Choice Network, a full service adoption agency located on-site at top abortion clinics nationwide.

Unplanned pregnancy rocks worlds. My agency was built around love for the first woman I ever worked with, who happens to be my daughter's biological mother.

Ro faced an unplanned pregnancy and due to her being HIV positive and struggling from addiction, she was desperate to choose abortion. After working hard to find funding for her very late term abortion, we were both relieved when the day of her termination arrived. Full of peace, she entered the doors.

I was shocked to get her call soon after. She was sobbing. She had just found out her original ultrasound was wrong and she was too far along. She needed now to talk about adoption.

I'll never forget her asking, ""What do I do now? No one will want my baby."" Slowly, but without hesitation, I replied ""I do. What if we do this together? What if we create an adoption plan together?"" 

And together we did just that.

Our adoption story would be the perfect representation of Choice Network, an agency who believes in women and trusts their choices.  Though it is the hardest work I have ever done, I do it for my daughter Gia and her birth mother.

This month Gia turned 5. She is the spark that started my life. She is everything to me. She is why pro-choice matters.""

""I worked at an abortion clinic while I was pregnant with my first child. One of the women who was there to have an abortion asked me if it was difficult emotionally to do the work while carrying a child to term. I told her, ""My feet hurt, my hips hurt, my joints are so lax I have to be careful not to sprain my ankles walking, I have to pee constantly, and I'm looking forward to eighteen years of putting someone else first in my life. You better believe I want you to have a choice about doing this for yourself.

She broke out in a big, relieved smile. One of my best memories.""

My pregnancy was planned to the month. The part you can't plan for is the six months of throwing up and being unable to eat, the multiple emergency room visits for dehydration, the endless rounds of frightening drugs to try to keep nutrients in my body and in the baby's body. The part you can't plan for is the 26 hours of labor, the first big chunk during the biggest storm and power outage in many years. The part you can't plan for is the three hours of pushing so hard the capillaries in my eyes broke. 

Would I do it over again? Absolutely. But NOBODY should have to do it without choosing it. 

I am a parent. I adore my child. And I am completely pro-choice.

""My name is Molly Rampe Thomas. I am the founder of Choice Network, a full service adoption agency located on-site at top abortion clinics nationwide.

Unplanned pregnancy rocks worlds. My agency was built around love for the first woman I ever worked with, who happens to be my daughter's biological mother.

Ro faced an unplanned pregnancy and due to her being HIV positive and struggling from addiction, she was desperate to choose abortion. After working hard to find funding for her very late term abortion, we were both relieved when the day of her termination arrived. Full of peace, she entered the doors.

I was shocked to get her call soon after. She was sobbing. She had just found out her original ultrasound was wrong and she was too far along. She needed now to talk about adoption.

I'll never forget her asking, ""What do I do now? No one will want my baby."" Slowly, but without hesitation, I replied ""I do. What if we do this together? What if we create an adoption plan together?"" And together we did just that.

Our adoption story would be the perfect representation of Choice Network, an agency who believes in women and trusts their choices.  Though it is the hardest work I have ever done, I do it for my daughter Gia and her birth mother.

This month Gia turned 5. She is the spark that started my life. She is everything to me. She is why pro-choice matters.""

Right after my husband and I first moved in together, I got pregnant. We had not been together long, we were not married, had just moved to a new city, only he was working, and the economy had just tanked - not a great time to enter into parenthood. On top of that, I was only 22 and not only wasn't ready then to be a parent, I didn't think I would ever want to be a parent. I was lucky and had access to safe, affordable abortion care.

Fast forward seven years, I got pregnant again. At first I was scared, but I knew in that moment that I was going to be a parent and I was happy about it. That moment reaffirmed my prochoice beliefs; it wasn't just that we were married, stable, ""ready"" to be parents by all outward markers - something had changed inside of me. While I could have probably pulled it together and raised a child all those years earlier, I would not have been able to nurture, love, and provide for my baby in the way that I am now. She turns one year old in a couple of months, and we are hoping to add to our family in the next few years.

Birth control empowered me to choose the right time in my life to have a baby.

After 10+ years on birth control, I stopped taking the pill when my husband and I decided we were ready to start a family. We were elated when we found out I was pregnant. At our 20-week ultrasound, we were devastated to learn that our daughter had a serious combination of heart defects and would need open heart surgery as an infant. But because we were able to wait to have a baby until we were ready and financially stable, we had the means and resources to get our heart baby the critical care she needed.

Our daughter had her surgery at 5 months old and is now doing wonderfully. I'm so grateful that she came into our lives at the right time, when we were able to support her and to cope with this serious and stressful situation.

I'm a pro-choice parent because all women should be able to make the best decisions for their lives and their families.

—Amy

The trade-off for me has been the greatest love of my life! Having my daughter with my supportive and loving partner has been awesome. But I realize now more than ever that no woman should ever be forced to make this sacrifice unless and until she is ready.

This is me at 36 weeks pregnant with my little boy a year ago. Pregnant and pro-choice! And now I am a parent who's pro-choice! I have worked with Planned Parenthood and NARAL in the past to defend abortion rights and have fought against 3 different personhood amendments here in Colorado.

I experienced a miscarriage of a very wanted pregnancy in 2012. I got pregnant less than a year later and gave birth to my son in June 2014–he is a year old as of yesterday! I experienced discrimination during my pregnancy job-wise and while I got justice, it was a difficult situation.

Although physically I had a very easy pregnancy, his birth was difficult and long, and I cannot imagine ever forcing someone to go through any of it. The experience of becoming a mother has only made me more pro-choice. A life-changing event like parenthood should always be a choice. I love my son dearly, and I am glad my husband and I were able to plan when to expand our family!

I had two early miscarriages before giving birth to my son in 1997 and then five more before adopting my daughter in 2004. Although I have always been pro-choice, my struggles with infertility deepened my commitment to speaking out for every woman's right to control her reproductive life. Also, as an adoptive parent, I am grateful that my daughter's first mom was able to choose to continue her pregnancy and was not coerced into doing so by legal constraints. 

Now as a counselor working with women around issues of family building, I am committed to offering pro-choice services for my clients as they struggle with all aspects of fertility, pregnancy and parenting. I trust the woman sitting before me to know her self best and whatever decisions she may make, I am honored to bear witness to them and to support her in them.

This is a picture of me writing to meet deadline with my then 2-year old daughter keeping me company.

— My name is Dawn Friedman and I'm proud to be a pro-choice parent.

I was never sure I wanted to become a mother at all and I made sure my husband knew that before we were married. Choosing to go off of birth control and see if I became pregnant was nerve-wracking, as was being pregnant, but it was also filled with a tremendous amount of conflicting joy.

I am unabashedly smitten by my daughter and would choose her every day of the week, and then some. But the truth is that I value my role as a mother even more because it was my choice to decide.

The right to legal abortion doesn't exist everywhere. A few years ago, a dear friend had an unwanted pregnancy in a country where abortion is illegal. Instead of risking being ostracized by her community and being forced to drop out of university, she had an illegal abortion. In an alley, by an unlicensed physician, putting her own health at risk. Thankfully she survived with no complications, but many women aren't so fortunate. Today she has a family, with children, and a career that fulfills her.

While my friends story might be something that happened in another country, the same thing is happening in America today and quite simply, women's lives are at risk. In Texas, for example, the rates that women are trying to self-abort – yes, self-abort – has skyrocketed because politicians have closed clinics and ignored women.

All of us lead complex lives with different paths, it is not my right to judge what path each woman chooses to take. But thankfully, it is my job to keep fighting for every woman to have the freedom to decide what's best for her.

I will always be grateful for the freedoms that have allowed me to carve the life I lead. And I will continue to fight and organize for those same freedoms for my friend. For my daughter. For every woman. For their right to decide if, when or how to become a mother.

Who's with me?

My grandmother emigrated to America from Sweden. Her husband drove a bakery truck and she was a seamstress and sewed monograms into furs in Boston. They arrived in the late 1920s. They worked hard, but they were poor for a very long time. 

She had an abortion, and I thank God she survived it, but many didn't. Later, when they'd saved and when she and my grandfather could afford a family, she had one child, a son, my father. I am so proud of her for finding the strength to do what worked for her family at a time when that was not easy to do. I too am pro-choice.

Once pregnant, I was ecstatic and overwhelmed. It is imperative that we support women at all stages in their life, when a pregnancy is very desired and when it is not. Women need space to make the best decision for them, without adding undue burden to the process. Being a mother is amazing and rewarding, but challenging; and you need to be ready to take on the challenge.""

I got pregnant when I was 19, single, and in my second semester of college. Anyone who has been there knows how terrifying that is. I found out I was pregnant at a Planned Parenthood after going for a pap smear. 

I will forever be grateful to the nurse who sat down with me as tears streamed down my face and gave me ALL my options without judgment. She provided me with information on local programs for obstetrics care, adoption agencies, and abortion clinics.  

Ultimately, I decided to have my child—a beautiful boy who just turned 10 this weekend (who by the way watched his mom walk for her bachelors and masters degree—education is still attainable while parenting!)  

Parenting was the right choice for me—but the key word is CHOICE. I support a woman's right to choose. Thankfully, we live in a country where we have safe options—making these options illegal would only increase back-alley abortions….we should cherish our woman's health more than that.  Our bodies, our choices.

My daughter and me.  

I am a mother of 4 (3 sons and 1 daughter), and also a women's health nurse. I worked in several Planned Parenthood clinics, in several states, as a clinic and recovery nurse, assisting in abortions and the recovery thereof. I counseled thousands of patients on pregnancy choice. I performed thousands of ultrasound examinations to date pregnancies. I was pregnant with my own babies throughout my career. Never once did a patient seem uncomfortable with or offended by my obvious pregnant belly. I have observed that most women innately understand the concept of ""choice.""  

There are so many reasons women choose parenthood or abortion.  Each one is personal and is really nobody's business other than the woman's and her partner.

In between having my two children (now 16 and 12) I had an abortion. Newly divorced and struggling to make ends meet for myself and my young son, I knew that I was not equipped to provide for TWO children on my own. Plain and simply, my allegiance was to my child, and not to the group of cells within me with the potential to become a child. I had to make sure that my firstborn would be okay, first and foremost. Years later, when I was in a more stable place and able to hold our head above water, I found out I was pregnant again. I felt confident in my ability to add another child to my household and keep everyone afloat, so I excitedly continued the pregnancy. 

My life is amazing now and my children are beyond what I could have ever expected. My son is a junior in high school with his sights set on college in Germany and later, being a published author and a professor of humanities. My daughter is a straight A student, incredibly driven, and on her way to a successful career in ballet and was accepted into the Joffrey Academy. Because I made the choices I did, I have been able to create a strong space for them to grow and receive the support they need to fulfill their potential. 
 
I regret nothing and if I had it to do over, I'd choose exactly the same way knowing what I know now. I support every woman in making her choices and trust her to know what will work best for her.

I am an abortion counselor and have been for 3 years. 7 months ago I gave birth to my first child. 

During my pregnancy I had so many patients and even friends make comments about me being pregnant. ""How ironic to work at an abortion clinic and be pregnant!"" Or ""I don't want the pregnant lady to counsel me."" When I heard these comments, it was hurtful and frustrating, but I took it as an opportunity to educate those around me. 

Being pro-choice is about being able to decide IF and WHEN you want to be a parent. I am choosing at this time in my life to be a parent. There was a time in my life when I decided it wasn't the best time for me to have a child. I'm so glad I had the choice and was trusted to make the best decision for myself and for my future family.

My name is Liz Jones and I am a pro-choice parent. I had my son two and a half years ago and an abortion last year. After dealing with a traumatic birth and the stigma of abortion, I became a doula to help other parents through their difficult transitions. I believe that everyone deserves love, support, and autonomy through the full spectrum of pregnancy experiences.

I am the mother to two boys. Experiencing pregnancy and childbirth twice merely reinforced my belief that each woman must decide for herself if it's a journey she wants to go on.

Pregnancy helped me better understand the 'grey' in these choices, which is why no one else should be able to make them. Because my husband and I were ready and wanting to have children, the moment we knew that I was pregnant, our son was a 'baby.' For others, that wouldn't be the case. I could never presume to tell someone else how to feel in that moment.

Both of my pregnancies were relatively easy from a physical standpoint, but I struggled through both due to having a mental health condition. What I didn't realize before my first pregnancy was that the significant hormonal changes would only worsen the anxiety and panic attacks that I had been managing for many years. I also worried about whether to take anti-depressants during my pregnancies. I ultimately decided not to, but the result was nine months of very challenging mental health during each one. I cherish my kids, but I know that I don't want any more. I don't think being pregnant for a third time would be good for me. I am blessed to have access to birth control and a stable life that has allowed me to stick to that plan. But what if I didn't? Or what if it doesn't in the future?

And pregnancy - with its many discomforts, body changes and ""rules"" - and especially childbirth should never be forced on someone who doesn't want to have the child. It would truly, truly be torture. It's a day in, day out, whole life commitment followed by an excruciating process to deliver the child into this world. It is difficult, uncomfortable and painful for women who are ready, willing and supported. I cannot fathom forcing someone who's not to endure that.

For these reasons and more, experiencing pregnancy made me believe even more deeply that only women, their families and their doctors should decide how to handle a pregnancy. There is no black and white here; there is only grey. No lawmaker should attempt to tell women how to handle that grey.

I was 19 when I got pregnant with boy Maxie. At the time my boyfriend lived out of the city, so I knew I had to evaluate my choices when it came to my pregnancy and being a parent. When I went to Thomas and told him I wanted to have Maxie I also knew it was a decision that could have left me a single, young parent and it was  responsibly I was ready to take on. Luckily I had a boyfriend who packed up and moved in with me, only to now be the best daddy!

Being pregnant and being a parent is a conscious that a women should make on her own. Being pregnant comes with so many possible heath risks, not  mention the mental toll it could take on a woman NOT ready to carry a child. I went through a whole pregnancy with chronic vomiting and preeclampsia.  Being a parent is a 24/7 thing on top of what you have to do for yourself, which can be taxing and mentally straining as well.

I love being a mom, but that doesn't mean every woman feels the same, which is 100% okay! Every lady should have the say so over her own body!

My husband and I experienced three painful miscarriages before our son was born. After the third, we visited a counselor. The grief was too much for us to bear on our own. The counselor made a huge mistake during the session. His office was close to a Marie Stopes Clinic. He told us that every morning when he drove to work and thought about all the families dealing with infertility, he wanted to ""burn [the Marie Stopes clinic] down."" I was shocked and outraged but too emotional with my own grief to manage more than a comment about how his remark was inappropriate. I've thought often since then about what I should have said. My message today is for him. 

I am a mother by choice. I was never certain that I wanted children, but when I met my loving husband, it became clear that parenthood was our path. When it didn't happen easily, we were devastated. I experienced emotional and physical pain, including severe hemorrhaging and emergency hospital visits. Eventually we were fortunate to have the means for and access to IVF. This picture was taken just hours after our son was born. I had an emergency cesarean because I had developed life threatening HELLP syndrome. 

Looking back, I can honestly say that there is not one moment when I would have begrudged another woman the right to choose to end her pregnancy. Some may find that to be a contradiction, but I see it as the most uncomplicated representation of my belief in sexual and reproductive rights. In fact, claiming to be ""pro-life"" and stating that a Marie Stopes Clinic should be ""burned down"" is the real contradiction. — Naomi Lince-Deroche http://rhrc.us/1JdNXbg","Pregnant, Parenting, Pro-Choice",photo,https://www.facebook.com/rewire.news/photos/a.10153560620936738.1073741827.9432926737/10153528429576738/?type=3,2015-08-05 09:04:00,373,5,36,373,0,0,0,0,0

""I have a 3 year old daughter and I'm currently 31 weeks pregnant. I have been pregnant four times, twice after my daughter. One pregnancy ended in abortion because of a serious medical issue where I nearly bled to death at thirteen weeks. I should not need to almost die to be given access to abortion.

This pregnancy has been difficult and painful and my partner and I have made the very conscious decision to terminate the pregnancy if my health or the fetus' health is at serious risk. Hopefully that doesn't happen and hopefully if it does, I can deliver immediately. I need to think about the baby that is already alive and the man I chose to start my family with; I'm not just an incubator for fetuses.

As an indigenous woman, the historical trauma is ever present. Women were forced to undergo serious surgery to stop them from having children or were raped by white men and bore their children by force. On reservations, women are 25% more likely to be raped and considering the only health provider is Indian Health Services, a federally run facility, good luck getting an abortion.

Becoming a mother has made me more pro choice than ever because it effects family dynamics and finances, everything under the sun so if a woman isn't ready for children, who are we to prevent her from developing as a person first to become a good mother later or supporting her choice to never be a parent? My daughter and hopefully son realize how important it is to support mothers and women; it's not only a part of human rights, it's a huge part of our culture and tradition. Women bear a huge responsibility; why not support half the population??""
