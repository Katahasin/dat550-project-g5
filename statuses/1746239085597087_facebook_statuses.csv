Dear  (the site fills it in by state):

I have now spent several weeks, reading the Constitution, the Federalist Papers and SCOTUS cases connected to the role of the electors.The electoral college's function is to select statesmen who rise above petty politics, who  safeguard the enduring interests of the republic. 

Your job is clear --  to rise above petty politics.

Are the requirements made by most states with regard to pledged electors Constitutional? First, there is no mention of pledges or requirements with regard to ""winner take all"" in the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has not ruled on whether pledges or penalties for failure of an elector to vote as pledged may be enforced by the Constitution. No Elector has every been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged.

There is one further role that the founders envisioned for the Electors - to prevent ""the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union?"" (Alexander Hamilton, March 14, 1778 -- Federalist #68).

The CIA has spoken and there is now bi-partisan recognition of the fact that the Russia Leadership has interfered with our Elections.  This issue of whether the vote was manipulated also connects to questions of the relationship between Russia and the Republican candidate, and Russia and members of his inner circle. Trump Russian connections leap at us.  The Republican candidate knew about and supported Russian interference.  Treason is outlined as a punishable offense in the Constitution.

Here are some Russian connections of the Trump circle.  Paul Manafort, then Trump's campaign manager, was forced to resign because he was a paid lobbyist for Russian leaning groups in the Ukraine, Mike Flynn, proposed to head National Security, has close ties to Russia, has appeared on the Kremlin's RT network and has visited with Putin several times in prominent Russian events. In August, in the heart of the Trump's campaign's busiest hours, Ivanka Trump flew to Croatia to visit with Wendy Deng Murdoch (Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife who is now Putin's girlfriend). Now, Rex Tillerson is the head of Exxon, and Trump's choice for Secretary of State. Tillerson has a long-documented relationship with Putin and received the Order of Friendship medal from Putin himself this year."" Friends and associates have said few U.S. citizens are closer to Mr. Putin than Mr. Tillerson,"" the Wall Street Journal reported. Exxon will benefit if the sanctions against Russia are dropped, and drilling resumes in the Russian Artic.

Trump himself has basked in Putin's praise, praised the Russian former KGB operative as ""more of a leader than Obama,"" and supported Russian foreign policy with regard to Syria and NATO. He shocked the world when he urged Russia to hack into Hillary's emails- ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing."" He has further said he would be :looking at ...recognizing Crimea as a ""Russian territory.""

Your job is to rise above politics.  Your job is to stop foreign interference.  Your job is, in short, to stop Trump.

 Had the Russians not interfered, and if FBI chief Comey also acting for the Kremlin and Trump had not interred,  Hillary Clinton who won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes (2,1%) would now be our President, having won the Electoral College too.

It is your job to right a wrong and let freedom ring.  Vote for Hillary.  Serve your role as a defender of Democracy.   We count on you.",Email the Electoral College,link,http://www.asktheelectors.org/,2016-12-13 11:25:31,85,10,252,77,5,1,1,1,0

You wouldn't know it from the media. 

This is what I wrote to the Times. You might want to do this as well.  See instructions below.

To the Public Editor,
The public trusts journalists to report fairly and accurately.  I have found that New York Times journalists are falling short in the disparate coverage of our country's two major party nominees.
I am writing to ask you to review Times articles on the front page about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The coverage is inordinately imbalanced. I believe that when you see the total number of articles about each candidate and the percentage of these totals that are negative articles on each, you will agree that your journalists are falling short of the goal to report fairly and accurately.
For instance, this past Thursday, (both on digital and print) I saw 5 front page articles on Trump, and the only article on Clinton, on the same day, was on page 18.  
On another note, I read this morning that a major economist says that Clinton's economic plan will create 10 million jobs. I would like to think I saw it reported in the Times, but it is more likely I saw the story in The Hill from Twitter. 
I would like to continue to think that the Times is serving the public well, but I have seen clear indications that this is not the case.  I would like the Times to be my reference point for truth and balance, but this is no longer the case.
This is a pivotal election. I would expect the Times to rise to its own highest aspirations. This is not what we've been given.
Sincerely,
Eve Ellis

1746239085597087_1780491042171891,"Why Should a Gay 24 Year Old Care about Nov.8th? by Jeremy Rosenberg

As a millennial, I've seen first hand that politics can be disenchanting, isolating. We crave authenticity. We demand results. We want to be inspired.

This year, it's easy to feel especially discouraged by presidential politics. Republican candidate Donald Trump stands against the values that we have embraced as a generation: inclusion, love and appreciation for our differences, and open-mindedness. His candidacy is deflating and toxifies the political process.

But this year, we also have a candidate who stands for our values: Hillary Clinton. Hillary has fought her whole life to make our country and our world fairer and more just. She believes that our country will be stronger and better off if we continue to harness the strength of our diversity to build a better society. And perhaps, most importantly, Hillary believes in millennials.

She has created a progressive platform that will take on the issues that matter to us: criminal justice reform, ending the student debt crisis, good-paying jobs, taking on the big gun lobby, among so many other issues. She's for us, and that's why this year, it's so critical that we're with her.

Hillary is authentic.

I first met Hillary this year, by surprise, while phone banking at the LGBT Center in Manhattan's West Village. A number of LGBTQ volunteers were making phone calls to voters for New York's upcoming Democratic primThe Gay Community has long supported Hillary and she, LGBT rights. This ad is from 2015.

This is a candidate who cares authentically about us and this is someone who will take our stories with her to the White House.

Hillary gets results.

When Hillary's call for health care reform in 1993 was met with defeat, she did not give up on the fight. Instead, she got to work, because she knew that giving up was not an option. From strengthening the Children's Health Insurance Program to co-writing a law requiring pharmaceuticals to conduct rigorous pediatric trials for children's drugs, Hillary worked hard in the Senate to create concrete solutions for real problems that millions of Americans face across the country. As secretary of state, Hillary bridged the equality gap at the Department of State, ensuring that LGBT employees finally received the equal rights and benefits already received by their counterparts.

In the spirit of LGBT equality, Hillary declared in 2011 that ""gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights"" in recognition of International Human Rights Day. The whole world was watching, and Hillary made sure that the international community was aware that she was firmly on the side of LGBT people across the globe.ary. I was in the middle of a conversation with voters, and who walks in the room? Hillary. She met each and every volunteer. When it was my turn to shake her hand and take a picture, I told her that I was a law student.

Hillary wanted to know more. She asked what year I was in law school, and why I wanted to go to law school. She gave me advice, telling me to continue pursuing public interest law, and reminded me not to give up when I inevitably hit roadblocks in the pursuit of justice. Hillary took the time to listen to people and ask them questions about their lives.

The changes Hillary made as Secretary of State for LGBT people were world-wide and ground-breaking. Her speech on the subject in Geneva changed the world.

These are just few examples of the ways in which Hillary has focused on an issue and fought tirelessly to ensure that something real was done to make it better.

Hillary is inspiring. From the very beginning of her career, Hillary used her law school experience to fight discrimination against people because of their race or disability. During law school, Hillary conducted research about the health care and education of migrant farm workers and their children, inspiring her to focus on the rights of children who are economically disadvantaged. After law school, Hillary went to work for the Children's Defense Fund and fought for families of children with disabilities in order to help pass legislation requiring better delivery of quality education services for these children.

Similarly, Tim Kaine's career began fighting for people facing discrimination. Having graduated from Ivy League law schools, they could have pursued high-powered clients and high-powered paychecks. Instead, they pursued justice. We have the chance to vote in a couple of badass lawyers into the White House this November. Our generation has the chance to define the future of our country. Nothing short of our destiny is at stake in this election.

For these reasons, and so many others, I'm with Hillary and I hope that you are too. I hope that you'll join me in phone banking, knocking on doors, and rocking Hillary swag whenever you can (I may have worn my ""Yaaas, Hillary!"" shirt to a bar last week...).

Let's elect the first ever woman president. Let's ensure that our generation and generations to come have a country that we can all be proud of. Let's work together to ensure that Hillary's platform comes to fruition by electing Democrats up and down the ballot. Let's get fired up! Let's get ready to vote!

According to reports from the media and his campaign, Donald J. Trump is racing to Mexico right before his latest speech on immigration. You can't wait for that, we bet. :)

Let's hope he stops off en-route at Trump Tower for those BIGLY tacos before he goes. TRUMP is a man of BIG appetites, so he may get hungry. We wouldn't want him to eat foreign food? It might poison him. Can't be too careful...

1746239085597087_1780122648875397,"The Foundation and Weiner by Theresa Rebeck
    
This is what happened to me this week:

I got sick of watching news on television! I got bored with Donald Trump!

Apparently I'm right on schedule. Everyone else got bored with the Donald as well, and why not. The new Scandal du Jour is the Clinton Foundation. Well, the NEW new Scandal du Jour is Anthony Weiner and his shenanigans, but we will get to that. Right now, let's take a look at that Clinton Foundation.

How dare they raise money and save lives all over planet Earth? And then, how DARE they claim that that is a good thing? Saving 11.5 million lives is nothing, when you compare it to the dastardly effect of two emails that had something wrong in the subject line. Honestly, I cannot for the life figure out what gets people so mad at those emails and seriously I did try.

Okay I admit that while I stopped watching tv news, I continued to follow my FaceBook feed. So I did get to hear Hillary on the phone with Anderson Cooper.

She was sensational as usual: Bright, firm, clear, determined, intelligent, no nonsense. I loved it. Then, after Anderson got of the call, there was a six person panel who truly ripped her to shreds for a. Not talking to the press enough (just after she hung up from a phone call with Anderson!!!); b. being married to a guy whose foundation saved millions of lives in Africa and c. I stopped watching because I couldn't believe how weird b. was.

i also saw Andrea Mitchell light into a Clinton communications guy about that foundation. He did a good job defending it, and pointed out that if people don't want Hillary to be associated with something that does so much good for people who are really in trouble, that they shouldn't vote for her. He was utterly unapologetic in a way that I liked, and I thought Andrea looked pretty shabby by comparison.

I also saw, on the same FaceBook feed, that old Ragin' Cajun James Carville announce that the press was going to take down the foundation and as a consequence a lot of people are going to die. And then my secret crush Paul Begala got out there and also defended the idea that helping dying people in Africa is a GOOD thing. He was also unapologetic and brilliant and the whole thing made me feel a little better because it at least attempted to push back the true weirdness of the mainstream media's conviction that no matter how much good they do, those Clintons are secretly up to no good.

I didn't have time to watch tv this week anyway: I was invited to visit a friend in the Hamptons. She introduced me to a bunch of people who were nice and interesting and who are, unlike me, still watching the news. Like me, they think the current state of American politics is terrible. I heard plenty about it. They have a lot of money, and they don't like Trump, and they're not going to vote for him. They didn't like Hillary either. The latest thing they don't like? The Clinton Foundation. 
When I tried to tell them how much good that foundation does, they didn't want to hear it. They didn't want to hear my concerns about how much criticism Hillary's taken for things that have never been proven. They thought I was naive. All of that nastiness about her would not be out there if it weren't true, was their position.

It was like talking to everyone on Anderson Cooper's enraged panel. They didn't want to hear about the 11 million lives saved! Those 11 million people meant nothing compared to the rumor, the innuendo, the secret suspicion that Hillary really is just up to no good. They told me they'll vote for her, but they all wished they could vote for someone else. 

My friend, who I love, secretly admitted to me that like me she loves Hillary and she's excited to vote for her. But we had to talk about it in secret.

I kind of can't believe people are so addicted to the innuendo. Hillary really is a sensational choice for president under any circumstances; as an alternative to Trump she's breath-taking. And she's a WOMAN. Which is a good thing; we could use a woman in the White House. We all know it's long overdue. So why do people need to express, over and over, that they are only voting for her because they ""have"" to?

Why are they so mad about that Foundation that is doing so much good? And who gives a shit about poor Anthony Weiner? i love it that places like Slate stand up and say ""hey wait a minute"" when they try to lower the boom on things like the Clinton Foundation. But no one has yet told me why the mainstream media is so convinced that lies and innuendo and whispers have so much validity. These guys are reporters. Aren't they supposed to report, um, facts?

Why can't I see a panel of people who are as worked up into a lather about Donald Trump's debt, misogyny, racism, and his truly dangerous and deep business ties to the Russians? I have heard about those things but honestly I've never seen a panel of commentators go into a big snit about them. Why can't they work that degree of rage up over the truly dangerous Mr. Trump?

This is what I think: I've heard enough from the MSM about accusations that are never proven. I think: Fair's fair. I think: Report on the good stuff too.

And then maybe I'll start watching again.

By Ted Smyth
    
This really happened to Voices4Hillary co-editor. Really.

Yesterday a man knocked on my door and announced that he was a registered Independent and wanted to talk to me about the election. He asked me what I did for a living, which I thought was a bit forward, but I replied informatively that I was a consultant.

He then give me some literature supporting Republican candidates for the US Senate. I said that he sounded more like a Republican than an Independent.

""Ah"", he replied, ""Hillary has won the Presidency. That's a foregone conclusion. But we need a Republican Senate as a check on her power, which is what the Founding Fathers envisaged under the separation of powers.""

""But did the Founding Fathers vote for the paralysis of government as practiced by Mitch McConnell?"", I asked. ""If we elect Hillary she should have the mandate to pass into law her proposals for a fairer society and good-paying jobs for all Americans. The last thing we need is another do-nothing Republican Senate?""

My ""Independent"" gamely replied, using the latest Republican script, ""We have to prevent Hillary from passing more regulations that will kill jobs and give amnesty to immigrants.""

At this stage, I said I had a phone call to make and thanked him for calling.

BEWARE OF REPUBLICANS IN INDEPENDENT CLOTHES!

#HILLARY2016. #BLUEWAVE2016

###

August 30 2015

Addendum. We can turn the Senate Blue.

We need 4 net seats to turn the Senate Blue. Senatorial Race traditionally are tied to Presidential Candidates Success by State. In other words, when Hillary wins a state, where there is a Senatorial race, the Democratic candidate for Senate is more likely to win. There are currently 6 Senate seats held by Republicans in states where President Obama won twice. We can turn the Senate Blue.

The analysis below is from 538 in June but the facts remain intact.

Arizona

Candidates: Republican Sen. John McCain will likely face Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick
Cook rating: Likely Republican
Rothenberg/Gonzales rating: Republican favored
Chance of Democratic victory: 25 percent

This is the type of race that can sneak up on you. Longtime Republican senator McCain fended off a conservative primary challenge in 2010, and he has never lost a race in Arizona. That should hearten Republicans. McCain, though, has never really confronted a strong Democratic opponent. That's going to change this year.

Before the general election, though, McCain has to deal with issues in his own party — he hasn't gotten rid of his problem on the right. Although McCain will probably get past his main primary challenger, former state Sen. Kelli Ward, the fact that we're even talking about his primary speaks to McCain's vulnerability. He'll have to put up with Ward through the Aug. 30 primary vote.

If he wins, McCain will face off against Kirkpatrick, a Democratic representative in the House. Arizona is a red state, and McCain is an incumbent, so he'll enter the general election with some advantages. But Kirkpatrick is a moderate and has a history of winning in Republican-leaning districts. McCain leads in the polls, but only barely, with a 2 percentage point edge on average.

And then there's Trump, whose presence at the top of the GOP ticket should give us pause. Clinton leads in the average poll out of Arizona at the moment, but there are still a lot of undecided voters who likely lean Republican, and Trump led in the one Arizona poll taken since he wrapped up the nomination. There are reasons to think Trump might underperform in Arizona, namely the state's large Latino population. In 2012, 23 percent of the citizen population was Latino, though just 17 percent of Arizona voters were. We've already seen reports of Latinos registering in high numbers in California this year, so it isn't far-fetched to imagine the same thing happening next door in Arizona. If it does, McCain needs to watch out.

Florida

Candidates: The Democratic and Republican candidates are yet to be decided [current --race seems to be shaping for Patrick Murphy vx. Marco Rubio]
Cook rating: Tossup
Rothenberg/Gonzales rating: Pure tossup
Chance of Democratic victory: 64 percent

The question dominating the Florida Senate race is whether Marco Rubio — who planned not to run for re-election to pursue the White House (that didn't work out) — decides to run after all. If he does, then he'd probably be considered at least a slight favorite against the most likely Democratic nominee, Rep. Patrick Murphy. Rubio led Murphy by 8 percentage points in a recent Associated Industries of Florida survey. Even Rubio, however, wouldn't be a sure thing for Republicans; Obama carried Florida in 2008 and 2012, and Clinton leads Trump in most of the state polling.

If Rubio does not run, then the Republican side of the aisle looks like an absolute mess. The main contenders are Carlos Beruff, Rep. Ron DeSantis, Rep. David Jolly and Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera. The limited primarypolling we have suggests that no one has a clear edge, nor do any of them seem to have any super compelling claims on electability in the general election. We'll know more after the Republican primary Aug. 30.

The Democratic side isn't that much clearer. Arch liberal Rep. Alan Grayson (who endorsed Bernie Sanders) is facing off against moderate Murphy (who endorsed Clinton). Murphy has more money and more backing from elected officials, but you wouldn't know that from the limited primary polling we have so far; the average shows Murphy up by just 2 percentage points. Still, Murphy is probably a slight favorite.

Whoever the Democratic nominee is, I'd expect Florida's Senate general election race to mirror the presidential race. Murphy and Grayson are leading in more polls than not, but their margins are small. The one consistency in the polling: There are a lot of undecideds, who will likely break the way they do in the presidential race.

Illinois

Candidates: Republican Sen. Mark Kirk is facing Democrat Tammy Duckworth
Cook rating: Tossup
Rothenberg/Gonzales rating: Lean Democrat
Chance of Democratic victory: 77 percent

This is one of the two most likely seats to flip this year. Kirk was first elected to the Senate in the 2010 Republican wave. He has the profile of a Republican who can win in Illinois: moderate and from the lakeshore. Kirk's problem is that Illinois is a solidly blue state, especially in a presidential year. No Democratic presidential candidate has won the state by less than 10 percentage points from 1992 through 2012.

Democrats also benefit from having a strong candidate in Duckworth, a House member and Iraq War veteran. Duckworth is about as moderate as Kirk, according to their voting records, and had more cash on hand than Kirk through the first quarter of this year,3 despite Kirk's strong fundraising. She's also less likely to fly off the handle — Kirk has been known to make controversial statements.

Don't sell Kirk short, though: He's won a number of tough races and is a fighter (witness his comeback from a stroke). But at the end of the day, he's fighting Illinois's Democratic lean more than Duckworth. He's trailed in the few polls that have been conducted, including being down 3 percentage points in a survey released by his own campaign. If Kirk holds on in Illinois, it's probably a sign that Republicans are keeping the Senate.

Nevada

Left to Right, Duckworth, Cortez Mastro, McGinty--all possible winners.#BlueWave2016

Candidates: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto will likely face Republican Joe Heck
Cook rating: Tossup
Rothenberg/Gonzales rating: Pure tossup
Chance of Democratic victory: 51 percent

How sweet would it be for Republicans if they could win the Democratic minority leader's seat? Six years ago, many political observers thought just that would happen, but in 2010 then-Majority Leader Harry Reid won re-election by 6 percentage points, despite polls showing him trailing. The unpopular Reid, who is retiring, won because Republicans picked a disaster of a candidate in Sharron Angle.

Angle is running again but will almost certainly be defeated in the Republican primary by Heck, a member of the U.S. House. Heck is about as strong a nominee as Republicans could hope for. He represents a swing district just outside of Las Vegas, the 3rd.

Heck's Democratic opponent is likely to be Masto, a former state attorney general. She's Reid's hand-picked successor and probably one of the best options the Democrats had. Masto, who has Mexican heritage, will be relying on Nevada's growing Hispanic population, which has taken the state from a Republican lean to fairly easy Obama victories in 2008 and 2012. Trump's position at the top of the ticket might hurt Heck; we've already seen Nevada's other Republican senator, Dean Heller, say he might not vote for Trump. Heck has led in the very few surveys of the race released so far, though polling in Nevada has tended to underestimate Democraticcandidates in past elections.

Heller proved in 2012 that a Republican can win a Senate race in Nevada even as a Democrat carries the state at the presidential level. We'll have to wait and see whether Heck can follow in his path.

New Hampshire

Candidates: Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte will likely face Democrat Maggie Hassan
Cook rating: Tossup
Rothenberg/Gonzales rating: Tossup/Tilt Republican
Chance of Democratic victory: 41 percent

New Hampshire could be the rare swing state where, even if Trump is struggling, he doesn't hurt down-ticket Republicans. Trump cruised in the Granite State's Republican primary, while Clinton fell flat there against Sanders. It's also one of only four states where non-Hispanic whites make up more than 90 percent of the population. So Trump's lack of appeal with minority voters won't hurt the Republican brand nearly as much in New Hampshire as in, say, Florida or Nevada.

Ayotte won easily in the Republican wave of 2010, and polls show her to be relatively popular in the state. She's less conservative than most of her Republican colleagues in the Senate, and she has tried to keep her distancefrom Trump by ""support[ing] the nominee"" but not endorsing him. Ayotte also showed she can win a tough race when she fended off a conservative challenge from Ovide Lamontagne in the 2010 Republican Senate primary. She's also led in most of the polls (though by small margins) against the probable Democratic nominee and current New Hampshire governor, Hassan.

Hassan, for her part, is quite popular, with a 52 percent approval rating versus a 33 percent disapproval rating in a recent University of New Hampshire survey. She survived the Republican wave in 2014 by a small but comfortable 5 percentage point margin. But making the jump from popular governor to senator isn't always easy against a good opponent.

Still, I shouldn't oversell Ayotte's advantage over Hassan. Although the early polling shows Ayotte doing a few percentage points better than Trump, who is trailing Clinton in the state, a rising tide tends to lift all boats. Just ask New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who beat John Sununu in 2008 by a little more than 6 percentage points when Obama beat McCain by a little less than 10 percentage points in the state. If Clinton wins New Hampshire by more than a few points, she'll likely take Hassan with her.

Ohio

Candidates: Republican Sen. Rob Portman is facing Democrat Ted Strickland
Cook rating: Tossup
Rothenberg/Gonzales rating: Tossup/Tilt Republican
Chance of Democratic victory: 46 percent

I guess it shouldn't be too surprising that control over a branch of the federal government may come down to the state of Ohio. Portman, like Ayotte in New Hampshire, cruised into office in 2010 as part of the Republican wave. He's been known in the state for some time as a former representative from the Cincinnati area and a former member of President George W. Bush's administration. Portman comes from the moderatebusiness wing of the party, the ""Chamber of Commerce wing,"" and it shows in his fundraising. He has more cash on hand than any other Republican member of Congress running in 2016.

Portman, though, won't have as easy a ride as he had in 2010. He's facing off against Strickland, a former governor who almost won re-election in 2010despite super strong headwinds and a strong challenger, John Kasich. Strickland lost by just 2 percentage points as Portman was winning his Senate seat by 17 points.

The Ohio Senate race is in some ways the opposite of the presidential race: Both Trump and Clinton have historically bad net favorability ratings; Strickland and Portman both have positive net favorability ratings, 6 and 13 percentage points in the most recent Quinnipiac University poll, respectively.

So far, Portman has held a 0.3 percentage point lead in the average poll, but Strickland has also led in a number of surveys. The fact that Portman holds even a tiny edge when Clinton is leading in the vast majority of Ohio pollssuggests that he could win even if Clinton carries the state. But as in New Hampshire with Ayotte, Portman probably will be in deep trouble if Clinton wins the state by more than 5 percentage points.

One thing to watch for is the regional bases for each candidate. Portman may do better in the Cincinnati area than Trump, while Strickland may do better in southern Ohio than Clinton. It'll be interesting to see if these bases hold in a presidential year.

Pennsylvania

Candidates: Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is facing Democrat Katie McGinty
Cook rating: Tossup
Rothenberg/Gonzales rating: Tossup/Tilt Republican
Chance of Democratic victory: 18 percent (or 46 percent)

What's the deal with the two probabilities for this seat? If you look at all polls taken in the first half of this year, Democrats have an 18 percent chance of winning. If you look only at the one poll taken since McGinty won the Democratic nomination in late April, they have a 46 percent chance. In a victory for the party machine, McGinty was able to sneak past 2010 Democratic nominee Joe Sestak. (She was endorsed by Obama.) Hard-fought primaries, as Clinton and Sanders have demonstrated in the presidential race, can keep a candidate's numbers down.

That Toomey has led in every single poll is likely a testament to his skill as a politician. He's one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate and represents a state that hasn't voted for the Republican in a presidential election since George H.W. Bush won there in 1988. Toomey had a +15 percentage point net approval rating in the most recent Quinnipiac University poll. He also has a cash-on-hand advantage over McGinty of more than $8 million.

For McGinty to win, the formula is simple. First, she must hold on to her post-nomination polling bounce. Second, Clinton has to keep her advantage over Trump in the presidential election (she hasn't trailed in a single statewide poll of Pennsylvania this year), and her voters have to also pull the lever for McGinty. If Pennsylvania votes for the Republican presidential candidate in larger numbers in 2016 than it has in the past, as FiveThirtyEight contributor David Wasserman argues it might, that would be good news for Toomey. Keep in mind, though, that Toomey won by only 2 percentage points in the 2010 Republican wave — that tells you winning re-election won't be easy for him.

Wisconsin

Candidates: Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is facing Democrat Russ Feingold
Cook rating: Tossup
Rothenberg/Gonzales rating: Pure tossup
Chance of Democratic victory: 85 percent

I was surprised that our simple model made Johnson such a long shot. Then I looked at the polling data. Johnson has trailed his Democratic opponent, former Sen. Feingold, in every single poll taken in this race. The closest Johnson has come to Feingold this year is 3 percentage points, in a Marquette University survey from March. All other polls have had Johnson down by more; the most recent St. Norbert College poll had Feingold up 10 percentage points.

This race is a rematch. Feingold held the seat before Johnson defeated him in 2010. Despite being out of the game for six years, Feingold has more cash on hand than Johnson, which is notable because incumbents typically dominate the money race. Feingold probably fits the state's ideology better than Johnson, who is very conservative. Wisconsin hasn't voted for a Republican for president since 1984, and Obama twice carried the state fairly easily.

Johnson's best hope is to keep the race local. More Wisconsinites approve of the job he is doing than disapprove. And Trump looks, at this point, to be a big drag on the ticket: He has trailed Clinton by 9 percentage points or more in every presidential poll taken in the state so far. Trump also lost the Wisconsin primary by 13 percentage points — his last defeat of the primary season.

It would be silly to dismiss Johnson's chances out of hand. He's already beaten Feingold once. But the data suggests that Feingold is the favorite.

If there's a wave

Here's an additional seat each party could gain if almost everything goes right (or wrong, depending on your point of view).

Colorado: Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet has to be thanking his lucky stars. Two years after Democratic Sen. Mark Udall lost a re-election bid, Republicans have struggled to field a respectable candidate to take Bennet on. Republican state Rep. Jon Keyser nearly wasn't even allowed on the primary ballot. Bennet is an incumbent with plenty of cash on hand, so he's clearly the favorite. But without any public polling this year and because Colorado is a swing state, I'm not confident in saying this seat is entirely safe. A model based purely on the fundamentals gives Bennet an 86 percent chance of re-election.

North Carolina: Republican Sen. Richard Burr has led in every poll against Democrat Deborah Ross, though he's never led by more than 10 percentage points this year or gotten to 50 percent in a poll. His average lead since Ross captured the Democratic nomination has been just more than 3 percentage points. The model gives Burr an 80 percent chance of being re-elected. Why? He's an incumbent who is leading in the polls, and North Carolina leans slightly to the right on the presidential level. Ross's best chance is if Clinton wins North Carolina. Polls released since Trump became the presumptive nominee have Clinton a few percentage points behind.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/Voices4Hillary/photos/a.1746239832263679.1073741827.1746239085597087/1780107432210252/?type=3,2016-08-30 14:55:12,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Neither of those two parties has a snowball's chance in hell of winning this Presidential election. In fact, they won't even poll high enough (15%) to participate in the Presidential Debates.

But wait, you say, Rome wasn't built in a day and you've got to start somewhere. No argument there.

How about you start by building a base, you know, go out and talk to your neighbors and create local groups who put forward candidates in local races who get elected and then prove their value by actually delivering real results. In other words, a movement which competes in the real world and has a comprehensive ideology that differentiates them from others and a track record of legislative accomplishment based on that ideology. I know, that takes a long time and a lot of effort and it doesn't just happen every four years.

But your revolution isn't that far away and you could actually have it this election. 

I am talking, of course, about the Supreme Court.

Why We Must Reverse the Attack on Our Democracy from Citizens United through a Constitutional Amendment

by Liz Krueger,  New York State Senate, 28th District

Just across from Liberty Hall in Philadelphia, site of this year's Democratic National Convention, is a small museum housing the famous Liberty Bell. For a century the bell summoned local citizens to participate in the grassroots democracy that forms the foundation of our American ideal. But in the 1840s, after years of hard use, the bell received too hard a blow - it cracked, and no longer able to ring, it fell silent.
 
Six years ago our contemporary democracy received such a blow, one that threatens to silence the voices of the kind of ordinary citizens who responded to the Liberty Bell. In 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled in the now-infamous Citizens United decision that corporations have the same First Amendment rights to political speech as people, and that money constitutes a form of that speech. Citizens United toppled dozens of state and federal laws and decades of judicial precedent regulating spending in political campaigns, and led to the breakdown of barriers to unlimited independent expenditures from individuals as well. This was followed by a disastrous decision in McCutcheon v. FEC, which invalidated aggregate federal contribution limits, again swelling the undue influence of money in elections.
 
Fortunately Hillary Clinton, our Democratic presidential nominee, recognizes the dire effects of Citizens United, and the crisis it has caused in our electoral system. She has said that in her first 30 days in office, she will propose a Constitutional amendment that would allow Americans to establish common-sense rules to protect against the influence of billionaires and special interests, and restore the role of average voters in elections. Her leadership on this issue is vital, because the evidence from across the country is clear – the crack in our Liberty Bell has already formed, and we must repair it soon or risk silencing our democracy for good.
 
The effects of Citizens United are being felt in federal, state, and local elections across the country. In my own state of New York,  a federal district judge, bound by the Supreme Court's decision, struck down a state law that limited contributions to ""Super PACs,"" superseding New Yorkers' rights to regulate our own elections.
 
Rulings like this have already corrupted our election process, and secret money is pouring in at every level. The barriers to entry into the political process have been raised as costs have been driven up, and facts have been distorted beyond recognition. In the 2012 federal elections in New York, spending by out-of-state organizations was 15 times higher than the amount spent in 2008. 170 donors -- just 1/10th of 1% of the population -- gave more than half of all the money contributed to state candidates in 2013.  This trend will surely result in our elections going to the highest bidders and to candidates most favored by an infinitesimal elite of election buyers.
 
New York City has one of the strongest small donor public matching campaign finance laws in the country. But post Citizens United, a small group of real estate executives and corporate bigwigs created a ""Super PAC"" that spent nearly $10 million to make sure the City Council elected in 2013 was ""friendly to real estate and development."" Given the City's strict rules for candidates, the sums the PAC raised and spent were radically greater than the amount the Council candidates could raise themselves. At the time Susan Lerner, Executive Director of Common Cause NY, indicated that the multimillion dollar effort was a significant shift in city politics that ""undercuts the neighborhood-based nature of a district and replaces neighborhood concerns with industry concerns.""
 
Last year the biggest lobbying spender in New York State put over $5 million into a campaign to create a nearly 100% tax break for donations to private and charter schools, which would starve the state of revenue that could otherwise be used for public education. A recently created ""Super PAC"" in support of this effort raised over $2 million in its first few months of operations from a handful of  financial executives. Campaigns like this, to funnel money out of public schools and into the pockets of hedge-fund billionaires, can only succeed because the voices of regular Americans are shouted down by the beneficiaries of Citizens United.
 
The people of New York and all other states must be afforded the power to limit money in our politics. Hillary Clinton's proposed Constitutional amendment would establish that artificial entities created by law are not entitled to the same rights and protections under the Constitution as natural persons. It also guarantees the power of federal, state, and local governments to limit, regulate, and require full source disclosure of all money spent to influence elections.
 
Every election cycle dominated by the power of big money brings us one step closer to irreparable damage. Artisans in Philadelphia were unable to make the cracked Liberty Bell ring again, but it is not too late to fix our broken democracy. Hillary Clinton understands this. That is why we must send her to the White House, and that is why I'm with her.

A COMPELLING PROPOSAL
Tim Kaine for Hillary VP

By Sarah Kovner

The old adage ""that a vice presidential candidate should do no harm"" speaks to the choice of Senator Tim Kaine, a moderate non-controversial Democrat.  But I see a more compelling case for choosing the Virginia Senator.

We all know, or should, that before he was a Senator, Kaine was the Governor of Virginia and DNC chairman at the same time, and before that he was Mayor of Richmond.

What most people don't know is that after graduating from Harvard Law School he spent 17 years practicing law in Richmond representing people who had been denied housing opportunities because of their race or disability.

What we also don't know is that the Senator took a break from Harvard to work as a Catholic missionary in Honduras where he learned his fluent Spanish. Indeed, when i saw him in Georgia campaigning for Michelle Nunn in 2014, he was specifically meeting with Spanish-speaking Hispanic entrepreneurs and other community groups.

As a prime architect of President Obama's Iran deal in 2015, Senator Kaine demonstrated his ability to work across party lines with Senator Corker while maintaining his principles of diplomacy first.

I have known Tim Kaine personally since 2009 and I want to say that he is committed to progressive values and works to achieve them in a collaborative way. I think we all believe we need more of that in Washington and indeed in the country as a whole. He also has 100% rating from Planned Parenthood and says that ""the right role for government is to let women make their own decision.""

And while i can make a case (different though it may be) for Senators Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren or Cory Booker, when Tim Kaine becomes Vice President, his replacement will be chosen by a Democratic Governor. The same cannot be said of the others at a time when we vitally need a Democratic Senate.

And one last thought.  Almost blue Virginia borders on purple North Carolina which could help bring  the Tar Heel State along.

Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters? (Richard III, V. 4)

THE MORNING AFTER

Day 4 of My Republican Hangover

I'm not hung-over this morning—I have been wide awake—vigilant. I am scouring the internet looking for comfort and reassurance that Donald Trump could never succeed in his bid for the Presidency.

'During the course of his mocking, savage, and cartoonish primary run, Donald Trump had constantly assured the public that he could become Presidential when necessary: 'I can be more presidential than anybody, if I want to be, I can be more presidential than anybody.I've said' this a couple of times, more presidential than anybody other than the great Abe Lincoln. He was very presidential"". (March 9, 2016)

This was the night for Donald Trump to deliver on that assurance. Trump's acceptance of the Republican Party's nomination for President was his opportunity to present himself as a credible and responsible leader, and to go beyond the wild promises and vitriolic rhetoric of the primary campaign.

He failed to deliver.

Not only did Donald Trump fail to assume the attitude of a President, he demonstrated that he doesn't have the slightest notion of what a President does.

In his speech last night, Trump amplified his role of the screeching, fear-mongering, combatant whose opinions are unchecked by fact, but whose themes become familiar truths only through repetition.

On the primary trail, Trump's rallies seemed like live gatherings of a talk radio audience with Trump serving as inciter-in- chief. His bigotry was able to survive because it was labeled ""honesty,"" and because he eschewed ""political correctness."" His campaign persona remained that of an entertainer, and he would often begin a speech as he did Tuesday night: ""Are you having fun?""

Trump understood that his success relied on him not being Presidential:

""I can do it…You know what, I'm like a really smart person… Presidential is easy… I sort of don't like toning it down... If I acted presidential, I guarantee I wouldn't be here"". Donald Trump, April 23 2016

These tactics, however, could not survive the context of a political convention. He had to ""pivot"" as the pundits kept reminding us. Rather than becoming ""presidential,"" however, Trump assumed an alternative form of leadership.

In last night's speech Trump painted the portrait of a world torn by violence and fear. He accused Obama and Hillary Clinton of leaving ""death, destruction, terror and weakness"" in their wake. Yes, we have had painful lone wolf incidents (Sandy Hook, Charleston) and painful killing of black Americans and recently two sets of attacks on police, but we are not living in an era of daily crime. The nation essentially halved its national homicide rate since 1991.

Nevermind. Seeing crime and spreading fear, Trump presented himself as singularly capable of protecting America: ""Nobody knows the system better than me. That's why I alone can fix it.""

The twitter-sphere was quick to label this new role-- ""dictator.""

(Bernie Sanders on Twitter:""Trump: ""I alone can fix this."" Is this guy running for president or dictator? #RNCwithBernie"")

Sanders and many others were accurately describing the role Trump was carving out for himself: ""I am the Law and Order... candidate.""

He had painted a portrait of America that was so dark, dangerous and defeated that it would become necessary to accept unacceptable solutions in order to survive.

Trump's high notes came through loud and clear—we need to build a wall, we need to ban all refugees, we need to do away with restrictive regulations, we need to cut all government programs that are too costly…

Trump promised to do all of these things ""so fast,"" that he hinted at policies unmoored from legislation. Never once did Trump mention Congress—neither the House, nor the Senate. All decisions would come directly from Trump's authority.

It didn't seem to matter that Trump's claims did not square with the facts. The internet was crowded with live fact-checks as the speech proceeded. Many of Trump's claims regarding crime statistics, immigration policies, the national debt, etc. proved either false or misleading. I did a few above myself.

Relative to Hillary Clinton's e-mails, Trump acknowledged that his own imagination would override the F.B.I's actual findings: ""I also know these terms are minor compared to what she actually did…terrible, terrible crimes—egregious crimes.""

Trump's speech insisted on the principle of ""law and order"" throughout. Was he unaware that this was the coded language used in the 1968 election? Either Trump is ahistorical, which is a problem; or he is deliberately invoking the racism and bigotry of the term's original meaning, which is a different problem.

Trump's speech remarkably seemed to exist in the historical vacuum of his own autobiography. He did not refer to any other Presidents, nor to any precedents in American history. In spite of last night's theme, ""Make America One Again"", Trump did not invite the voters to join him, nor did he invite other Republicans to win together in November.

Trump failed to be presidential last night—and I suspect we would resist calling him a dictator. Then who was he?

I would suggest that Trump's hate-filled speech established him as a villain in American politics.

Trump's language throughout the campaign most closely resembles that of Shakespeare's ultimate villain, Richard III. Both characters are dissembling, unrepentant, monstrously arbitrary, and violent. Richard, once having achieved the crown, doesn't really know what to do with it—nor does he know how to lead.

Before his final battle, Richard addresses his troops by delivering a speech in which he creates a portrait of the enemy that is meant to instill fear in his followers:

What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
Remember whom you are to cope withal;
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
They would restrain the one, distain the other…
Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters? (Richard III, V. 4)

For Shakespeare, Richard is not only a villain, but proves to be a bad leader. This speech of Richard's is proof that he should not remain in authority.

Let's hope American voters come to the same conclusion about Trump.

1746239085597087_1765441860343476,"As we eagerly anticipate the DNC conference next week, Dennis Sullivan, former Editor of MSNBC, reminds us that Hillary will continue to tell the truth, while Trump will continue to lie.

WHO DO YOU TRUST?

Of more than 50 statements made by Donald Trump during his madcap run for the American presidency, 63% of those analyzed by The Washington Post, have been given Four Pinocchios. That means the most lying marionettes the paper can award. The other famous truth checking outfit, Politifact, gives Dissembling Don almost 80% for his mostly false statements, 20% of them getting the rarely assigned rank of Pants on Fire. 

Of course there are things about Dangerous Don that are far more worrying than the obvious fact that he makes things up. But what worries me about his lying is that the media feels compelled to call Hillary dishonest every chance it gets, just to keep things even. Paul Krugman calls it ""twosidedness,"" which I find a felicitous term. It's an old standby of straight journalism of the kind I studied at Columbia Journalism School years ago. Actually it's a perversion of the ancient ideal of objectivity, warped into a wrongheaded notion that's been cleverly exploited by the disgraced Roger Ailes at Fox News Channel. ""Fair and Balanced"" may have become a punch line, but the original nostrum has also become poisonous. 

I think this false balance, more than any set of actual facts, accounts for the endless repetition of the notion that these are the most disliked candidates in the last (pick your number) 40 years. Twosidededness also goes a long way toward explaining the embedded meme that Hillary Clinton is neither honest nor trustworthy despite Trump's verifiable falseness and by now almost legendary and very scarily erratic behavior. After a while, it doesn't seem to matter how loony Trump is, because everyone ""knows"" Hillary is dishonest and untrustworthy.

 It's true that she is often defensive, but she certainly has a right to be. (There really is a vast Right Wing conspiracy after all. ) And besides, has there ever been a politician who was NOT defensive? What about Himself, The Donald? He lash-tweets at every slight and every perceived slight. Not only is Trump untrustworthy, he has proved many times over that he doesn't care about trust. And by the way, the Trump Family attempt to portray Dad as Mr Wholesome has not erased from my mind the memory of his hinting that he would screw Ivanka if she weren't his daughter. And to those who say that Trump says horrible things only to be provocative, I say that you are rationalizing. 

Now it's true that HRC gets her fair share of Pinocchios too. A large percentage of those bad marks have to do with her ""damn emails."" Not everything Hillary said about those mails has turned out to be true. But in no way does that mean she was lying. If you listened carefully to James Comey in his testimony before the House Oversight Committee, he said she was careless, that she seemed to be technically inept, that she was somewhat cavalier. But he explicitly concluded that there was no evidence that she lied, and he repeated that in the face of persistent hectoring from the Republican members. 

The Republicans get away with hanging the mendacity label on Hillary largely because the press keeps making this connection every time they mention her name. It happens so many times that every once in a while I'm almost tempted to buy it myself. 

Whitewater, Benghazi, the server, none of it actually amounts to a row of beans. On the other hand, the Wall, the Muslim ban, the suspension of libel laws, these are real threats. And they're a big deal. 

The inestimable Margaret Sullivan (no relation),  formerly Public Editor of the New York Times and now Media Columnist at the Washington Post, took Lesley Stahl to the woodshed for not challenging, on 60 Minutes, Trump's frequent and demonstrably false assertion that he opposed the invasion of Iraq ""from the  beginning."" Sully (Twitter handle,@sullyview) goes on to say: ""As journalists continue reporting on the Great Dissembler, they need to be.. skilled and persistent at what they do. They should not let Trump, or any candidate, get away with lying to citizens."" Even that ""or any candidate"" is a concession to twosidedess, yet as a critique of the willy nilly kid glove treatment of Trumpian outrageousness, it's spot on. 

Unfortunately, most of this stuff is baked into the cake of obfuscation and outright propaganda. So what can Hillary do about this phony albatross around her neck? Well, the most straightforward answer is probably also the best. Tell the truth. Or as I would put it, continue to tell the truth. Then, pick a running mate with a perfect record for honesty. And  call out every single Trumpian prevarication. Be sure you're right. Apologize when necessary, not excessively, always clearly. And although I get why you don't, I think it would be wise to hold the occasional  news conference. 

Clearing this meretricious character issue is probably not essential to winning  but it has taken on a life of its own, and it will continue to grow like Topsy if it's not taken on squarely. Or so I believe. Honestly.

THE MORNING AFTER

Day 3 of My Republican Convention Hangover by Evangeline Morphos

I had decided to play a drinking game last night—I would take a shot at the mention of any real policy issue. Well, I might as well have been in Drytown, Utah. I was dead sober throughout the evening—and yet, I may have the worst hangover of my life this morning.

The television media and even the print media struggle to shoehorn the events of this convention into the political format they are used to covering. But let's make no mistake about it: we are really watching the hostile take-over of the democratic system.

Trump flew into Cleveland yesterday in his own black and gold jet, literally buzzing past an outdoor Ted Cruz rally before it landed. As he emerged from the plane, the musical theme of the movie Air Force One blasted in the background.

Trump later upstaged Cruz once again when his ominous helicopter landed during Cruz' speech on the convention floor, and he entered the arena to menacingly stare down Cruz at the moment he was refusing to give his endorsement.

Trump is living in his own fictional reality that is borrowed in part from blockbuster films and in part from his own delusional egotism.

These moments of the spectacle of power are exactly how fascist leaders take over a country. This is not about the power of the Presidency—this is about Trump's personal authority and will.

His signature colors of black and gold have substituted for the red white and blue of the American flag. When Trump addressed the audience Tuesday night by satellite, his image was preceded by the phallic, soaring shot of the Trump Tower logo. Several months ago when Trump was confronted with the fact that he had tweeted a Mussolini quote he said: ""I know who said it. But what difference does it make whether it's Mussolini or somebody else?""

The insinuating and insidious power of Trump's moment of triumph over the Republican establishment was lost on the media. Trump came and went, like an ominous presence.

For the pundits and commentators, the story was about Ted Cruz' refusal to endorse Donald Trump, and they were thrilled at the little bit of drama that had been injected into an evening that otherwise repeated the same platitudes about American greatness, and the same droning vilifications of Hillary Clinton. So excited were they by the back-room politics of the speech, they failed to comment on the content.

Lest anyone regret Cruz as the road-not- taken, examine his rhetoric last night. Cruz outlined a throwback conservative agenda that in his debate-trained twisted logic equated states' rights with freedom, ""local values"" with diversity, and American sovereignty with an opposition to net neutrality. (Honestly, I thought the idea of states' rights had already been done away with). Cruz' insistence on states' rights indicated why the Republican establishment might reluctantly remain in the thrall of Trump. Many of the Supreme Court's decisions will be about states' rights vs. federal rights.

Here is where Mike Pence comes in—as if on cue. Mike Pence signals to Republican establishment that Trump will leave conservative values in place.

On the surface, Pence was self-effacing, funny and charming. The general consensus of the media was that this was a ""good speech."" As an introduction to the American people, Pence's appearance at the convention might have been reassuring. He spoke about the prosperity and rise in job rates in Indiana over the past four years of his governorship—ignoring completely that this was the national upward trend of Obama's economic recovery.

That's why it was up to the press to tell us who Mike Pence is, and what he stands for. Instead, the reporters were busy tracking down irrelevant evidence of who had ""booed"" Ted Cruz.

Among other things Pence does not believe in are a woman's right to choose. He does believe that ""smoking doesn't kill"" because only 1 in 3 smokers die of smoking-related illnesses, and he does believe that the animated film Mulan is the product of some ""mischievous liberal at Disney"" and is a subliminal way of entering the debate over women in the military.

Most horrifyingly, Pence signed a law that allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals, which almost put business out of business. Visit Indy — Indianapolis' convention and tourism organization — found that Indiana lost at least $60 million in revenue after lawmakers there passed the so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act,

The reality is that Mark Pence precisely mirrors the appalling platform that was adopted at this year's Republican convention. By now, you may know that the RNC platform calls for the end of Roe v. Wade and the overturn of the right of all to citizens to marry. But did you know that the platform demands that lawmakers use religion as a guide when legislating, stipulating ""that man-made law must be consistent with God-given, natural rights."" Did you know that Pornography is the top problem facing America? I digress….

At the same time that Pence was accepting the nomination for the Vice-Presidency, two shocking pieces of news were revealed.

The first was an insight into how Trump imagined the Presidency. According to a New York Times reporter, when Kasich was approached about being the vice presidential nominee, Trump Jr. said that as vice president he would have power over all ""domestic and foreign policy."" When asked what Trump's role would be, Trump Jr responded: ""Making America great again.""

What does this mean? Is Trump going to yield power? Is he just a big-picture kinda guy?
No—this is a warning signal that Trump does not understand the checks and balances of the constitution; nor does he understand the role of the presidency relative to the three equal branches of government.
The second disturbing piece of news is that Trump signaled that he would unilaterally disturb the United States relationship to NATO. Now, this is from a man who failed to make the distinction between his ass and Brexit the morning after England voted to withdraw from the EU.

Yesterday's events in the arena and outside of it made clear that Trump has no intention of being a traditional President. In fact, he has no intention of being a constitutional president.

A group of historians, including David Nasaw and William Luchtenberg, have gone on line, sending up flares that Trump's presidential bid is dangerously unique in American politics. Last summer Alan Brinkley wrote in Politico: ""It is amazing that a candidate for president has no discernable policy nor any belief system other than the certainty that anything he says is right. Trump is not seeking votes, he is simply demanding attention.""

Trump's deviation from the traditional should not be viewed as merely ""unconventional."" The press needs to vet him for the office he is running for, and the electorate needs to be vigilant about protecting our democracy.

THE MORNING AFTER
Day 2 of My Republican Hangover
 
Well, it looks as if I wasn't the only one yesterday who woke up with a hangover. While, staffers and some interns at the convention were struggling with actual vomiting caused by a spread of the norovirus, the entire Republican establishment and the news media had to put on their rumpled clothes from the night before and assess the damage.
 
Pundits from MSNBC and CNN (and I'm looking at you, David Axelrod) scrambled to walk back their initial glowing praise of Melania's speech in light of the clear evidence that she had cribbed a substantial part of it from Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic convention appearance.
 
Social media was flooded with wickedly funny memes and comments.  What a relief! Most commentators (and Democrats) had restrained themselves from labeling Melania a ""bimbo."" But—the plagiarism controversy—too luscious to ignore--could be configured as an academic question of intellectual honesty and proper citation. 
 
The Trump camp, for its part, sputtered to respond. Campaign manager, Paul Manafort first blamed Hillary Clinton for the mess.  By the end of the afternoon, an exhausted campaign collapsed into citing ""My Little Pony"" as a defense.  Sean Spicer told CNN: ""Twilight Sparkle from 'My Little Pony' said, 'This is your dream. Anything you can do in your dreams you can do now."" (Please—just Google it: ""my little pony spicer""). 

Trump and Melania had fled Cleveland for New York, leaving a meeting with fat cat donors in the lurch.
 
The plagiarism controversy must have been a welcome distraction for the media. Otherwise, commentators would have had to confront the overt ugliness of the previous night's messages. The speakers from the podium Monday night went well beyond ideological issues of the conservative agenda. They spewed messages of racism, xenophobia and the threat of violence.
 
The media and the Republican Party watched helplessly as Trump was nominated Tuesday afternoon.
 
By the time of the roll call—and the official nomination of Donald Trump--television commentators were dangling the tempting possibility of a revolt on the floor. The possibility of a do-over for the Party.
 
Alaska, Washington D.C. and Ohio made some half-hearted attempts to protest the Trump nomination. Gov. John Kasich gave a poignant interview during the roll call and presented a world-that-might-have been view of the proceedings. 

But the nomination process moved inexorably along. A brief spark of interest flared when the Alaska delegation demanded a re-vote in the moments before Trump's nomination was to be officially announced by Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan was left awkwardly roaming the stage for what is an eternity in television time.
 
By now, Republican officials were walking through their paces on the stage. The few Republican Party leaders who appeared, seemed to be guests trapped in a family wedding they never wanted to attend. Reince Priebus, who had notably been drunk during his appearance at the 2012 convention, seemed all too sober last night.
 
This was really supposed to be Trump's night—an opportunity for his family to shine.  He was, after all about to be nominated for the Presidency of the United States, a day —as he himself said he "" will never, never forget.""
 
The speakers Tuesday night seemed equally vapid or vicious as the ones the night before.
 
Witness after witness came forward to present evidence of Hillary Clinton's criminality. Issues that had already been resolved or that were outright lies were presented a ""fresh evidence"" in the kangaroo court finally presided over by a bloated Chris Christie.  Looking like a Disney cartoon character from the mob scenes in ""Beauty and the Beast,"" he led the crowd in chants of  ""Guilty!""

This is not our Democratic/democratic nation.

Even more bizarre accusations came from the somnambulant Ben Carson who suggested that Hillary Clinton was in league with Lucifer. Carson linked Hillary's influence by Satan to a metaphoric mention of Lucifer in a book written by Saul Alinsky, a Chicago political organizer who had been the subject of Hillary's senior thesis at Wellesley. Thank goodness she hadn't written on Milton. 
 
Interspersing these attacks were glimpses of Donald Trump, the father. His daughter, Tiffany, cited several examples of Trump's close parenting: he always asked after her family when he called, he wrote comments on her report card, and he phoned her once when she was in crisis. 

Never mind that her mother recalled in April raising Tiffany, now 22, largely on her own, ""Her daddy is a good provider with education and such, but as far as time, it was just me.""

Donald Jr. delivered the only political speech of the campaign, exhibiting a rigid conservatism on stage with a nascent version of his father's nastiness off stage.
 
When George W. Bush announced he would be the last Republican President—the Republican Party seemed to be accepting its fate.
 
At least one media outlet seemed to be acutely aware of their complicity in the rise of Donald Trump.  While the Trump family paraded on stage as what my friend Annette calls the ""anti-von Trapps"", the Murdoch family was taking action. The owners of Fox News decided—very deliberately and publicly to ax Roger Ailes.
 
It is remarkable that the Murdochs would fire Ailes at the peak moment of presidential election coverage, and that they would not even allow him a face-saving exit.
 
Ailes had, of course, been the architect of eight years of Obama-bashing and Hillary persecution. Like an overweight Dr. Frankenstein, he kept dead stories alive and created new monsters, like Obama's birth certificate and Benghazi.
 
The so-called feud between Trump and Fox news had brought millions of viewers and hundreds of millions in revenues to Fox News. Donald Trump was Roger Ailes creature. The New York Times estimates to be over 2 billion dollars worth of  television time was what  fueled the Trump candidacy to victory.
 
Perhaps it's guilt over the Murdoch empire's encouragement of the Brexit that caused the Murdoch family to wake up from their own private hangover and say: ""What the hell just happened here.""

As a survivor of the Dem and Republican conventions (and other national events) in '68, I've been having flashback dread re. this year's conventions. For those of us who are busy at work this summer and who are traveling for business, catching even only snatches of the doings in Cleveland has far surpassed those previous examples in unprecedented craziness. My highlights so far:

• General Flynn's Armageddon speech - I watched all of it, fascinated by his impression of Sterling Hayden doing ""General Jack D. Ripper"" in Dr. Strangelove. Great sequel to the original movie.
• Melania Trump's weirdly baroque words delivered with impeccable Slovenian accent in a neo-Frederick's of Hollywood outfit — words which turned out to be the product of others' eloquence (hers? a team? who?)
• General Giuliani's mashup impersonation of Jim Cramer at ""Mad Money"" manic best and Al Pacino's top overacting frothing (pick your movie and role). Someone should check his meds and/or his pacemaker.
• Finally, (and only so far — it's just Wednesday!), Ben Carson invoking Lucifer as Hillary's mentor. Talk about ""the devil in the details"". . .  why did Dr. Carson wait until he had lost in the primaries to announce this far out factoid? Might have done him some good when he was still in the running. 

And then there's the apparent termination (Fox-wise) of Roger Ailes, a man ultimately responsible for much of this media-centric nonsense. No public figure deserves disgrace more. 

I'm remembering when Esquire sent William Burroughs, Jean Genet, and Terry Southern (screenwriter of Dr. Strangelove) to ""cover"" the 1968 Democratic convention. Their truly skewed sensibilities delivered the most  tone-right insights into that mess, which was beyond the comprehension of mere journalistic mortals. (Look it up: http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a4718/political-convention-0808/.  I would risk contact with Lucifer to revive their shades and send their subversive souls into the heart of darkness that is the Republican rantfest by the lake.

I read recently that scientists have discovered 1,300 previously unknown galaxies. Is it possible that some mysterious alien life-force has captured our media and that none of this is actually happening? Would that it were so—it would seem less bizarre, less strange, less uh, alien than what is coming across the airwaves.

Have you noticed that many of the pundits alternate looks between uncontrollable smirks and stunned deer-in-the-headlights deadpans? Houston, we have a very big problem.

THE DAMAGE THEY DO
TRUMP, HIS SUPPORTERS and MEXICO
By Andy Kluger

In English

As the Chairman of the Board of the Mexican Museum, Smithsonian affiliate in San Francisco, a lifelong Democrat who votes independent at times, and a father and grandfather, I find myself very troubled.

I was born in Mexico City and grew up in the ABC community (American, British and Canadian). My parents, born in New York and Chicago, came to Mexico for career advancement in education and publishing. My sisters and I attended the American School and were privileged to receive a top education with terrific Mexican children along with expat kids. My worldview was formed by two cultures, American and Mexican.

Thanks to my parents' cultural life, I was privileged to grow up enjoying the visits of individuals such as Diego Rivera, Luis Bunuel, Eric Fromm and others. I joined in cross-national activities such as Boy Scouts, was part of the group that welcomed President Kennedy to Mexico, and participated in the USA pavilion of the World's Fair in Mexico. The warm relations between our two countries made me proud -- until this last year. 

I have in the last two years traveled to Mexico on museum business many times, and in my many conversations with Mexican counterparts, I find the mood between our two nations deteriorating in frustration.

There are never perfect solutions nor right replies but the angst felt by the population in Mexico about the presidential race is disheartening. The conversation in the expat community, the academic and cultural community and within Mexican families who are aware of the US situation revolves around the question, ""Does not the population in the US understand the importance of a rational, thoughtful, experienced candidate like Hillary far outweigh even the slightest consideration of the consequences of a Trump presidency?""

""Do you Americans realize the dangers posed by a candidate that plays to people's fears as so many despots in Europe and Latin America have done?""

The real concern for those asking the questions also revolves around not just the candidate but the mass of voters supporting a candidacy by Trump.

We need to wake up and emphasize not the greatness of America which we do have, but the need to heal our schism!

In Spanish

Como Presidente del Consejo de ""The Mexican Museum"" afiliado a Smithsonian in San Francisco, demócrata de toda la vida que en ocasiones vota como independiente, además de padre y abuelo, me encuentro en una disyuntiva.

Nací en la Ciudad de México y crecí en la comunidad ABC (Americana, Británica y Canadiense). Mis padres, nacidos en Nueva York y Chicago, vinieron a México para avanzar en sus carreras de educación y publicaciones. Mis hermanas y yo asistimos a la escuela Americana y fuimos privilegiados en obtener educación de primer nivel con compañeros hijos de Mexicanos y de otros ExPats. Mi visión del mundo estaba formado por dos culturas, Estados Unidos y México.

Debido a la vida cultural de mis padres fui privilegiado en crecer disfrutando las visitas de individuos como Diego Rivera, Luis Buñuel, Eric Fromm y otros más. Además participé en actividades extracurriculares como Boy Scouts o ser parte del grupo que dio la bienvenida al Presidente Kennedy a México, el Pabellón de los Estados Unidos en la Feria Mundial de México entre otros. La cálida relación entre nuestros dos países me hizo sentirme orgulloso de ser parte hasta este último año.

He viajado a México durante los últimos dos años por cuestiones del museo con frecuencia, y en muchas de mis conversaciones con mis congéneres mexicanos encuentro que el clima entre nuestras dos naciones se deteriora en frustración.

No existe solución perfecta o respuesta correcta, pero la angustia que siente la población mexicana sobre la carrera a la presidencia de los Estados Unidos es descorazonadora. La comunidad ""Ex-Pat"", las comunidades académica y cultural y las familias que están conscientes de la situación en EEUU ronda sobre la pregunta ""¿Es que acaso la población norteamericana no comprende la importancia que una candidatura racional, considerada y con experiencia como la de Hillary supera por mucho la mínima consideración sobre las consecuencias de una presidencia con Trump?""

""¿Es que los norteamericanos no se percatan de los peligros que representa un candidato que capitaliza sobre el miedo de las personas, como muchos déspotas en Europa y Latinoamérica lo han hecho antes?""

La verdadera preocupación de quienes plantean estas preguntas no es únicamente el candidato: es la masa de votantes que apoya la candidatura de Trump.

Necesitamos despertar y enfatizar no la ""Grandeza de America"" la cual tenemos, pero la necesidad de sanar nuestro cisma.

THE MORNING AFTER
Day 1 of My Republican Hangover
By Evangeline Morphos
 
Like most political junkies, I've binge-watched television coverage of conventions for years, but the opening night of the Republican convention has left me, and the nation with a very bad hangover this morning. Despite the ridiculousness interlude of Melania's ""trumped up"" speech to humanize her husband, the message last night was that the Trump candidacy has hijacked the democratic system. 

Early in the afternoon on Monday chaos erupted in the Convention Hall as several delegates, part of a ""Stop Trump"" movement, pushed for a roll call on the convention rules. But the protest was quickly bullied down by the presiding officials, leaving the Republican Party with no way out of nominating Donald Trump as its candidate for the Presidency. 
 
The end of the protest was also the end of any mention of the word ""Republican Party"" throughout the entire evening. This is no longer the Republican convention—it is entirely Donald Trump's.  Not a single speaker used the RP word at any point. The Republican Party seemed to have dissolved into the branding strategy of Donald Trump's singular ambition.  
 
Traditionally, speakers on the kick-off night of the convention are political luminaries who energize the crowd and set the tone for down-ticket victories.  Last night the only ""show"" in a long list of ""no-shows"" was a corpsed-looking Bob Dole who looked sorely in need of one of those little blue pills he once promoted on television.
 
Monday night's roster was more like the list of guest stars for a re-boot of ""The Love Boat"" than speakers at a political convention--Has-beens and D-list celebrities like Scott Baio (whose last executive position was ""Charles in Charge""), one of the guys from ""Duck Dynasty"", and Anthony Sabato (who, as the scroll below his image reminded us had done underwear ads for Calvin Klein) all dog-whistled ominous warnings about ""Keeping America Safe"" and lecturing us about ""What it Means to Be an American"".  Even the former Navy Seal, Marcus Lutrell, (the Lone Wolf) who might have had something real to say about veterans' issues, conflated war in Afghanistan with war in the streets at home with chilling certainty: ""In order for any life to matter—we all have to matter. You hear? ….Your war is here.""
 
The prejudice and divisiveness that has been Trump's message throughout the campaign turned from dog-whistle to trumpet with Congressman Mike McCaul's appearance. Although McCaul serves as Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, he identified himself publically only as one of Trump's ""national security advisers"". There was not even a nod to the good people of the Texas' 10th District which he serves. McCaul's speech was about ""taking back our country"" –and it sounded more like a call to violence than a call for party unity. ""We need to end sanctuary cities, keep dangerous people out of our country, and secure our borders once and for all.""
 
McCaul's ugly rhetoric was echoed in subsequent speeches by Milwaukee County Sherriff, David Clarke, and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani was particularly frenetic raising the spectre of our ""enemies"".  Giuliani, ended his speech with a warning to these enemies: ""You know who you are, and we are coming to get you.""
 
So much for the Republican Party's hopes of attracting new voters, and expanding its base. The Trump delegates, and supporters seemed lock-stepped in his alternative reality of an America crouched in fear and in danger every minute. 
 
A live commentary on 538.com reminded readers that the statistics that last night's speakers were citing were completely wrong—but what good did that do the terrified voters who were watching television instead of reading Nate Silver and his team of realists on the web.
 
This is clearly going to be a campaign built on fear, and one that  accuses both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party for allowing the danger to exist. The message last night was that only Donald Trump can protect America. The language used was sometimes apocalyptic, and sometimes messianic—but always focused on the singularity of the presumptive nominee.

That's why the convention had to be about Trump and not the Republican Party. Last night Trump configured the campaign not as a two-party system working its way through the democratic process; but as a mano-a-mano, single battle between himself and Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump knows he can't beat the Democratic candidate; but he does think he can beat a demonized Hillary Clinton. 
 
To that end, a parade of speakers came forward to witness how Hillary (and Obama) were responsible for the deaths of their sons and loved ones. Make no mistake, my heart aches for the real grief of these families—but let's get real. 

Accusing Hillary of killing people in Benghazi, accusing Obama of allowing people to be killed by undocumented immigrants and accusing the Black Lives Matter movement of  causing the murder of police officers is deranged logic and to ""weaponize"" people's grief is dangerously dishonest. The final two speakers ended the evening by joining the frantic chanting from the audience: ""Lock her up!"" 
 
Trump showed his hand last night. This election is a battle he is going to fight his way. He has left no room for advice from Republican leadership, and he has no room on his Brioni coattails for any other Republican candidates. It is also going to be a vicious fight, and it's going to be personal.  
 
(Oh, and yes—the beautiful, but hapless, Melania spoke last night. She was introduced by The Donald who appeared first in shadow and emerged to the strains of the illegally played ""We Are Champions."" Grabbing the mic like an aging lounge-lizard, Trump kept breathing into it: ""We are gonna win so big.""
 
Melania, for her part, had learned her speech. The fact that it sounded as if it was written by a college essay tutor, or a Miss Universe consultant was not her fault. But it turns out that even the banality provided by the speechwriter was unoriginal. Many of the sections were plagiarized from Michelle Obama's speech at the 2008 convention. We did, however, learn that as First Lady Melania would ""help children and women.""  Well, that's inclusiveness, I guess.)

After what we saw in Cleveland yesterday, it seems that though that War is very much alive--did you read the RNC Platform? -- there are more targets too.

TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN PARTY
 by Tanya Melich
  
Watching the Republican convention yesterday made me physically sick.  Trump, guided by aides who had been Nixon acolytes in the Watergate scandal, had choreographed an ugly show of fear and hate.  The evening was described as ""Make America Safe Again."" It should have been labeled ""Make America Frightened Again.""
 
Trump presented a sinister production that reached its climax with the ranting of retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn who encouraged the delegates to consider America going to war so Trump could lead the nation to victory.
 
Flynn called on Hillary ""to leave this race now"" and like a high school cheerleader exhorted the delegates in sing-song chant: ""Lock her up. Lock her up."" ending with ""Wake up America. You can't sit this one out"".  (While he seemed to be referring to delegates working in the election, I got the sense he was also talking about a war on Islamists and illegal immigrants.)
 
Flynn reminds one of General Curtis Le May who wanted to use nuclear weapons against the Russians and was the prototype for the nuke-tough American general in the Dr. Strangelove movie. That Flynn is a defense advisor to Trump and was reputed to have been seriously considered to be Trump's running mate requires one to seriously pause.  Would Flynn be Secretary of Defense in a Trump administration?
 
Trump's crudeness and his lack of civil discourse that has been so visibly evident during his campaign was on display in his choice of other speakers.

To put a grieving mother who lost her foreign service son in the Benghazi attack on national television was cruel.  As she had all year, this mother blamed Hillary for her son's death.  The idea that Hillary caused his death and does not too mourn for Americans lost is ludicrous.
 
Probably the saddest performance of the evening went to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  After rightfully paying tribute to law enforcement officers and saying that Americans of all types, races should unite, he raised the temperature in the hall by describing an America overwhelmed with crime and violence. (Even though the nation presently has an historically low crime rate overall.)
 
For the first time all evening, the entire convention was electrified.  Delegates rose to their feet as Giuliani in loud staccato phrases attacked Hillary and the Democrats for being soft on crime and promised, ""What I did for New York, Trump will do for America."" His performance was that of a classic demagogue and would fit nicely in books that categorize fascist rhetoric.
 
The Bushes, Mitt Romney, John McCain, John Kasich and all those other Republican leaders who decided not to attend this convention were right.  I'm sorry I took the time to watch the demise of what was once a respected political party.  It is now the means for a sick, power hungry man to satisfy his appetites.
 
Trump claims he won the most Republican votes in the primaries and thus is supported by the majority of his party. He is wrong. According to a July 16th article by Jon Ward, senior political correspondent for Yahoo ""when the contested phase of the primary essentially ended in early May, Trump had roughly ll million votes compared to 17 million"" for all the other presidential GOP candidates.
 
For nearly my entire adult life, I worked to elect Republican candidates and left
when the party turned against the rights of women.  The spectacle I watched last night was worse than anything I've ever experienced.  I was at the 1964 San Francisco convention when Barry Goldwater was nominated and walked out of the
l992 Houston convention when President George H.W. Bush with his Lee Atwater- led team turned the convention over to Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson and Jerry
Falwell.
 
Cleveland is worse than San Francisco or Houston.  I don't know whether I have the stomach to watch the next three nights.  The party of Trump is a disgrace to the nation and must be particularly painful to those Republican delegates and members at home who watched as Trump orchestrated their party into the image of a pathological bully.  
 
America deserves better.  Monday night at the Cleveland Republican convention will be remembered as one of the meanest displays of crudeness and fear mongering in our nation's political history.

SUPERMAN NEEDED
Cory Booker for Hillary VP
By Elena Coyle
 
A lot has been said, not all of it positive, about Cory Booker's unusual compassion and human touch.  From moonlighting as Newark's most overqualified snow-shoveler, to literally saving constituents from a burning building, he has been dubbed a superman of sorts – first to Brick City, and later, to his state.  Ellen even (in)famously gifted him the costume to match.  We may roll our eyes, but we should not allow our own cynicism to blind us to who Cory Booker really is: a hero.  And we could use a hero right about now.

November portends the most important presidential election that many of us will ever see.  While this warning resurfaces each election cycle, something deep in our collective unconscious tells us that, it's true.  In the eleven months since the first Republican debate, we have witnessed the ascendancy of a candidate who threatens the very core of our constitution, civil rights and basic sense of human decency.  And all this at a time when our country has witnessed more heart-wrenching and unthinkable acts of violence than most of us can bear.  We are, more so than ever, waiting for our superman.

Cory Booker is as intelligent and he is deep – as qualified as he is humble.  Receiving a BA and MA from Stanford, a second MA as a Rhodes Scholar from Oxford and a JD from Yale, Cory Booker had any number of future prospects available to him, many of which could have be quite lucrative. But instead, Cory Booker chose to dedicate his life to the service of others – moving to Newark to start a non-profit organization that provided legal services to low income families. 

Like Hillary herself, Cory Booker has worked tirelessly throughout his career to improve the lives of our country's most vulnerable men and woman. At age 29, he was elected to Newark's City Council, and in 2006, he was elected Newark's Mayor; a post he held for 7 years. Then, in a 2013 Special Election, he was chosen to represent New Jersey as United States Senator. In 2014, Senator Booker was re-elected to a full 6 year term.
 
An effective mayor turned Senator, Cory Booker is as at much at home on Capitol Hill as among the smokestacks of Newark. Though he could not fully transform his city, beleaguered by decades of corruption and poverty, he never stopped trying. And what he did restore was hope in a place and a people that America forgot.  He brought hundreds of millions of private investment dollars to Newark – during the Great Recession no less. Through investment, economic development and social reform, he transformed a fallen city into a pillar of progress. 

And in the Senate, he continues the fight for New Jersey, and the country's least advantaged citizens, with the introduction and support of legislation advancing prison reform, gun control, education, healthcare and social welfare programs.  There is no doubt that he would carry this fight to the White House in continued support of these important causes.
 
Moreover, Cory Booker as the Vice Presidential pick would surely inspire people of color, who overwhelmingly support Hillary, to turn out to vote.  Cory Booker's presence on the Democratic ticket would also be a visible re-statement that the Democratic party is committed to diversity in the Nation's highest office.  

More than this, in no small way, the election of Barack Obama brought the hope of a dialogue among the races on the question of race. This dialogue, for many reasons beyond the President's control, never came to full fruition. But it is a necessary precursor to concrete policies that will resolve interrelated, systemic problems, like poverty, lack of educational opportunities and mass incarceration. The tragedies of Ferguson, Dallas and Baton Rouge are in part the consequences of our country's failure to directly confront the issue of race, and a reminder that we can no longer delay in doing so. As history has demonstrated, change is brought about not only by movements, but by leaders. Cory Booker has the perspective, experience and compassion to ensure progress.
 
As Vice President, Cory Booker would be not only an agent for racial harmony, but would stand in his very being for true racial equality – a standard that has eluded our country since the last generation took up this cause more than 50 years ago.
 
When I survey the unenviable task of rescuing our country from perennial war, income inequality and racial tension (among many woes) – quite frankly, this looks like a job for Superman.

A DREAMER FOR THE DREAMERS
The Case for Julian Castro as Hillary's VP
by Lisa Tejeda

Julian Castro is the future of our country.  
 
His life itself is a testimony to the fact that the American Dream is still alive and well at a moment in time in our world when many familiar ways of life have changed. 

Castro is a graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law School. At 26 he became the youngest city councilman in San Antonio's history, and subsequently its youngest mayor. He served three times as mayor of San Antonio, the country's seventh-largest city. At present Julian Castro is in President Obama's Cabinet serving as the Director of Housing and Urban Development. He is not yet 42. 

Julian Castro-  achild from a family of struggling immigrants, raised by a single mother, dreamed the dream, worked the work, and from the meek and humble a mighty young leader has risen!
 
Julian Castro can give voice to the American Dream, its weaknesses and triumphs. Our economy has changed from fabrication to automation. Office clerks and secretaries are replaced by computers, copy machines, and ever changing technologies. The economy has recovered, but there are many left behind. We have to remember the American Dream and rework it, and we need someone who can give real truth to its meaning.

Julian Castro has been the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development since July 28, 2014.  Though many people may not be aware of this, HUD is a branch of the federal government with very broad reach. Its mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all Americans. Millions of people have avoided foreclosures through HUD. Veterans receive housing assistance through HUD. It is HUD which provides emergency housing assistance to many after natural disasters. Since 1934, HUD has administered FHA loans which have enabled many Americans to buy their homes, by guaranteeing their mortgages to lending banks. Every day, millions of Americans receive some small or large benefit through the existence of HUD.
 
As a member of President Obama's Cabinet, Julian Castro has had the advantage of being present at critical cabinet meetings. This has given him access and exposure to the many issues facing the nation which engage the entire cabinet and the President.

Julian Castro doesn't just understand the struggles of minorities. He is himself Hispanic. He knows the challenges many immigrant and minority families face because of their ethnic and cultural backgrounds. He is what Donald Trump wants white Americans to fear, and yet all Americans, regardless of ethnicity, will soon learn to love him.
 
His presence as Vice President will help heal the wounds that the Trump campaign has inflicted on our nation in the past year.

He will also help to attract Latino voters, who will constitute a critical demographic in November. He might even put Texas in play for the Presidential Election.
 
Julian Castro is young and this too is an enormous benefit. The Millennial Generation came out in force to vote in the primary election and now during the General Election they need a voice to connect with. They need a voice that represents their future, that is nearer in age and demographic to the life and society they will and do live in.
 
Millennials are now the largest demographic in the Unites States.  They have passed the Baby boomers. We cannot follow the example of the British with Brexit and disregard their voice or its power. Almost every other person being discussed for the Vice Presidency is over 55. They simply do not have the ""life experience"" to relate to the Millennials or the ""rest of us.""
 
To me, Julian Castro is the Vice Presidential candidate that Secretary Clinton should choose. I hope she does.

A WILD CARD CHOICE
RICH CORDRAY FOR HILLARY VP
by Nick Smyth

Ohio's Richard Cordray is the best VP option for Hillary.  Cordray can help Hillary get elected and can help her be an even more terrific president. Now the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Cordray, age 57, has won statewide Attorney General and Treasurer elections in Ohio.  He can help Hillary in the critical Buckeye State - and well beyond.
 
I know Rich from the four years I spent working with him at the CFPB.  He would work tirelessly to help Hillary win the White House, would strengthen the ticket geographically and with critical constituencies, and would be a terrific VP, able to take on complex policy challenges and find novel solutions.  I know because I've seen him do it multiple times at the CFPB.  Cordray was brought to the CFPB by now-Senator Elizabeth Warren, when she was there building the new agency in Jan. 2011.  In Jan. 2012, when it became clear that Senate Republicans would never confirm Warren to serve as the CFPB Director, President Obama nominated Rich to serve as the CFPB's Director.
 
Rich went through challenging, vigorous and sometimes mean-spirited confirmation hearings – Senate Republicans and industry opponents wanted to find reasons not to confirm him, but couldn't.  Despite well-funded campaigns by the U.S. Chamber and others seeking to tarnish the new agency and its leader, they learned that Cordray has no ""baggage"" and he was ultimately confirmed by the Senate.

A whip-smart former Marshall Scholar, Jeopardy Champion, and U.S. Supreme Court Clerk (where he's also argued seven cases), Cordray has built the CFPB from a small team that landed on the consumer protection beachhead into an incredibly successful and effective advocate for consumers across the country - that has garnered broad bipartisan support. The agency has cracked down on abusive payday lenders, for-profit colleges, and companies that cheated veterans and service members; it has ordered banks and other financial institutions to return more than $11 billion to consumers who were subjected to illegal tricks and traps.
 
And despite forcing them to follow the rules, industry players describe Rich as reasonable and willing to listen. Rich has testified 30 times in front of hostile Republicans on the Hill, and he has always kept his cool, pushing back strongly and effectively against unfair attacks. He's an excellent debater and would enthusiastically serve as attack dog against Donald Trump's nonsense.
 
Rich has won local and statewide elections over and over in Ohio, with strong labor support in that critical state. Unlike any other VP candidate under consideration, he would appeal to both the ""Warren wing"" that includes many former and current Sanders supporters and the working class White voters that are essential to winning OH, PA, FL, and other key states.  Hillary can have all of that without having to sacrifice a Democratic Senate seat necessary to assuring what might be a razor thin majority.

MY Choice for Hillary's VP. Sherrod Brown of Ohio
By Jan Bernstein
 
The VP choice. A choice for Hillary to veer left of center. A choice for Hillary to make clear where her other appointees and some policies may land. A chance to pick up state and electoral support. A chance to balance the Democratic ticket. 
 
My choice for her to pick is Sherrod Brown. He is the left leaning senior United States Senator from Ohio since January 3, 2007. In 2011, in the National Journal's annual rankings, Brown tied with eight other members for the title of the most liberal member of Congress.
 
Before his election to the Senate, he was a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Ohio's 13th congressional district from 1993 to 2007.
 
On November 7, 2006, Brown faced two-term incumbent senator Mike DeWine in the general election. Brown won the seat with 56% of the vote to DeWine's 44%.
 
Brown stood for reelection in 2012, defeating opponent Josh Mandel 51% to 45%.

He is popular in Ohio and all through the Rust Belt--a feisty, down to earth person who connects with blue collar workers on trade and the economy. The  fact that his wife, Connie Schultz,  is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist won't hurt with women either.
 
Yes, if Hillary picks him, Republican Governor John Kasich gets to pick a Republican to replace him, but we have to win the White House, and to win the White House, we have to win Ohio. If we win at the top of the ticket, the Democrats have a  good chance to win back the Senate even without Senator Brown from Ohio.

Hillary needs to reach white male voters in Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and  Pennsylvania. Sherrod Brown is the best opportunity to build that bridge for Hillary and to convince blue collar workers not to vote against their own best interest in the upcoming election . The presumptive Republican nominee is no friend of  working people , and a Clinton- Brown ticket will make that fact clear, and will separate reality from reality tv. 
 
We need Sanders' left wing millennials too.  The other left leaning Senator being vetted, Senator Warren from the already blue Massachusetts delivers this demographic but not the other.
 
We elect Presidents by the electoral college. Therefore, may I repeat. It's Ohio. It's Ohio. It's Ohio. Clinton- Brown 2016.
 
Sherrod Brown for VP.  Take it away, John King. November 8, 2016.

BOLD AND BODACIOUS: HILLARY CLINTON AND ELIZABETH WARREN FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT

Gender equality took a grand leap forward when Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren joined forces in matching light blue - a bright and empowering image of two brilliant leaders enjoying their first shoulder to shoulder campaign appearance on June 27 at the Cincinnati  Museum Center. 

Elizabeth Warren declared:  ""Hillary has brains, she has guts, she has thick skin and steady hands, but most of all, she has a good heart. And that's what America needs [and] that's why I'm with her!  You know, I could do this all day."" Warren joined the fervent audience chant: ""Hillary! Hillary! as the first woman presumptive Democratic Party nominee stepped up to the podium.  Energized and smiling, Hillary Clinton proclaimed, ""You just saw why Elizabeth Warren is considered so terrific, so formidable — because she tells it like it is.  I have to say, I just love to see how she gets under Donald Trump's thin skin.""   (Check out Warren's ""queen of slay"" Drumpf tweets.)

This high-spirited twosome kickoff set me and many others hoping for a Clinton-Warren ticket - a ground breaking one-two punch to the 228 years of U.S. male presidencies.  This team would be a powerful antidote to the charges that Hillary is too establishment.  Clinton-Warren as running mates, a huge symbolic smash through the glass ceiling,  would represent a dramatic change in the U.S. political scene.

Elizabeth Warren brings a clear economic-populist progressive bridge to the Sanders camp, working class voters, and independents.  Warren's anti-Wall Street perspective, consumer advocacy and opposition to the TPP would widen Hillary's wheel base.  Warren says, ""Supporters of the TPP want you to believe this deal is about America's role in setting the rules of international trade. But here's the problem, TPP isn't about helping American workers set the rules, it's about letting giant corporations rig the rules.""  Hillary's choice to have Warren run would reinforce for voters her opposition to the TPP which many continue to doubt.  

Their unifying trailblazing candidacy for President and Vice President of the United States is what our troubled grieving nation needs now.  They would reinforce each other's strengths and shared values, challenge each other's differences, and continue the urgent call for equality and justice.  

Two women on the ticket?  Hillary's 1969 Wellesley commencement address: ""The challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible.""  Let's go for it!

Clare Coss is a playwright, librettist and activist.  Her play, Emmett, Down in My Heart, about the events surrounding the 1955 murder in Mississippi of 14 year old Emmett Till, will be produced in German by Berlin's Afro-German Theatre, Label Noir, in 2017.  Her opera, Emmett Till, with composer Mary Watkins, will be presented next year by the Harlem Lyric Theater & Opera Co.

A COMPELLING PROPOSAL
Tim Kaine for Hillary VP

By Sarah Kovner

The old adage ""that a vice presidential candidate should do no harm"" speaks to the choice of Senator Tim Kaine, a moderate non-controversial Democrat.  But I see a more compelling case for choosing the Virginia Senator.

We all know, or should, that before he was a Senator, Kaine was the Governor of Virginia and DNC chairman at the same time, and before that he was Mayor of Richmond.

What most people don't know is that after graduating from Harvard Law School he spent 17 years practicing law in Richmond representing people who had been denied housing opportunities because of their race or disability.

What we also don't know is that the Senator took a break from Harvard to work as a Catholic missionary in Honduras where he learned his fluent Spanish. Indeed, when i saw him in Georgia campaigning for Michelle Nunn in 2014, he was specifically meeting with Spanish-speaking Hispanic entrepreneurs and other community groups.

As a prime architect of President Obama's Iran deal in 2015, Senator Kaine demonstrated his ability to work across party lines with Senator Corker while maintaining his principles of diplomacy first.

I have known Tim Kaine personally since 2009 and I want to say that he is committed to progressive values and works to achieve them in a collaborative way. I think we all believe we need more of that in Washington and indeed in the country as a whole. He also has 100% rating from Planned Parenthood and says that ""the right role for government is to let women make their own decision.""

And while i can make a case (different though it may be) for Senators Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren or Cory Booker, when Tim Kaine becomes Vice President, his replacement will be chosen by a Democratic Governor. The same cannot be said of the others at a time when we vitally need a Democratic Senate.

And one last thought.  Almost blue Virginia borders on purple North Carolina which could help bring  the Tar Heel State along.

BLogging for Hillary is now Voices4Hillary. CHOOSING THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT/HOW IT HAPPENS by Ann F. Lewis begins our series: 
Who Will Hillary Pick? - a Series of Provocative Advocacies About Possible VP Choices.  

Ann was Senior Advisor to Hillary Clinton's 2008 Presidential campaign. She served as White House Director of Communications for President Bill Clinton; as Political Director of the Democratic National Committee and as Chair of the DNC Women's Vote Center.  Here is her inside scoop on how the process of choosing a VP happens.

CHOOSING THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT
HOW IT HAPPENS by Ann F. Lewis
            
Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination for President in 2016 by campaigning for and receiving 15,805,136 votes throughout the primary process.  For those still keeping score, her current delegate vote total is 2,765.  When she announces her Vice Presidential candidate, that person will have received one vote – hers. 

In fact, in recent Democratic party history, the choice for a vice presidential candidate has almost always been made by the Presidential nominee. The exception is Adlai Stevenson in 1956, who threw the nomination open to the convention. John F. Kennedy lost to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee that year; no one has been inspired to follow his example since. 

It is of course theoretically possible, even after the Presidential nominee has announced her choice, that a majority of the delegates could decide to vote for someone else. It is also theoretically possible that the convention would be welcomed with a solar eclipse. I wouldn't count on either. 

There may be private disagreements:  There was  certainly grumbling in 1940 when word got out that Franklin Delano Roosevelt wanted Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace as his Vice President. The grumbling grew so loud that Eleanor Roosevelt – at the urging of Frances Perkins – flew to Chicago to address the delegates. ""This is no ordinary time."" she told them, urging them to honor the President's choice. And they did. 

Robert Kennedy- the most valued member of his brother's inner circle- was definitely not pleased to learn that John Kennedy had decided on Lyndon Johnson. He made his objections clear- but it was JFK who had the deciding vote. 

So the President's choice it will be. After all, by whatever process the delegates were chosen, they come to the convention agreed in wanting the strongest possible campaign in the fall – a unity of purpose that grows every time Donald Trump opens his mouth! 

What are the political lessons of recent past selections? First, I suggest, forget geography. Lyndon Johnson may have made a geographic difference in 1960, but that kind of Boston to Austin match hasn't worked since (Ask President Dukakis of Massachusetts and his Texas running-mate, Senator Lloyd Bentsen).

Another lesson:  In 1984, Gerry Ferraro made history with courage and grace. The announcement that she was Walter Mondale's choice for Vice-President evoked great enthusiasm within the party –but then set off a roar of press criticism she was not immediately ready to rebut.  Defeating the popular Ronald Reagan was never going to be easy; Gerry deserved a better introduction.
 
We've learned. Once the VP choice was made at the convention; today we expect it to come before,  maximizing the opportunity to make positive news, and enabling the campaign to work with the chosen candidate earlier, so that everyone is prepared for the tsunami of attention to come. 

From the selection of Harry Truman in 1948 to Joe Biden sixty years later, probably the most consistent  factor in vice presidential nominees has been to choose a partner in governing: someone who shares the Presidential nominee's values, and can help enact and implement the Presidential agenda. 

I don't know who the nominee will be this time; but Hillary Clinton has an impressive set of options for her Vice-Presidential choice –leaders who are committed to progressive principles, with  admirable records of public service.  I'm eager to learn her decision!

Alison Bernstein, Mo Mowlam, Hillary Clinton
3 Leaders In Sync  By Marie Wilson

This Sunday's New York Times reported the death of Alison Bernstein, an amazing leader who, while during her four decades at the Ford Foundation (1982-2010) placed her bets on so many of the early women's movement activities in the US and around the world.  
 
Our paths crossed in 1984 when I left a political office in Iowa to lead the Ms. Foundation for Women. The foundation was low on cash, and I was thrilled when some of my new colleague invited me for a drink that included one of Ford's top program officers, Alison Bernstein. I'll never forget my awe of this deep voiced, confident woman who ordered Makers Mark Scotch, and kept the table spellbound with her brilliance.
 
At that time and for the next two decades, the US women's movement was one foundation away from welfare: Ford. President Susan Berresford and Allison were often responsible for those of us who survived. 

When 20 years later I realized that the work of our Ms. grantees could not continue if a diversity of women were not in political office, I left the foundation to begin the White House Project where we used the growing conversation about the Presidency to jump start a movement to get a diverse group of women to enter politics up to and including the Presidency.
 
Allison understood our work, and funded us for what became a turning point in our success: a National Press Club gathering, what we called Why Women Matter. With Ford's support we brought women leaders from those countries who were already advancing women's leadership in politics, and US women's groups struggling to do the same into the National Press Club.  
 
One of the leaders was Mo Mowlam, a British MP who played a major role in the peace process in Northern Ireland.  I had heard about Mowlam from women who traveled with Hillary Clinton, and came by to tell me that Mo was astounding.  Mowlam had been diagnosed with cancer, and by that time had lost her hair and wore a wig. When things got too hot, she supposedly just took it off and tossed it across the room.  
 
Mowlam's bravery in bringing the settlement to that war-torn place was legend. When Blair was introduced to celebrate the new peace agreement he got tepid applause. But they raised the roof when Mowlam stood.  
 
I couldn't wait for her to speak at our event that day, but we all had to:  Mowlam dashed into the press club late, but just in time to take the podium.  She was a disheveled mess with fresh coffee stains dripping down her chest.  She had stopped to see Hillary and changed clothes in the cab. But she didn't miss a beat. She looked out over the audience, beat on the podium, and, with the wonderful authority that was hers, barked ""Confidence, that's what women need, confidence!""  I have never before or since been as impressed by a female politician as I was at that moment and throughout her address.  She died of cancer soon afterwards. But I will always remember her for her wisdom and bravery and her devotion to Clinton.
 
Allison, Mowlam and Clinton…..three stunning women.We didn't miss out on Alison…she followed up her career at Ford as Director of the Rutgers' Institute for Women's Leadership where she championed a new agenda, including the creation of the Gloria Steinem Endowed Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies.  Nor did we miss out on Mowlam….While the world would have been safer had she lived, her feat in Northern Ireland was historical.
 
And if many of the women of this country and the world have our say, we will not miss out on the step we most need to take in the US by Clinton's election. As Mowlam beat out on that podium then, let's beat on every podium across the US that has any doubts about Clinton as the legacy of Bernstein and Mowlam. Confidence, people, confidence; that's what we need.

1746239085597087_1761168504104145,"Frederick Davie, Executive-Vice President of Union Theological Seminary in New York City, writes movingly about Taming the Beast of Bigotry in America

Bigotry in America is real. It is ontological. It has being. Fear and insecurity are its lifeblood. It presents in all forms. Overt. Ugly. Aggressive. Lethal. Subtle. Micro. Genteel. 
 
And we feed our American beast of bigotry with fears of all kinds and arm it with guns, and so it metastasizes into a mass killer of men, women and children.

Consider its impact on the 500 children in the Montessori school where Philando Castile worked; on the daughter of his girlfriend; and on the millions of ritualistically marginalized and economically deprived families of single mothers and their children who are shut off from prosperity and opportunity in America. 
        
We've all heard it.
 
We have nothing against them. 
 
We just don't want them in our schools, our pools, our restaurants, our neighborhoods, our residential spaces, our offices, our beaches, our country clubs, our congregations.
 
This bigotry becomes its most animated, virulent, hateful self when in the presence of blackness. And male blackness seems to trigger in bigotry deadly, uncontrolled spasms, wreaking lethal havoc, again and again and again. Seemingly totally out of control.
 
In the wake of bigotry's lethal orgasmic explosions emerges a national ritual of temporary contrition. 
 
""We can never allow this degree of compulsive bigoted, murderous excess,"" we solemnly profess with much weeping and wailing and mourning.
 
We promise to reform this bigoted being, which is within our own hearts and minds. Like regretful and worn down addicts, we swear to get It – the beast -- under control, even to root it out. 
 
But then we don't. We never do.
 
And murderous, ole bigotry goes back to masquerading as something else, something more socially acceptable until, with enough time passing, our fears and insecurity stoke again its murderous rage.
 
Hillary Clinton, when President, should elicit the support of former President Obama, the Congressional Black Caucus, other Congressional members of color, progressive members of Congress, enlightened police officials and community leaders to plan, design and implement a set of conversations on race, community/police relations, and what it means to be one United States of America.  These conversations should be monthly in different regions of the country over the course of a year. Followed in subsequent years by bi-annual national convening

And there should be concrete outcomes from these discussions, specific proposals -- and actions -- to reform criminal justice and policing, as well as address the festering educational, economic and social inequality that underlies the beast of bigotry. 

Nothing short of sustained, long-term, intentional, honest, unrelenting, irrepressible engagement will tame this ugly beast. It's all in our hands.

1746239085597087_1761163980771264,"In this important letter,  written in the pain of the recent killings and violence, Hillary seeks to heal the divisions and unite Americans in support of a fairer, respectful and safer society for all. 

Friend -- 

Like so many people across America, I have been following the news of the past few days with horror and grief.

On Tuesday, Alton Sterling, father of five, was killed in Baton Rouge -- approached by the police for selling CDs outside a convenience store. On Wednesday, Philando Castile, 32 years old, was killed outside Minneapolis -- pulled over by the police for a broken tail light.

And last night in Dallas, during a peaceful protest related to those killings, a sniper targeted police officers -- five have died: Brent Thompson, Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Michael Smith, and Lorne Ahrens. Their names, too, will be written on our hearts.

What can one say about events like these? It's hard to know where to start. For now, let's focus on what we already know, deep in our hearts: There is something wrong in our country.

There is too much violence, too much hate, too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn't be. No one has all the answers. We have to find them together. Indeed, that is the only way we can find them.

Let's begin with something simple but vital: listening to each other.

White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about seen and unseen barriers faced daily. We need to try, as best we can, to walk in one another's shoes. To imagine what it would be like if people followed us around stores, or locked their car doors when we walked past, or if every time our children went to play in the park, or just to the store to buy iced tea and Skittles, we said a prayer: ""Please God, don't let anything happen to my baby.""

Let's also put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous job we need them to do. Remember what those officers in Dallas were doing when they died: They were protecting a peaceful march. When gunfire broke out and everyone ran to safety, the police officers ran the other way -- into the gunfire. That's the kind of courage our police and first responders show all across America.

We need to ask ourselves every single day: What can I do to stop violence and promote justice? How can I show that your life matters -- that we have a stake in another's safety and well-being?

Elie Wiesel once said that ""the opposite of love is not hate -- it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death -- it's indifference.""

None of us can afford to be indifferent toward each other -- not now, not ever. We have a lot of work to do, and we don't have a moment to lose. People are crying out for criminal justice reform. People are also crying out for relief from gun violence. The families of the lost are trying to tell us. We need to listen. We need to act.

I know that, just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people.

I'm talking about criminal justice reform the day after a horrific attack on police officers. I'm talking about courageous, honorable police officers just a few days after officer-involved killings in Louisiana and Minnesota. I'm bringing up guns in a country where merely talking about comprehensive background checks, limits on assault weapons and the size of ammunition clips gets you demonized.

But all these things can be true at once.

We do need police and criminal justice reforms, to save lives and make sure all Americans are treated as equal in rights and dignity.

We do need to support police departments and stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect us.

We do need to reduce gun violence.

We may disagree about how, but surely we can all agree with those basic premises. Surely this week showed us how true they are.

I've been thinking today about a passage from Scripture that means a great deal to me -- maybe you know it, too:

""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.""

There is good work for us to do, to find a path ahead for all God's children. There are lost lives to redeem and bright futures to claim. We must not lose heart.

May the memory of those we've lost light our way toward the future our children deserve.

Thank you, 

Hillary

JUST MY OPINION
By Linda Ellerbee
 
All day I've been told — online, on the air, and on the street — how shocked I should be, how outraged, what an atrocity this is. What happened last night in Dallas was horrible — and is never justified, but grief is the right response. Shock is not.
 
What the hell did we expect was going to happen?
 
Dallas was a violent reaction to violence, a blacklash, if you will, against the unarguable fact that for too many years, too many cops have been able to kill too many black citizens and not be held responsible for it, culminating earlier this week in two more young black men killed by police officers. Dallas was no more an atrocity than Louisiana or Minnesota.
 
Dallas was also the unsurprising result of too many damn guns. We cannot have it both ways. We can't point to the 2nd Amendment and say we need an armed citizenry to protect us from a rogue government, then act surprised when an armed citizen attacks what he believes is a nation of rogue cops.
 
There is more than enough grief to go around. Be nice if we could share that today instead of more outrage. More hate. Hate and guns. Guns and hate. We've cooked up a mighty toxic stew, and our pot boileth over.
 
I'm white. I've never had to instruct my son and grandsons how to behave so as not to get themselves killed for having a non-working taillight on a car, or sassing a cop, or simply insisting on their dignity. But I stand with those mothers. I mourn for their dead children. And I mourn for those dead police officers in Dallas. However, blue is not better than black. Cop lives do not matter more than black lives. Life matters.
 
Just my opinion.
 
Here's another. I am for arming everyone in this country.
 
With cell-phone video cameras.
 
It's forcing us to see ourselves in ways journalism never did.

1746239085597087_1760462837508045,"Eleanor and Hillary with Blanche Wiesen Cook
Blogging for Hillary recently had the pleasure of talking with Blanche Wiesen Cook, Distinguished Professor of history at John Jay College in the City University of New York, author of the the best selling biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, volumes I andu II, and the soon-to-be published volume III. Here is what she had to say about the two most activist First Ladies in US History.

What do you think Eleanor would say about the idea of a former First Lady running and ultimately becoming President of the United States?

ER believed that democracy depended on organized movements, activist movements.  She refused to run for office because women were not organized sufficiently to be elected, or respected.  NOW women are organized and we must fortify our movements for change -- as ER encouraged us to do from the l920s forward: door to door, block by block.  

What are your thoughts about moving from First Lady to President?    
What wonderful insider knowledge -- from the WHITE HOUSE to the WHITE HOUSE, with years as secretary of state confronting the most perilous global issues.  A politician, a diplomat, a leader for our time --  a time of danger and peril requiring keen judgment, agile teamwork, profound understanding.

What qualities do you think Hillary shares with Eleanor?   
Like many strong women attorneys, educators, leaders in all fields, WOMEN are the BEST MULTI-TASKERS!  Wives, mothers, organizers, agitators.  Specifically, ER and HRC share a belief that peace requires economic security, education and training for all; full employment, health care and housing, dignity and respect.  The l935 social security act was meant to have medical security -- what we now call ""single payer "" which exists in all industrial nations; the AMA lobbied it to death from FDR to DDE -- when ER and her life-long friend Esther Lape lobbied for national health;  subsequently, the  AMA controlled health reinsurance corporations limited the vision of  HRC & Obama; now we must go forward -- on all these progressive fronts -- ER called for FREE public higher education as early as l943; she championed continuing life-long adult education for re-training, independence, personal empowerment!  Debt free education is a human right -- HRC and ER share the best values for the future, a people's economy without a predator class of truly greedy folks who  own and control elections in order to plunder democracy, a harmonious environment to sustain life on this one world we all do happen to share.

Many of us have been surprised by the level of racism that reared its ugly head aimed at President Obama during his presidency.  Do you think sexism will do the same during a Hillary presidency?
Racism and sexism are at large, world-wide; we must end the abuse of women and minorities world-wide;  our movements for peace and freedom, women's rights and human rights must be fortified in every community to battle the scourge of horror and hate which defines the 21st century.

Why are you supporting Hillary Clinton?   
HRC is the candidate of VISION and HOPE!  for justice, equity, human rights and DIGNITY FOR ALL

By John Howell

Each week for the last month, I've sat down to write about why voting for Hillary Clinton for President is the single most important step to be taken toward a better future than the present we're seeing now. And every week, some major event has crashed into my thoughts and disrupted them: terrorist attacks, the EU's immigration and political crisis, and most recently, the collapse of the polity of the United Kingdom, the one that most resembles ours.

It's hard to resist quoting Yeat's ""The Second Coming""—the common trope for such times since 1968—but it really does appear that ""the center cannot hold,"" and that rough beasts are slouching toward us from every direction. And what rough beasts: nationalist (read ""racist"") political movements on the rise throughout Europe, extremist fanatics bent on wreaking global terrorist mayhem, and, of course, that one-man wrecking crew of U.S. polity, Mr. Trump.

Against this bleak landscape, I see one possibility for at least an effective holding action against such serious threats, and just maybe, for some progress to be made: President Hillary Clinton.

It's all about perspective. Enlarge the field of vision by looking backward at the sweep of history for a sobering moment: you could start with the 1930s if you want to find unsettling parallels to today's events. Global economic distress, a rise in violence, fascist politics driven by ideologies of ethnic and national righteousness, a failure of progressive leadership to persuade general populations, an angry pushback against all authority—pick your power point topic and you can make several slides of connections between the decade that set the stage for the most destructive event in human history—World War II— and today.

So what should we do? Read Freud (especially Civilization and its Discontents—published 1930, by the way) to prepare for the reality of the worst outcome? Yes, but that's not all.

Looking at the Big Picture, thinking beyond issues of character pros and cons, considering long-ago decisions and votes on complex issues, and acknowledging the considerable baggage of Bill, it's pretty obvious to me (has been since the beginning of the current campaign) that the best choice for the kind of clear-headed, fact- driven, realpolitik leadership that the country needs at this time is embodied by Hillary Clinton's experience, skills, and above all, her dedication of her life to public service. She, like many other smart, talented, and ambitious people, didn't have to choose the increasingly nasty arena of public life to earn a successful life. Her 37 years of political activity (Bill Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1979) should be counted as a major credit toward the country's highest office.

In this current media climate, in which headlines about ""presumptive candidate"" Thomas Jefferson would be ""slave-holder, draft dodger, and mixed-race fornicator,"" instead of ""brilliant polymath, visionary politician, and superb philosopher on the big issues,"" it's no surprise that the 24/7 cable news-driven machine spews negatives about Hillary Clinton on a regular basis. Ignore them. Any candidate with as long a public life as hers will own mistakes, arguable choices, and off- track fixations. Any candidate with the ambition to become president will have strong personality and behavioral tics (seriously ""normal"" human beings do not strive for high-level leadership positions in American politics). It's time to acknowledge the complexities of high achievers in our political realm as is common in other major public areas (sports, technology, entertainment).

A note for you wonderfully idealistic, thoroughly energetic, and altogether admirable Bernie-ites: if you do NOT vote for Hillary Clinton out of ideology and/or spite, you will see any chance for any part of the Sanders' program be buried under a President Trump, whose election you will be enabling by not supporting the other viable choice. Likewise, conscience voting for third party candidates, no matter how reasonable and self-satisfying, is a luxury that these perilous times can ill afford (c.f. the case of the President Gore we did not get, partly due to Mr. Nader's Quixote-ism). With President Hillary Clinton, you will have a shot at putting into action some, if not all, of a progressive program that has been effectively put into play.

So now, just do the right and good thing and vote for Hillary Clinton for President. Once she's in office, the real work of righting a wobbling world begins.

Forty Million Invisible Lives, One Visible Voice
Hillary and the Alzheimer's Caregivers

""Caregivers are invisible"".

Those were the opening remarks by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at a caregivers' conference in August, 2008.

Despite having dropped out of the Presidential race that morning, Senator Clinton still attended this event at the Jawonio center in Yonkers, New York, to call for federal funding for her ""Lifespan Respite Care Act"". The Lifespan Respite Care Act would provide caregivers with much needed breaks from their overwhelming responsibilities. As Senator Clinton reminded the audience that day, ""When the individual who needs care is housebound, the caregiver is also housebound"". Like the caregivers she was addressing, even though she had just suffered a very public and personal loss, Senator Clinton did not take ""time out"" from her responsibilities. She knew there was no respite on this issue. She advocated that day for individuals who had no voice, just as she had been doing for over thirty years.

I had been asked by the Alzheimer's Association to speak that day on behalf of Alzheimer's caregivers. My own mother had been sadly diagnosed with cognitive dementia a few years prior and I was caring for her 24/7 in my home. Prior to my mother's diagnosis, I had been married, was raising two children, had a career as an accountant, and was Treasurer of the local P.T.A. Within days of moving my mother into my home, I lost the first of many jobs.

Within weeks, my children became adept at taking care of themselves, including figuring out how to get themselves to school, soccer matches, and track meets. Within months, I had become an expert in medications, brain scans, Medicare rules, and EMS services. Within a year, I was isolated. I was also now a single mother, like so many in my situation, so I had to handle all of my increasing responsibilities alone. My only contact with the outside world was my children, my closest friends, my immediate neighbors, and the medical community. Former associates, coworkers, and acquaintances, disappeared. Despite being on the brink of bankruptcy, there were no PTA fund raisers for me or the other caregivers in our community. When I finally ran into a PTA member years later in the supermarket, she looked shocked to see me and exclaimed ""I thought you died"". No one thought to actually check on me during those years to see how I was doing and if I needed help. I had become invisible to the outside world.

But I was not invisible to Senator Clinton.

Senator Clinton's legislation revealed that millions of individuals in the U.S. (latest estimates are over 43 million) care for one or more family members or friends who are chronically ill, disabled, or terminally ill, and that nearly twenty- five percent of the elderly require help for their daily needs due to multiple chronic disabling conditions. As Senator Clinton noted in her legislation, approximately seventy-five percent of family caregivers are women, and while the caregiver role is personally rewarding, it can result in substantial emotional, physical, and financial hardship.

The Lifespan Respite Care Act was signed into law in December 2006, authorizing Congress to spend $53.3 million for respite for caregivers. But as of August 2008, Congress had yet to approve any funding. Senator Clinton was in Jawonio that day, facing an audience of caregivers, medical professionals, advocates, politicians, and the media, to press the case for funding. The response by the media was overwhelming silence. That night, television stations broadcasted Paris Hilton poolside in a bikini in a Presidential campaign spoof. Any coverage of the Jawonio event simply acknowledged Senator Clinton's attendance but focused on her role after the campaign. CNN's website merely notes that ""Clinton was in Yonkers, New York for a family and caregivers event"". There were no reports of the testimony of the desperate caregivers pleading their case that day. Even to the media, we caregivers were invisible.

This April, I met Secretary Clinton at an event on the campaign trail and seized the opportunity to speak with her about Alzheimer's and caregivers. Secretary Clinton immediately confirmed to me that she will continue her fight to provide services for family caregivers. Her platform for President specifies plans to invest $2 billion per year in research for Alzheimer's and related disorders. None of the other candidates had even drafted a plan to combat this devastating disease, nor did they have any specific proposals to help overburdened family caregivers.

Sadly my own mother has since passed away. I am now a voice for my invisible peers, advocating for them in Albany, New York and on Capitol Hill. But with presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton firmly in their corner, millions of invisible caregivers finally have a very visible voice.

Getting to know our neighbor, Hillary Clinton
By Ann Styles Brochstein

When the Clintons came to town in the summer of 1999, a strange thing happened in the Hamlet of Chappaqua. All of a sudden everyone, and I mean everyone, knew our name. There was no longer the need to spell C-H-A-P-P-A-Q-U-A to sales people on the phone making sure they weren't mistaking our town for Chappaquiddick. I was really struck by that when ordering backpacks for my kids from L.L. Bean, giving the salesperson my address and saying ""Let me spell that"" when the salesperson responded with a ""Oh, we know Chappaqua"".

At first, we were overrun with media trucks from every news outlet asking what we thought about the President & First Lady moving to our town. We didn't know what to think about them. They weren't New Yorkers, but that didn't matter so much as many residents were from elsewhere. Were they going to be neighbors or just residents? Then there were the drive bys past Old House Lane. We always knew when they were ""in residence"" by the constant presence of a police car at the end of their street. Many people, okay maybe it was just me, avoided going into town when they were around because of the media presence on every corner.

Once Bill left office & they became full time residents, things calmed down. There were Bill & Hillary sightings around town doing incredibly normal things like shopping at the local market, eating at local restaurants, walking through town, crashing block parties, Bill walking at the local high school track, shaking hands and taking photos with anyone who asked. Kids in town became so used to seeing them around that it became no big deal. Bill was clearly the natural politician, Hillary seemed to hang back and let him have the stage.  As time passed and they enthusiastically became part of our community, we also got to know Hillary. 

Now when I tell people I live in Chappaqua I'm immediately asked what it's like living in a town with a past & future president (I'm confident!). People want to know what she's like, do we see her around town, is she really as wonderful as her staff & people close to her say she is?  Is she approachable? The answer to all those questions is YES! The first thing one is immediately struck by in speaking with Hillary is her amazing ability to connect with whomever she is speaking to. She listens as if you're the only person in the room. She is warm, funny, caring, incredibly smart and inspiring, prompting one resident to call her ""Inspirer In Chief""! Her staff, her friends, people who do work for them at the house are incredibly devoted and protective. She & Bill are incredibly devoted & protective of them as well. They are regarded by all who know them to be wonderful people. There are countless stories of Hillary calling former staff members to ask how they, or family members are following a medical procedure for example.

At this year's Memorial Day Parade in Chappaqua, which she & Bill never miss marching in, she stopped to sign the cast of a young girl. Hillary asked her whether she was going to physical therapy once the cast was removed. The young girl said yes and Hillary told her to make sure to do all the exercises no matter how much it might hurt because it was important. Reporters were swarming around her, TV cameras were fixed on her, but she connected with that young girl in a very real human moment. 

My favorite conversation with Hillary was in January, at a fundraiser in White Plains, NY. She spoke for about 45 minutes, without notes, about everything from health care to income inequality to foreign policy. Afterward, I made sure to wiggle my way through the crowd to get a selfie with her. All the time I was ""wiggling"" I kept thinking about what I would say to her. I wanted it to be meaningful. The Secret Service was moving her forward, so I had to make sure I got ahead of them for a chance to speak to her. When it was my turn, she looked at me with the focused attention she gives everyone. I told her that my son was in the U.S. Navy, and that I was so grateful to her for never marginalizing service men and women by referring to them as ""boots on the ground"" as most of her opponents did.  Tears rolling down my face as I was saying this. She quickly gave me a hug, grabbed my phone and declared it was time for a selfie, which she's very good at by the way. Once she had taken a couple of selfies, she asked me to send one to my son and to thank him from her.

There are as many Hillary stories as there are residents in our tiny hamlet. I've had the pleasure and honor of chatting with her several times over the years about everything from sensible gun laws to what they're having for Thanksgiving, and each time I come away in awe of the woman who I know will be our 45th President.

""Elie shouldered the blessing and the burden of survival. In words and deeds, he bore witness and built a monument to memory to teach the living and generations to come the perils of human indifference.

""As he often said, one person of integrity can make a difference. For so many, he was that difference—including at the dedication of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1993 when he urged me to stop the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia; at the White House Millennium Lecture Hillary invited him to give; and in all his wonderful books and lectures.

""We send our deepest sympathies and prayers to Marion and Elisha, always grateful for the great love they shared with Elie and the strength it gave him, and for all the kindness and friendship he gave us."" 

President Obama said, ""Elie Wiesel was one of the great moral voices of our time, and in many ways, the conscience of the world.""  He raised his voice, not just against antisemitism but against hatred, bigotry and intolerance in all its forms.""

In 2009, Obama traveled with Wiesel and German chancellor Angela Merkel to the Nazi concentration camp of Buchenwald.

""After we walked together among the barbed wire and guard towers of Buchenwald where he was held as a teenager and where his father perished,"" Obama said, ""Elie spoke words I've never forgotten: 'Memory has become a sacred duty of all people of goodwill.'

""Upholding that sacred duty was the purpose of Elie's life.""

Who can ever forget his testimony in Iowa in 2011 when the 19 year old Zach defended his mothers and all LGBTQ families when a ban against Marriage Equality was on the legislators' table.  

Zach is a proud Hillary supporter and he explains why here.

Why I'm Supporting Hillary Clinton

By Zach Wahls

On the evening of Monday February 1, 2016, citizens all across my state packed into elementary school gyms and recreation centers — and yes, into farmhouses — for the Iowa caucuses. I joined tens of thousands of my fellow Iowans in caucusing for Hillary Clinton. With her campaign, she's clearly demonstrated that she will fight to protect and build on the progress we've made, be an advocate for families like mine, and provide progressive leadership in a time of domestic and international challenges.

Iowa Democrats take the caucuses seriously, and we have a pretty good record when it comes to launching the candidacies of would-be presidential nominees. (Our Republican friends, not as much.) Most of us had the chance to listen to candidates give speeches in person, and our airwaves, radio broadcasts, and even our billboards were flooded with political ads for months already. We give our decisions a lot of thought. That is why I caucused for Hillary in February, and why I am supporting her now, for the General Election.

Casting your lot in the political process is an incredibly personal decision driven by what is most important in your life. For me, that's family. When I was nineteen, Republicans in Iowa tried to reverse the 2009 Supreme Court decision that made same-sex marriage legal in our state. I spoke out against that proposed amendment at a public hearing in Des Moines. I talked about my family and how much marriage equality has meant to my two moms, Terry and Jackie. We beat that amendment, and for the last five and a half years, I've spent my life day in and day out advocating on behalf of LGBTQ people and families like mine.

The Republican Party is unified in its opposition to same-sex marriage, its refusal to prevent employment or housing discrimination, and its dedication to appointing Supreme Court justices who would overturn the Obergefell decision. Even their oft-obstreperous presumptive Presidential candidate has fallen in line on these issues, and we will likely see them engraved in the forthcoming platform of the Republican Convention. The important gains we've seen for transgender people from both the EEOC and the Pentagon could easily be washed away during a Republican administration. Losing the Presidency could prove catastrophic for the LGBTQ community. Not only would a Republican president bring our progress to a halt, he could actively undermine the gains we've made.

It's easy — especially for straight allies — to think that with marriage equality as the law of the land that our fight is over. The fight is not over. Hillary Clinton understands just how much work there is left to do, from continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS to continuing to expand protections for trans people. That's why as the proud son of two loving mothers, and as a young man deeply invested in the future of this country, I'm supporting her for President of the United States of America.

We need a president who is going to affirm that families like mine have a place in society and affirm the inherent worth and dignity and rights of all LGBTQ people. Hillary did that as Secretary of State when she declared that ""gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights,"" and she has continued to do that in this campaign. Just last week, she made history as the first presumptive nominee of a major party to march in a Gay Pride Parade. She marched 
In New York's Pride Parade, as she had done, when First Lady, in 2000.

In my 2011 speech at that hearing in Des Moines, I said that despite the challenges my family had faced, ""We're Iowans — we don't expect anyone to solve our problems for us. We'll fight our own battles. We just hope for equal and fair treatment from our government."" I know that Hillary will fight for that same equal treatment for all people and all families. Sons and daughters of loving parents, queer and straight alike, are counting on her. We couldn't have a better fighter in our corner, and I can't wait to see what she will do as President.

When I see Hillary campaigning I'm taken back to the time when, as First Lady, she brought her firepower to the fight for working women. I was the director of the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor. I know her passion for rights on the job and work/family balance has a long history.

Even with huge demands on her time, she met with working women across the country, from New York to New Mexico. We heard from women police officers, waitresses, accountants, factory workers, teachers, nurses and more. Their jobs could not have been more different but their issues could not have been more similar.

Hillary listened, and found a point of connection with every woman we talked to. From the grocery store clerk who told us that after 25 years she'd never make management because she was a woman, to the small business owner who said ""we participate in a conspiracy of silence,""

Hillary understood what they meant and that they spoke for millions. She especially identified with the stories of being a working mother – like the woman who ran red lights so she could get to the daycare center before the penalty fee kicked in.

She sympathized with their pain and yearning and sought real solutions. Those discussions inspired us to do the biggest voluntary survey ever, Working Women Count. Three hundred thousand women sent in their paper surveys (this was long before you did a survey on-line) from every state and territory, in 10 languages, with 1,000 partners including the YWCA, the Business and Women's Roundtable, a dozen daily newspapers and 20 unions.

The issues that emerged from that survey are the ones Hillary is fighting for today – equal pay, child care, paid time off, opportunities for advancement and respect.

The two decades since the survey have been hard on working people. Ironically, there are fewer differences between men's and women's jobs, and it's not because women's jobs got better.

Low pay, few benefits, insecurity and the decreasing number of working people who have any say over their employment through a union, have made the problems more urgent and universal.

Hillary used her power as First Lady to focus on work and working people. She'll use her power as President, with us backing her up, to do the same.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/Voices4Hillary/photos/a.1746239832263679.1073741827.1746239085597087/1757321337822195/?type=3,2016-06-29 14:00:00,38,4,33,36,2,0,0,0,0

What I really want is a health system, a choice system, that allows those with little means to have control over their own bodies just as much as those with means.  What I really want is for women to make their own choices for their own bodies, not Congress, not the Supreme Court, not the state legislatures, not my next-door neighbor.  Me.  Only Me.

Losing ain't easy Bernie fans, I know. My first losing presidential campaign as a paid employee was Mo Udall in 1976.  Like Sanders in 2016, Udall fought Jimmy Carter to the bitter end. And, it was bitter with an ongoing call by the Carter campaign for Mo to wrap it up and get out as Carter's victories mounted. For me, at 23, and fresh out of grad school, it was brutal. I loved Mo Udall.  I loved what he stood for and his vision for the future. He inspired me. I despised Jimmy Carter and his campaign.  

By the end when Mo conceded I was demolished. Bone tired from traveling for 9 months beginning in Iowa and finishing in California I felt a deep loss. We trudged on to the convention and played like there was still a campaign left, but it was skeletal and ghostly. I vowed that July that I would never vote for Carter.  Soon after the convention, many of us, advance people, were picked up by the Mondale campaign and a new journey began. 
I guess I went through Kubler-Ross' 5 stages of grief and by November, I voted for Carter and was proud to do so.  But it's hard to end a dream.  I feel your pain Sander's friends. I feel your bern.

1746239085597087_1757277581159904,"Voting My Conscience to Honor My Father
by Ariana Ornelas Smyth
My father recently told us that his mother was illiterate. I am embarrassed to admit that I was not aware of this. At the tender age of four, my father, who was raised on the Portuguese island of Madeira off the coast of Africa, was often sent to the village market to buy food and supplies. His mother, unable to write down a shopping list for my father to present to the grocer, made my father memorize the items to be purchased. Despite his best efforts to remember everything on the list, he inevitably would forget something. My father was easily distracted during the long walk to the market - the neighborhood dogs were much more vicious than the garden variety we have here in the US and, mostly, he was barefoot - and the beleaguered child had a solemn trek home, knowing that he would be sent back to fetch the missing item(s).
Today, my father has a Ph.D. and is a professor at a prestigious state university. He is far from illiterate and has overcome his legacy. He will be the first to tell you that when he immigrated to the US in the early sixties with his family when he was fifteen, he had no idea that he would one day be in the position that he is in. (Professors at public colleges are not the 1%, but they do have cultural and intellectual capital and live comfortably.) However, he did have a vision of upward mobility - one that was not unreasonable nor quixotic (for the time). It never occurred to him that he would be prohibited from enjoying such mobility because of his immigration status.
My father's story is not all that unique for a certain generation of immigrants, but today's politics have put that dream in jeopardy. (This has been made more evident by the Supreme Court's recent split decision, which blocked Obama's immigration plan to spare millions of immigrants from deportation).
Today, as I walked down a path adjacent to a construction site, I noticed that the 15 landscapers baking in the 90-degree heat were speaking Spanish to one another. One worker noticed the newborn strapped to my chest and smiled. I took this as an invitation and struck up a conversation asking about what they were building on the site (admittedly, this was motivated by my curiosity regarding recent development in the area. I live in Pittsburgh near East Liberty - a part of the city that is transitioning with the arrival of Google and other tech companies).
At one point in the conversation, I asked him the generic question posed to all foreign nationals - where are you from? He replied, ""Mexico."" It was a rather mundane query and the response was not at all surprising, but it left me with chills. At first, I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but as I walked away, it struck me. Here was a man, doing strenuous physical labor on a Saturday to make my neighborhood more beautiful, in a former Steel town built on the backs of immigrants - and he happened to be from Mexico - yes, the country that will be separated from the US by a wall (to, in Trump's words, keep out the ""criminals"" and ""rapists"") should Trump become our next president. This wall - this impenetrable barrier of hate and intolerance - did not exist for my father.
It was enough to remind me, yet again, of why Trump - a man committed to rolling back many of the advances in constitutional jurisprudence and civil rights should we permit him - is so dangerous and why we must do everything humanly possible to defeat him. It also occurred to me that in all probability my father would not be permitted to enter this country legally if he were fifteen today and he too might face deportation like many unauthorized immigrants in the US were he to remain without a path to citizenship at his disposal.
Obama's executive action would have deferred deportation for DREAMers and for those unauthorized immigrants who are also parents to citizens or legal residents (as a means to keep families together). Yet this limited opportunity, like so many others, was recently quashed by the Supreme Court - hopes crushed under the weight of a divided ideology. A Trump presidency will only further divide Americans. There is only one indelible truth here - we are a country of immigrants. Hillary recognizes this and she has continued to support Obama's initiatives and has vowed to lobby for comprehensive reforms. She understands that there cannot be meaningful reform without citizenship. For Hillary, protecting our borders is not the same as closing the doors to the many immigrants that have enriched American society and boosted our influence in the world.
Over the course of the Primary, dogmatic Sanders supporters who have embraced the ""Bernie or Bust"" sentiment have invoked the ""I must vote my conscience"" defense as a justification for potentially not voting for Hillary in November, even as they acknowledge that a vote for a third party candidate or for no candidate at all in the general election is constructively a vote for Trump. But now that Hillary and Trump are the presumptive nominees, the only option left for these folks is ""Hillary or Trump."" I hope they don't really prefer Trump - a huge Bust for the nation, the world, and Bernie's principles - over Hillary.
As I recall staring into the eyes of the Mexican landscaper today, I think of my father, and of the figurative bridge to the US that rescued him from poverty. I think of the jingoism and nativism spreading like wildfire across the US and Europe that threaten to destroy these bridges between nations and harkens back to an epoch of world politics better left in the past. And I think that in this presidential election, I too will vote my conscience, to honor my father, for Hillary.

The 2016 Presidential Election and LGBT Americans

By New York State Assemblymember Deborah Glick

The election of a new president to succeed Barack Obama could not be a more important race for LGBT Americans. President Obama has been a great friend to the LGBT community, including the most recent designation of the Christopher Street Park as a National Monument celebrating the history of the LGBT movement and our fight for equality. But we have an opportunity to support as good a friend, if not better, in Hillary Clinton.

In 2000, Hillary Clinton became the first woman elected to represent New York in the United States Senate. Throughout her tenure as a Senator, she worked hard for all New York families, including non-traditional families. Hillary supported the right of LGBT New Yorkers to adopt children on a equal basis as their straight neighbors. When Hillary was running for US Senate, our fight to pass bias-related crime legislation in New York State was stalled in the Republican-controlled State Senate. Hillary came to Albany, spoke out forcefully on the issue and then added her voice to our struggle. As a result, the bill passed and LGBT New Yorkers got greater protection in bias attacks.

The community is also concerned about economic equality for all. Throughout her career, Hillary has been a strong advocate for equal pay for equal work, paid family leave and the right of women to control their own health care decisions. As First Lady in 1995, she attended the Women's Conference in Beijing, and declared women's rights were human rights. This speech marked a turning point in the international discussion of women's rights. Then in 2011, as Secretary of State, to mark International Human Rights Day, Secretary Clinton gave a speech in Geneva reviewing the history of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During that stirring address she proclaimed that gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights. Hillary Clinton has always stood up for the dignity of all people regardless of their race, religion, economic status, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. Hillary Clinton has supported an outright ban on conversion therapy, a discredited practice that attempts to change the sexual orientation of LGBT people. Hillary Clinton has supported gun control, and when Bill Clinton was President we had a ban on assault weapons. Had that ban remained in place, 49 of our brothers and sisters may have been saved from the outrageous massacre in Orlando. Hillary Clinton and her compassionate message to the families of those killed or injured was in stark contrast to those on the right who gave vague mention to thoughts and prayers when their actions have been only to hurt our community.

On this Pride Sunday, as we remember those who died in Orlando, or anywhere else from the homophobia that infects our society, remember we have the power with our votes to make the difference in November. Our strength as a country has been based on our diversity and Hillary Clinton has always championed that diversity.

1746239085597087_1756465647907764,"Taking Down All the Stuff that's Holding Trump Up, by John Sedgwick

This whole Brexit thing is terrifying--as it least it is today and who knows about next week—for it seems now that powerful subterranean (and transatlantic) forces are pushing Trump as much as he is pulling them.  He is just a figurehead, not really The Man, so all this talk of him being a fraud and con man is irrelevant. 

The real story of this election is not Trump, but his many true believers.  If Brexit, for all its economic hazards, has over half of Britain, its American equivalent  may well have that much here, right?  Which means that we of the smug chattering class, lately so dismissive of Trump for countless excellent reasons, may be handed our comeuppance, too.  

We can call Trump ignorant, loutish, deluded, fraudulent, etc. etc., and therefore his fans of limited number.  But Britain shows no.  People are seriously pissed!  This is not the age of Enlightenment, let's face it, so there is no telling what they'll do.  

Right now, I'd say Hillary has her work cut out for her if she is to persuade a majority to stay the course and not chuck out all the Muslims, abolish taxes, and nuke ISIS.  It's not about taking Trump down, but about taking down all the stuff that is holding him up, and that is going to be much harder.

First of all: ugh.

You have to love this headline: The British Are Frantically Googling What The E.U. Is, Hours After Voting To Leave It.

So maybe, once they see what they've done, there will be another, better informed referendum, overturning the first.

But maybe not.

So . . . ugh.

As a 27-year-old British friend texted this morning (bleeped to protect your sensibilities):

""I'm livid.  The vote was carried by a load of baby boomers who are secure in their pensions and it doesn't really matter a flying f— to, other than they want to regain nostalgic feelings of 50-year-ago Briton viewed thru rose-tinted backwards looking spectacles.

""There were so little facts in this referendum, it's invalid. Democracy only works if the electorate can make an informed decision on their best interests based on the facts.  If they're fed a load of crap and vote as a result, it's not democracy, it's fraud!

""Never again will I hold a slightly smug sense of superiority when we talk about American partisan politics. Turns out we're all f --d.  Led by the lowest common denominator and peddled to with misinformation and barefaced lies and controlled by an unaccountable media.

""I think I've aged a decade this morning and firmly arrived as a grumpy, cynical man.

""I watched a ""leave"" voter on the BBC this morning say she thought it was outrageous that Scotland were calling for another independence referendum and that this was a time for unity!!"" 

Turning to America, Texas Governor George W. Bush proclaimed, preposterously, that ""by far the vast majority"" of his proposed tax cuts would go to people ""at the bottom of the economic ladder"" and promised ""a humble foreign policy"" even as he was planning to invade Iraq.  It's hard to overstate how much harm his presidency did. But the second time, he even got a majority of the vote — with 70% of his voters believing, erroneously, that Iraq had played a role in the 9/11 attack.

And now Trump is promising ridiculous things — he's going to bring millions of $1-an-hour jobs back from China?  And somehow make their employers pay a good wage even though he opposes the minimum wage?  And force consumers around the world to buy products made here with $20-an-hour labor instead of the same products made in China with $1-an-hour labor? Even though, as a businessman, he sources his own products from overseas?  And this is all just going to magically happen because he'll bring back torture and defeat ISIS in a matter of weeks and is the king of debt and will build a beautiful wall?

Trump's main focus will be destroying his opponent.  He will say anything that pops into his head — or even say outrageous things in prepared remarks.  (E.g., she was ""sleeping"" during the Benghazi crisis.  Challenged for proof, he explained to NBC News' Lester Holt that she might have been sleeping — ""how do you know she wasn't?"" — and that was, to his mind, basis enough for the charge.)

1746239085597087_1755972334623762,"She did it. Wednesday, Hillary Clinton delivered a speech that actually made me feel excited about her economic vision.

By Rana Foroohar, Asst Managing Editor at TIME

It wasn't so much that she gave us ideas we hadn't heard before. Things like a big infrastructure build, affordable childcare, equal pay, and worker training have always been part of Clinton's plan. It was more about the energy she brought to the speech, (in sharp contrast with Tuesday's yawner) and the way in which she connected the dots.

Here are the five things Clinton talked about, which, if delivered on, could be most impactful in creating a more robust, sustainable, shared economic recovery.

First, raising incomes is the only way forward in a 70% consumption economy. As Clinton said, you can't have a sustainable recovery in a country in which consumer spending is two-thirds of the pie when people haven't gotten a raise in real terms since the early 1990s. Clinton presented a multi-pronged view on how to do this, from strengthening unions to backing portable benefits to making sure that scheduling software doesn't wreak havoc with people's lives. It's smart to get in front of these sharing economy challenges, which will only grow more pressing for more people in the coming years.
Second, you have to curb short-term thinking in corporate America to help companies make the investments they need for the long haul. Here, Clinton touched yet again on the contentious issues of share buybacks, which grew in part because of changes made during her husband's administration. If she can fix this problem by curbing buybacks, she'll be doing something that's not only good for America, but for the Clinton legacy.
Third, expand Social Security – it's the only part of the retirement system that's working well right now. It's the reason we didn't have vastly higher numbers of older people falling into poverty during the Great Recession. Particularly in an era in which asset returns are likely to be lower (and thus 401(k)s not as fat), it makes huge economic sense to expand this safety net.
Fourth, make corporations and rich individuals pay their fare share of taxes. Clinton made it clear that if she gets her way, carried interest is on its way out, companies would be penalized for tax inversions, and tax optimization loopholes would be closed. That's important not only because of the revenue it could raise, but also because we need to close the divide between Main Street and Wall Street in order to curb the populism that has created this ugly election cycle.
Finally, connect the dots between race, class and economic opportunity. By talking about things like immigration reform and the fact that the unemployment rate for African Americans is still double what it is for whites in our ""recovery,"" Clinton underscored that race, class, and economic sustainability issues are very much interconnected. I think that making that connection — and also underscoring the fact that structural shifts in the economy make it almost certain that more people will face the same challenges that immigrants and minorities have faced for years (stagnant wages, no safety net, less secure employment) unless something changes, she starts to move the Democratic Party away from divisive, 1990s-style identity politics and towards more economic unity. That is, to my mind, the first step in a bigger, deeper, broader labor movement that could move the needle on the wealth share for workers.

""Don't grow weary – there are great ideas out there,"" said Clinton during her speech. Today, I believed her. More of this, please.

This Is Our Moment

By Roxana Robinson 

There are moments in the life of a nation when we are all present. Just as we all know the moment in which Abraham Lincoln spoke about our divided country, delivering a message of love and community; just as we know of Martin Luther King's speech, in which he delivered his own dream of a nation undivided by race; just as we know the moment in which John Kennedy said he was a Berliner, and the great speech President Obama delivered on religion, and on his election.  These are moments in which our hearts swell.  Hearing these words we remember what it is we love about our country.  We are reminded of our common humanity. 

Today, watching the great John Lewis walk to the podium on the floor of the House, hearing him say that the time has come, hearing him say that we have lost too many sons, brothers, sisters, children, and hearing him say that it is time to act, is one of those moments. Watching other members, during his speech, rise silently and walk to join him at his place, watching them nod in agreement with his words, and listening to the way Americans can rise up and speak truth to power, watching the way great men and women will stand firm against a monolith that has corroded the very essence of our culture, a monolith that has eaten into the democratic process, deformed our mortality rates, empowered our madmen and silenced our representatives. The NRA and those Republicans in its thrall have been publicly shamed. This is a moment when our brave, brave Congress men and women have stood up to be counted. 

Let this courageous movement spread like the dawn across our beautiful, spacious, peaceful nation.

I've discovered that even in Africa, you can't escape Donald Trump.  Arriving at Kilimanjaro Airport, my cab driver asked somewhat meekly, ""What's going on in America?"" Of course, you think, he has to be asking about the tragedy in Orlando?  But no. The follow up question is about the reality of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for President.  Okay, I think, one person's question is, just one person's question, after all, you're far away in Africa. But no. Soon, everywhere you go, you are engulfed with questions about America's presidential campaign and the impact of Donald Trump. From the bellhop to the bartender, the sales clerk at the curio and crafts shop to the waiter at the restaurant, they are all wondering, what is happening in America? 

I know ""the Donald"" would be pleased that he's the topic of conversation even far into the African bush, but I am embarrassed.  His magical mystery tour of idiocy has permeated the world.  The Africans I meet are concerned. If Trump achieves the presidency, they wonder, what impact he would have upon the world with his simple ideas and narrow perspectives?  Here in Africa, you sense a great love for America.  But there is a bewilderment.  They wonder, I think, if America's political system can be so unstable to produce a person of such limits, what hope does that give to the rest of us?

1746239085597087_1754353408118988,"The Birth of Gun Culture

By Roxana Robinson

 

A friend recently asked Roxana Robinson, an American writer and gun- control advocate, how society evolved to our current culture of guns.

""As I understand it, it's a strange two-tiered construct.  The Founders wanted to be sure that we would have a standing army to fight off possible attackers.   So the Constitution contains that strange provision that may simply mean we can have a standing army, which of course we do.

The gun culture didn't become so deeply entrenched until Reconstruction, when the South became angry and resentful of the Union troops who occupied Southern territory, specifically South Carolina, Mississippi and Georgia.  At the same time, some states founded black militias in order to ensure that freedmen were allowed the rights they been granted by the Civil War. 

In response to Union troops and armed black militias, white men formed private organizations, including the Sweetwater Saber Club in Edgefield, South Carolina.  These were the first gun clubs, formed with the goal of creating a powerful, armed presence that would intimidate the freedmen.  That was the moment guns became a psychological part of libertarian claims for the individual, white citizen. This wave of anger and resentment, along with the sense of fierce entitlement has never abated.  Instead it has become part of a uniquely American sense of personal liberty. 

That said, a huge proportion of Americans, including responsible gun-owners, want stricter gun control laws. This widespread political inclination has foundered against the looming presence of the NRA, one of the most powerful lobbying organizations in the nation. Today, we are all caught in its horrifying and monstrous tangle, which is well funded by the largest weapons industry in the world. 

With each gun massacre, we take stock. This again is one of the moments in which we look at the path we've taken and wonder, how we could have erred so badly? How we could have interpreted something so sane and sensible in such a wildly irrational manner?The Founders simply needed a volunteer force, a National Guard, intended to protect the safety of all our citizens. How can we allow such a brave, thoughtful and hopeful intention to have become a violent, and uncontrollable aspect of our society, one that daily poses the risk of death to every man, woman and child in the country?""

1746239085597087_1753699424851053,"Power to Equal Pay by Eve Ellis
 
This past Tuesday, at the White House-convened United State of Women Summit, I was on energy overload. It was a day of inspiring speeches by on-the- ground trailblazers and the thrilling moment when President Obama called himself a feminist. Yet for me, the most exciting, kick-off news was this: The White House made visible its ""Equal Pay Pledge"".
 
By signing the Pledge, companies commit to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations; reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers; and embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives. Companies pledge to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. Research shows that white women earn 79 cents to every white man's dollar, Hispanic women earn just 54 cents, and African American women earn 63 cents.
 
28 companies, many household names, so far have signed on to The Pledge. Yes, government has, in two words, stepped up. Power has now been brought to the problem.
 
My bet is that the Equal Pay Pledge will have more widespread success than the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. 
 
Why? Because the Pledge taps into the competitiveness of CEOs.  They will want to belong to a group that is publicly known for doing what is right.  The same happened when the Giving Pledge provided similar opportunity for the ultra-wealthy.
 
I am reminded of why the 30% Club, started by the dynamic leader, Helena Morrissey, in England (and now with a strong presence in the US as well) succeeded there, accelerating female representation on public company boards.
 
In 2010, Morrissey used the same strategy. She enlisted the support of Lord Mervyn Davies, a leader of the British House of Lords, to persuade CEOs, that competitive breed, to join a prestigious, public group by declaring to add women to their boards.   Power was brought to the problem. Then there was action. ""Yes, our company commits in public to make a positive change"".
 
The Equal Pay Pledge relies on power addressing the problem too,  - Presidential power and then CEO power. 
 
CEOs are signing on (Here's the link:
https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/06/14/businesses-taking-equal-pay-pledge).  They review compensation of employees with like-jobs. When they discover discrepancies, they remedy, some even overnight.  Other CEOs, the fortunate or the forward-looking ones, find no gender pay gap...to the penny.  CEOs are using their power.  More and more will sign on. The US government is on our side, using its power to urge action and create a fairer America.
 
We can spread the word and ask companies where we work ,or in which we invest, to take the Equal Pay Pledge. We can support our 44th President in this effort and soon our 45th.
 
The Equal Pay Pledge, with its appeal to the pride, competitiveness as well as decency of individual CEOs will ignite more companies, especially if we all demand this, to achieve the simple goal which has so far eluded other legislation: equal pay.  I am optimistic.

""I'm endorsing Hillary Clinton for President because she is the champion Nevadans need fighting for us in the White House. Hillary is committed to ensuring middle class families are able to get ahead and stay ahead. She knows that we cannot sustain an economy where people at the top continue to prosper while wages for working families continue to flatline. And while too many in Washington are focused on ideological battles to defund Planned Parenthood, Hillary will focus on what Nevadans want: comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage, ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work, and preserving a woman's access to basic, affordable – and at times life-saving – health care.

""When she launched her candidacy for President, Hillary came to Nevada and immediately focused on comprehensive immigration reform – highlighting an issue that is a centerpiece of her campaign – and an issue that is deeply personal for me. My grandfather emigrated here from Chihuahua, Mexico, and because of his hard work – and the hard work of my parents – my sister and I were the first in our family to graduate from college. Everyone should have that opportunity to succeed – here in Nevada and across the country.

""In the Senate, I hope to work with President Hillary Clinton and members of both Parties to solve problems like a broken immigration system, paycheck discrimination, and stagnant wages. In contrast, my opponent, Congressman Heck, is part of the problem in Washington.  Congressman Heck opposes comprehensive immigration reform, opposes a woman's right to choose, voted multiple times to defund Planned Parenthood, and voted three times against ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work. I'm running for Senate to solve problems, and I'm endorsing Hillary Clinton because unlike many Republicans in Washington, she is committed to solving the challenges Nevada families face.""

But if you want to feel optimistic about the future, there's nothing like teaching adolescents.  My sister-in-law's mother once told me that what makes adolescents great is that they have an incredibly strong sense of justice.  They are also honest and authentic in a way that requires the adults around them to hold themselves to higher standards.  A few weeks ago I asked one of my students, ""Please don't say 'shut up.'"" One of her classmates asked me, ""Who made you the arbiter of our discourse?""  

Although it was some consolation that both the words 'arbiter' and 'discourse' were vocabulary from class, I still struggled to answer.  Finally I came up with, ""I just think that the phrase 'shut up' is more about silencing than promoting discourse.""

Terrorism, of course, aims to shut down discourse, silence dissenting voices.  Education, at its best, impresses on people the urgency of hearing every voice among us.  Not heeding, necessarily, but hearing.  

So when a young person questions the right of an adult—or anyone—to censor their language, I feel happy and hopeful about the future of civic discourse. The next generation of voters is going to ask its leaders challenging questions and is not going to settle for easy answers.  

There's a story floating around about a young person who asks a wise elder what to do about dueling urges, saying, ""It's like there are two wolves inside me, one good and one evil. Which one is going to win?""

And the elder answers, ""The one you feed.""  

I don't believe in evil. Maybe, as a teacher, I can't.  A lot of the actions characterized as evil seem to me to be driven by things our culture feeds: illness, fear, loneliness, exhaustion, injustice, deprivation, isolation, self-hatred, indifference to and disregard for others, and ignorance in so many forms.

Hillary has been fighting to give everyone a healthy start, medical care, safe communities and a better educated and more deeply interconnected country and world for decades. 

Let's feed that.

By Dennis Sullivan

If there is one thought that has threaded through television coverage of this campaign, it's that these are the least popular presidential candidates in history. Some pundits say that it comes down to a choice between the lesser of two evils, but this is another example of false equivalence where Hillary Clinton's accomplishments are downplayed. The fact is Hillary deserves higher levels of popularity and Donald Trump seems to be heading for truly unheard of levels of abhorrence. 

Not that popularity is a static measure by any means. Harry Truman lost 60 points on that scale during his presidency. More currently, President Obama's numbers have soared in the latter part of his tenure. 

But let's look at this notion that Hillary Clinton is unpopular because she's dishonest and untrustworthy. This question so infects every poll that I might be tempted to answer it in the affirmative myself, just to be one of the crowd. And after all, every politician is nowadays seen to be somewhere between incompetent and corrupt. Congress comes in at 11 percent. By some standards, Hillary is Miss Congeniality. 

(The emails. I'll leave that to another post. For now I'll just say that while there is no evidence that Secretary Clinton's computer was ever hacked, the State Department's computer was repeatedly breached, presumably by the Russians). 

I think I can support this comment: I am not aware of Hillary Clinton ever having lied nor have I ever known her to betray anyone's trust. I predict confidently that by November the polls will agree and, of course, so will the voters.

1746239085597087_1752436798310649,"What Is A Primary?
By Deborah Sale, who worked on the McGovern Fraser Commission in 1968

(Editor's note: There has been some confusion in this election year as to the function of a primary. Some have complained that the process is not democratic and not open to all who want to vote.  Deborah Sale has been active in Democratic politics since her Uncle Fred ran for Circuit Court when she was 4. Her first Presidential campaign was 1972 and she later served in the Carter-Mondale White House, the Executive Chamber of Governor Mario Cuomo and the Clinton Gore Transition team. Most important for this subject, Deborah was a volunteer staff member of the McGovern-Fraser Commission established 1968 to create a more inclusive Democratic nominating process for the Presidency.)

First: A primary is not a general election. 
The primary, in our two party system, is a process established by the Democratic and Republican Parties to assist the Parties in choosing their nominees for the general election.  
The primary system is fairly new to our democracy. In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was chosen at the Republican Convention in Chicago by delegations of party leaders from each state.  It took a mere 233 votes---a 2/3 majority of the delegates to gain the nomination.
In the 20th Century, a few state parties determined to hold primaries to give guidance to their delegations to the Democratic Conventions.  But the power at these conventions was held by the Party leaders and elected officials of each state. These were the conventions which choose Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John Kennedy in the ""smoke filled rooms"" where Democratic Party leaders met to make their decisions. 
After the divided 1968 Convention,  the Democratic Party determined to broaden participation and bring more diversity into their process.  A Commission was established under the leadership of Senator George McGovern and Representative Donald Fraser to bring more uniformity to the delegate selection process and give greater influence to women, minorities and young people.  Their recommendations gave rise to the current primary system.  That system continued to include Democratic elected officials and party leaders as delegates, but it added a greater number of delegates elected by popular vote in Party primaries.  There was a widespread assumption that these primaries would be open only to members of the Democratic Party in each state, as the function is to choose the Party's nominee. However, close to 2/3 of the states allow cross-over voting----permitting voters not registered as Democrats to vote.  The current cry for open primaries assumes this should be universal.  There are legitimate arguments for voter registration reform, but is it too much to ask that those who want to have a say in electing the Democratic nominee for President register as Democrats? At the very least, this helps defeat attempts by non-Democrats who want to undermine a strong nominating process.

1746239085597087_1752249401662722,"Let the Real Hillary Be Known

This is Part 2 of Blogging for Hillary's interview with Gerry Laybourne, one of television's most powerful women, about being a Democrat and supporting Hillary.  After serving as President of Disney/ABC cable networks, she left to found the women's programming network, Oxygen Media.

When did you first meet Hillary?
I met Hillary in the early 1990's when she was in the White House.  The first conference that I attended was on Zero to Three.  Hillary brought research scientists, neurologists, child development experts to the White House.  Rob Reiner was involved and its premise was that kids brains are at their most plastic form between zero and three.  And if you don't get kids engaged in curiosity and learning and if they aren't encouraged during that period in their lives, it's very hard to ever catch up. That was Hillary's conference and it was spectacular. The next time was in 1996.  There was a conference on children's television.  Mr. Rogers was there.  She's always been at the heart of issues that are terribly important to me.  Issues about kids, early childhood education, and the importance of us taking children seriously and putting them at the top of the list.  
 
You have said that everyone should listen to the Commencement Address she gave when she graduated from Wellesley.  How do you think she compares now with who she was then?

I have this theory that I have confirmed with a number of people.  It is that we are our most inventive selves when we're in our 20's and 30's, and most of us develop who we're going to be and then spend the rest of our lives enacting it.  That was certainly true of me - and a lot of other people that I know.  When Hillary went to Wellesley in the 1960's, there was a lot of unrest on campus.  In Wellesley governance, there wasn't much room for students.  The students had complaints with the required course curriculum.  Hillary was a student leader and she helped organize the students in a very respectful, effective way.  They had a reasonable approach to the administration, they instituted changes, and one of the first changes was the fact that a student got to give the address at Commencement and Hillary was unanimously elected.  Then she actually developed her speech with her entire class.  She has always been true to representative government and her constituents. And with absolutely no notes, her speech was all about human rights, respect for others, caring about the world.  Who is is and who she became is in that speech.
 
Why do you think so many people believe she is not truly genuine when she stands for the same big political issues now that she stood for then?
I don't think most people really know her roots.  I think she's been under the microscope for 25 years and there's been a lot of bad front page news about Whitewater and President Clinton's issues, and I think people just don't see past it.  
 
Or is it that she's a woman?
My favorite Linda Ellerbee quote is ""You will know when women have really made it when there is a truly mediocre woman at the head of a company.""  Because the truth is that the only hope for women in business is that they are high performers.  If they don't perform, they're not going to make it on their charm.  Hillary has proven, job after job, that she was tremendously effective as a Senator, tremendously effective as Secretary of State.  When she was Secretary of State, her approval ratings were incredibly high.  Partly because she was out in the world, she was serving President Obama, she wasn't going for the top job.  When women go for the top job, that's when they truly get whacked.  I think we as a society will get over this but part of getting over this is actually having a woman president.  Honestly, I have gone back in history to see if we had any candidate ever running for the presidency of the United States who was more qualified, and I can't find anyone.  The only one I think was more qualified was George Washington and that's because he invented the job.  And that's it.  Hillary will be the next President of the United States.  And that is something that will change our society in a very positive way, and it will mean that my granddaughters don't have to be as perfect and they won't have to struggle as hard and frankly it will be a better world for my grandsons as well.
 
What do you tell your grandchildren about the importance of this election?
I talk to all four of them.  They are 5, almost 7,9, and almost 13.  And all 4 of them are Hillary supporters, and I talk with them about what Hillary cares about.  That she cares about  education.  That she cares about prison reform.  That she cares about putting people back to work.  And they get it.  They have a lot of strong women in their family.  My siblings.  Myself.  My daughter and daughter in law.  There are a lot of strong women role models in my family doing good in the world.  I interviewed my five year old granddaughter Lulu, and I said what do you think about a woman being president? She said I am going to be the second woman president.  (You know when you're five, it's really all about you.)  I said who are you supporting now.  She said Hillary.  I said why are you supporting Hillary.  She said because she's smart, confident and helpful.  And that's pretty good for a five year old. (could add video link to the video of Lulu)

What would you your great-grandchildren to know about this time in America's history and your role in it?
I would like to tell them that I did everything I could to figure out a way to let the Hillary I know come forth to everybody else.  There's a story I need to tell you about the early days of her being a Senator.  I was asked by the cable TV industry to lobby her on the issue of the bundle, which is that when we pay for basic cable TV channels like ESPN and Nickelodeon are packaged in that same bundle.  Judith McHale and I went to Senate Dining room for lunch and we talked with Hillary for a good hour.  But she was interrupted by every single person in the room.   Every Republican wanted her to meet their guests.  Every Democrat wanted to her to meet their guests.  Every waiter - everybody - wanted to shake her hand. And we're giving our reasons why this is a great economic model for the cable TV industry and I expected at the end of the lunch for her to say thanks for coming.  And she didn't.  She said something like…""I've been listening to you and you have a real problem and I am trying to figure out how I can help you and I think the only way I can help you is to tell you the truth.  My constituents are angry at their cable company.  They don't like paying for ESPN when they don't watch it.  And they don't like having X rated content come into their homes.  And until the cable operators deal with that, they're going to have problems.""  Just think about how prescient that was and the kind of issues that cable operators are facing today with the ever increasing cost of programming.  For me, that meant if she is going to stand up to us, two of her big supporters, then she will stand up to anybody.  That really said a lot.  It was an indication to me of how her brain works.  She doesn't accept lobbying. She'll listen.  But she's always a problem solver.  I want my great-grandchildren to know that we got a problem solver in there who broke through this crazy do-nothing Washington that had been facing us for at least the last ten years.
 
Why do you think that side of Hillary doesn't come across very well?
I think that deep down, people know she knows how to get stuff done.  She just doesn't come across in a soundbite way.  I believe that we're in this altogether, and unless the United States of America wakes up and does what they can - and this is what I want to tell my great-grandchildren -  it's that you have to care.  You have to participate.  You have to do whatever you can to make this world a better place. There's only one reason we're on this planet and that's to bring on the next generation.  To me, Hillary has been about that from day one, and she's going to go out that way.  The message is not to leave it on her lap alone.  We all have a lot to do.  We have a lot of pressure to put on our Congresspeople.  We want stuff to be fixed in this country.  We don't want bridges falling down.  We don't want people living in poverty.  We don't want hard working Americans to not have a living wage.  It's not right.  And it's fixable.

A friend of mine, a highly rational human being, calmed me down some weeks ago. Like Hillary, I had done the math and had put Sanders behind me. But now, I saw only Trump-- a racist, misogynist, xenophobic demagogue, flooding the airwaves, filling all the print columns, bullying and ranting, bullying and ranting—shouting fire, a menace outside all ordinary standards of decency. I saw only Trump, threatening Hillary and destroying the America I love.

""Breathe"", said my friend. He explained, ""Trump will lose. The people who support
Trump already support Trump. The majority of Americans are disgusted by his racism and buffoonery, including in the crucial battleground states.  Do the math"".

I did. And so was born Annette's Theory of How Hillary Wins Big on November 8.

I call it the Moat Theory of the Election of 2016. Donald Trump lives in Trump Castle surrounded by a moat filled with alligators and other dangerous creatures of his own making.

We simply quote Trump's dangerous words, old and new, and distribute them broadly. Those are the alligators. No one new wants in to his Castle. The shame is too great; the dangers too real and the lies too numerous. 

Those inside the castle know the alligators well, having fed them for some time, so they can navigate their way out if they want to swim out. 

That's half the Moat Theory of the Election of 2016. The rest is also easy. We make sure people outside Trump Castle know about Hillary—the qualifications of Hillary, the simple human decency of Hillary, the intelligence of
Hillary, the sane, thoughtfulness of Hillary—and millions vote for her and help Get Out the Vote.

The information and love we disseminate about Hillary plants seeds for lovely gardens in which we thrive...those of us outside the Moat.

That then is Annette's Theory of How Hillary Wins Big on November 8.

""Government, the only means we have of ensuring that every citizen has the same rights and benefits of every other and any other citizen, none above the rest""

By Edward M. Shain

The elections of 2016, whether primary or for office, are about

whether government is part of the solution or part of the

problem, the most elemental question we can ask about one's

country. Yet the perfectibility of government as an idea is at the

heart of the American Experiment. When George Washington

famously said, ""Let us raise a standard to which the wise and

honest can repair; the rest is in the hands of God"", he was

referring to government as a necessary instrument of man,

improvable by wisdom and accumulated knowledge.

When Lincoln closed The Gettysburg Address with these famous

words, ""It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task

remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take

increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full

measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these

dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God,

shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the

people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the

Earth"",  he was speaking of government, the only means we have

of ensuring that every citizen has the same rights and benefits of

every other and any other citizen, none above the rest, and all

inclusive.

When Emma Lazarus wrote her poem The New Colossus, now

situated at the base of The Statue of Liberty, she made manifest

what Washington and Lincoln's blood-sanctified words had said

earlier:

""Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand

A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame

Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name

Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand

Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command

The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

""Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!"" cries she

With silent lips. ""Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""

Lazurus' ""Golden Door"" isn't merely the amber waves of grain.

It's government constructed to Washington's exalted metric, an

instrument of purpose for embracing, nourishing and succoring

every citizen of this fortunate land. When she rebukes ""Keep,

ancient lands, your storied pomp"" and then commands ""give me

your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe

Free"",  she is referencing the men who died consecrating the fields

so Lincoln's imperative of a government of, by and for the people

might obtain.

When we square against it, it isn't immigration that's the enemy,

or economic inequality, or paying fewer taxes, or people getting

""a free ride."" It's not whether health care is too expensive or

whether entitlements are killing us. It's the idea that government

is anything other than an institution for all citizens rewarding

none at the expense of others, and treating all equally under the

law.

Only Hillary Clinton matches up against that simple but ruthless

standard. Donald Trump, a walking avatar for privilege, suggests

one self-contradicting absurdity after another, each one

illuminating his sense of entitlement. The measure of our

national crisis is that such an obvious distinction seems lost to too

many Americans. These citizens, undone by decades of

deteriorating government, have been misled into voting for ideas that enshrine privilege rather

than remove it.

If we are to once again open the ""The Golden Door"" to all, we

first must elect a government that heeds Washington's ancient

call to ""raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair.""

Only Clinton has the intelligence, the competence, and the

political skill to pry open that door, now closed because of

Republican intransigence, privilege and open racism.

Why are you a Democrat?

Ironically, on both sides of my family, my mother's mother was the  head of the Republican Party in North Dakota, and my father's father was a Brooklyn Congressman – I think the only Republican ever elected out of Brooklyn in the 1920's. My parents grew up amidst Republican values and then began to question them in the 1950's.  My mother became a very big Democrat.  We were the only Democrats in a Republican neighborhood so I was the only kid supporting Adlai Stevenson.  It was a values lesson in our family.  We learned what it was to be a Democrat.  Being a Democrat was caring about everybody.  Being a Democrat was caring about schools. Being a Democrat was about paying our fair share of taxes.  Being a Democrat was about Civil Rights.

How did that differ from Republicans?
Honestly in those days I do not remember such a big difference as today.  We were all about rebuilding America and our economy.  Republicans were more concerned about keeping taxes low and building up the military.

What was your first Presidential Campaign?
Adlai Stevenson.  I was tormented.  Kids would write in the dust on our bumper ""I Like Ike."" They would put ""I Like Ike"" stickers on my books.  I was 8 years old.  But I stood up.  I've been a fighting Democrat since I was 8.
 
Talk a little about your family.
I have two sisters and a brother.  But I have 27 cousins who are mostly Republicans.
 
How does that work?
You know, we all love each other.  We're all look alike especially my cousin Lisa and I. Our values are so close but she was raised a Republican and I was raised a Democrat. Our differences are probably closer to  the world we grew up in than the world we inhabit.

Your values are similar but you are basically on opposite sides of the political spectrum? Lisa Likely will vote for Hillary because values have been breached in this election. When it comes down to basic human dignity, I think there is going to be a lot of crossing over. I think you see it on both sides. 

I think the media and especially social media are primary villains in this story.  And I hope we can turn social media around to being a hero.  Social media makes it very easy for people to be snide and snarky and let out deep feelings they may have about thinks like: How come women get to do these things?  Am I going to get a job if women are going to get my jobs?   There's some very basic negative things coming out in our society and my orientation has always been: Let's lift everybody up.  That has always been the central message of Hillary. Let's figure out how we fix education.  Let's figure out how people get to college who have never had access to college.  Let's deal with income inequality. I am more committed than ever to get more involved in prison reform because I see it.  I see what it's done to our country.  We've turned prisons into a big businesses.  Now, I have been a big business woman, but always with values.  I was lucky enough to work on things like Nickelodeon where if you didn't have values, you had no business being there.  But when we go pure business and pure profit, we miss out on everything this country is about and we end up in the state we're in right now.  If people had the community orientation to build a society where our infrastructure works and there's a chance for everyone to be in the middle class, we would be a different country.
 
Do you see this election as hope versus fear?

It is definitely that.  I think reality television has had an impact.  I think there is no way Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee if it hadn't been for The Apprentice. I've always been afraid of reality TV because of what it take people to people's to the lowest common denominator very quickly.  I think that people look at it from a sense of ""Well, at least I'm not that bad!"" But then you have the consequence of somebody like Donald Trump, who really hasn't been a business success – except for reality TV.  When you read the front page of a newspaper, you're not reading hopeful articles.  You're reading about what's falling apart.  What's not happening.  But I am an optimist.  Maybe that's why I'm a Democrat.  I wake up thinking that everything is possible.  And I feel so much better when I'm working for the greater good than when I'm just working for the almighty dollar.
 
You were responsible for Linda Ellerbee doing Nick News on Nickelodeon. She spoke to kids in a very positive way.  What impact do you think that had on those children today?  

It's funny that you mention this because when Linda and I talked about starting Nick News, I said to her my goal is to raise up better candidates. That was the underlying purpose of Nick News.  We were training these kids to be engaged in the world, to want to be involved in the world, to want to be good citizens, and frankly to run for office. Nick News just celebrated its 25th Anniversary.  We haven't yet hit that age when a kid running for President would have been old enough to have been impacted by Nick News. But one of the things that was so exciting for me about Nick News is that it put everything into context.   We weren't breaking news.  We tried to explain the news.  We put it into a story.  We made it emotional.  We helped kids learn to care about things.  Like when we covered AIDS with Magic Johnson.  Unfortunately, Nick News was cancelled this year.

1746239085597087_1751749468379382,"These important insights on Hillary's Commitment to Human Rights are by Michael Posner, former Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Democracy and Labor, now a Professor at NYU Stern School of Business and co-Director of the Center for Business and Human Rights.

Clinton's Commitment, Tenacity and Smart Diplomacy Enabled Real Progress in Human Rights.

Last week in San Diego Hillary Clinton urged Americans to remain ""true to our values.""  She stressed,  ""We never, ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place,"" a theme she has sounded often throughout her campaign.  Some will dismiss this as campaign-generated rhetoric. In fact it's a commitment that is central to who she is as a person and what has motivated her decades of public service.  I say this with great confidence because I had a front row seat during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.
  
 From 2009 until 2013 I served as the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Democracy and Labor, her point person on issues where America's values are tested every day.  She recruited me to come to the State Department after I had spent more than three decades as a human rights advocate outside of government, including as long-time director of Human Rights First.  I came into government believing that other U.S. interests – political, economic and security – often would trump our commitments to human rights.  I also had been warned that even getting the attention of senior policy-makers on human rights and democracy issues would be a constant struggle.  My experience working with Secretary Clinton offered a powerful counter-narrative.
 
From day one I saw Hillary Clinton's personal commitment to human rights, a commitment that flows naturally from her lifetime of advocacy for the rights of women, children and those most vulnerable in our world.  This commitment manifests itself in her involvement in individual cases and in advancing broader shifts in policy.  Too often senior officials will pay public homage to promoting human rights in the abstract, but decline to raise specific issues in private meetings with foreign officials.  Clinton did just the opposite and because of her commitment, tenacity and smart diplomacy, we made real progress. 
 
In Uzbekistan, for example, in December 2010 she successfully pressed President Karimov for the release of Yusuf Juma, the country's poet laureate who was languishing in a dismal jail.  I was with her in that tense meeting in Tashkent and marveled at her tenacious advocacy on Mr Juma's behalf.  We had important security issues on the agenda, and it would have been easy to say that raising Juma's case was a bridge too far.  But Clinton was determined not just to raise his case but to press successfully for Juma's release.
 
On a broader scale in 2011 and 2012 we made the release of more than 1100 political prisoners an essential element of U.S. re-engagement with Burma. U.S. policy-makers were eager to take advantage of an opening in diplomatic relations after more than 50 years.  The Burmese government, still dominated by the military, was deeply resistant to the release of student activists, labor leaders and others who had opposed its policies.  But on a visit to Burma in December 2011 Secretary Clinton kept this issue on the U.S. agenda and provided the leadership my colleagues and I needed to keep pressing for these releases.  By the end of 2012, the government had freed more than 1100 political prisoners, including a number who had been in prison for a decade or more.  While other rights challenges in Burma remain unresolved, such as ongoing ethnic conflicts and discrimination against the Rohingya, Secretary Clinton's leadership on the prisoner issue was decisive.
 
More broadly, Hillary Clinton's lifelong commitment to fighting discrimination motivated her to raise the global bar in fighting attacks on the LGBT community. This was her deliberate commitment from day one and it culminated with her memorable human rights day speech at the United Nations in Geneva in 2011.  As I stood in the back of the room and watched her deliver that powerful speech to more than 1000 diplomats and others, my pride in being a part of the United States government was never greater.  In that historic moment Hillary Clinton proclaimed that LGBT rights are human rights, and she announced a broader program to make that commitment a central element of U.S. foreign policy.  These are the types of actions that defined Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State and its what she means when she says we must never stop working to make America and the world a better place. And this will be a part of her agenda when she is elected President in November.

In the first of a series of interviews, the indomitable Sarah Kovner, longtime activist, feminist and Democrat speaks with Blogging for Hillary Editor, Ted Smyth

Why are you a Democrat?
It might sound corny, but I believe in social justice where everyone has an equal shot. When I was at High School in South Orange, NJ in the early fifties, I was struck by the absence of equality and was drawn to the civil rights movement. 

When was your first Presidential campaign?  
Adlai Stevenson in 1952; what appealed to us was his intelligence, commitment to justice and his sense of humor. We knocked on doors, went to rallies and learned the importance of getting out the vote. This was a time when nuclear war seemed a real possibility and Senator Joe McCarthy was stirring up fear and bigotry.
What is the most effective way to help in campaigns?
Nothing is more important than speaking directly to friends, neighbors and co-workers about why you support the candidate. In addition, join the campaign office to volunteer in canvassing for votes, knocking on doors, making telephone calls.
What did you learn from the 1968 campaign?  
I was co-chair of the Gene McCarthy New York State campaign and we leveraged the creative talent of New Yorkers to draw attention to Gene's anti-war position. Unfortunately, the Democratic Party was very divided at the convention in August of 1968 and the continuation of those divisions resulted in the election of Richard Nixon, with all the terrible consequences for America that followed. The lesson for today is to realize that we Democrats have a lot more in common. Let unity come from agreement on issues and we should not get separated by personality politics. There is just too much at stake for America.

When did you first meet Hillary?
I first met Hillary in 1992 when Bill was running for President. We were blown away by her ability to speak in paragraphs about important issues such as health care, women's rights, job growth. We knew of her strong record at the Children's Defense Fund but she was really impressive to meet.

Give some examples of why you trust and like Hillary.
Hilary is very thoughtful and genuine, she is kind to the people who work for her, and they are really enthusiastic about her. She is honest and direct; when I spoke to her about her vote on the Iraq war she listened carefully and gave her point of view. She is very approachable and genuinely interested in people and learning from them and finding solutions to problems. What really defines Hillary is a passion for public service and improving society.  

What was your role in the Bill Clinton Administration?
I was Special Assistant to Secretary Shalala at HHS from 1993 to 2001. I focused on women's issues and remember the critical leadership role Hillary played for women's rights around the world, especially at the Beijing Women's Conference in 1995. 

Why is it crucial to elect Hillary?
If I were only allowed to name one thing, it would be the Supreme Court. There is one vacancy now and perhaps two to three more during the next Presidential term. The next President will shape the Supreme Court for a generation or more affecting women's right to choose, voting rights, environmental rights, climate change, worker's rights, everything. If we don't elect Hillary we will lose on every issue we care about.
Another reason is that when you elect a Democratic President you bring in about 7,000 individuals to government who support our causes on behalf of working families and the middle class. The opposite happens when a Republican is in the White House, when equal rights and growth and jobs and family rights are all neglected in favor of the establishment and elites.

You are a super delegate, how did that happen and what are your duties?
Most of the super delegates are elected member of Congress or Governors. I was appointed because I am a member of the Democratic National Committee. One of our roles is to vote at the Convention.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/Voices4Hillary/photos/a.1746239832263679.1073741827.1746239085597087/1751256598428669/?type=3,2016-06-10 14:00:00,31,0,12,30,1,0,0,0,0
1746239085597087_1751257901761872,"Elect a Progressive Who Can Unlock Washington Gridlock

Blogging for Hillary Editor, Ted Smyth, recently sat down with Marie Wilson, a pioneer in the women's movement, President of the Ms Foundation for Women for 20 years, Founder and President Emerita, the White House Project, Advisory Board Chair, VoteRunLead, creator of Take our Daughters to Work Day and Athena Fellow, Barnard College.

You have done amazing things to advance the role of women in leadership since the 1970's, where do you think you had the most impact?

The White House Project, which trained over 15,000 diverse women to run for public office across the country. This is one of the most pressing issues of our time; to encourage more women to enter politics. I sincerely believe that women can help bring people together on the core issues that affect all of us, from creating good-paying jobs, affordable education, healthcare and decent childcare. For example, we've seen how women in the Senate and the Supreme Court have been able to reach across the political divide.

What are the major obstacles remaining for women's equality?

Many in America still see a woman's role as limited to being a wife and mother. We are far behind other developed countries, which have excellent childcare so that both parents can share the work both in and  outside the home. That's why Hillary's plan for universal preschool for America's children is so important. Despite research showing its benefits, only about half of the roughly 8 million 3- and 4- year olds in the U.S. are enrolled in pre-K, with only one in four enrolled in publicly funded pre-K. In addition, workers in every other developed country are entitled to paid leave for newborn care; under Hillary's plan, any worker could take up to 12 weeks of paid leave in order to care for a newborn or sick relative.

If you were a young woman coming out of college today, what would you focus on?

I would go into political leadership. Young women should start by running for School Board, the Parks Commission, then run for the City Council and move on to the State Legislature. If we don't have women in political leadership, nothing will change.

What are young people saying to you about the election?

So many young people admire Hillary and identify with her struggle over the years for fairness and a level playing field for working men and women. Many of them see this as the most important election of their lifetime as we confront the real danger of a Trump presidency. Many young men and women also want to ensure that the political movement started by Bernie continues after the election. In the past, young people have been fired up by elections and then have seen no role for themselves when the election is over. That's actually when the real work of wrestling with Congress will begin, and we will need a national movement to drive all the reforms that Hillary and Bernie agree on.

How important is it to elect Hillary?

Extremely important!  Look, the definition of a progressive is someone who wants to make progress toward a more just and fair country and world. That's who Hillary is, and always has been-- a committed progressive. We have a once-in a-lifetime opportunity to elect a President who not only believes passionately in social justice, but who also has the political skills and toughness to unlock Washington gridlock. The fact that Hillary is also a woman is just icing on the cake.

1746239085597087_1751241588430170,"Ni Neart go Cur le Cheile (Strength in Unity)

By Ted Smyth, Editor, Blogging for Hillary

We Irish know about the emotional gratification of division (Brendan Behan used to joke that the first item on the agenda of any new Irish organization was the split) but we also know the cost in lives and lost opportunity.  The question now facing progressive forces in America is how quickly can we unite in support of Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party,  to ensure four more years of progressive politics in America and the defeat of extremist Trump policies? Because America is so closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, it only takes a small number of progressives to stay at home for a spoiler effect. In 2000, Ralph Nader took 97,000 votes in Florida. If they had gone to Gore, it would have meant no recount, no President George W. Bush and no Iraq war.  

Many millennials may not be aware that Richard Nixon was elected in 1968 because the Dems could not bring themselves to unite behind their nominee. America paid for that indulgence with corruption at the highest levels  and the prolonging of a bloody war in Vietnam.

President Obama today endorsed Hillary and urged Democrats to unite. In a video we posted below, Obama said, ""I don't think there's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.""  He also praised Bernie for an ""incredible campaign"". As we approach the Democratic Convention next month in Philadelphia, it is important to remember what Hillary and Bernie  have in common and why they both represent the best in the American tradition of fair play for all. They both agree that our political and economic system favors the very rich and powerful. They both have similar policies to create a level playing field to end stagnant wages, unemployment and the constant squeeze on the middle class. They both have mobilized millions of men and women of all backgrounds, ages and races to fight for a better and fairer America.
.
We must now come together to support  a new social partnership that stimulates economic growth and creates good jobs, that nominates Supreme Court judges who protect human rights and women's rights, that fights climate change and guarantees affordable healthcare and education.

These goals are worth fighting for, and - to win - the first item on our agenda in July must be unity.
