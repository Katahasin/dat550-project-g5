These are aimed at fulfilling a Trump campaign promise, claiming he would revitalize America's ailing coal industry.

Trump's rambling, manic, often snarky press conference — delivered more in the manner of a churlish insult comic than leader of the free world — the president met with a group of you, a self-titled ""Trump caucus"" of early supporters.

You fawned over him like autograph hunters gushing over their favorite movie star. Rep. Chris Collins of New York: ""Mr. President, we're all honored to be here."" Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee: ""We're excited about the work you're doing."" And Missouri's Billy Long referenced the recent visit of Japan's prime minister: ""I knew you all would hit it off because you're both people persons and great personalities. … I knew you guys would get along good.""

Oh, brother. Has it come down to this? The party of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower in the thrall of a petulant, impulsive, preening and shamelessly amoral president who thinks Vladimir Putin is the apex of effective management.

Republicans, is this really the legacy you choose?

If you are a millennial -- 18 to 34 -- please share your thoughts on this election, and we may reach out to ask you more questions. Here are a few things we're wondering.

What is your general attitude about voting -- duty or not? 

What are your thoughts on the candidates?

Do you plan to vote? 

If you supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, who are you planning to vote for next Tuesday?  

Here's a snippet from the USA Today article:

Muhammad believes it is critical for all Americans to know the truth about our racist past in order to understand these turbulent times and reshape our future. ""I have very little patience for people who lie to themselves or to others. And so, for me, part of the antidote is where we started which is that, at best, we ought to get closer to truth,"" Muhammad tells Bill.
 
""And, if we can face the truth head on, if I can sit here with someone whose own version of mythology is to write policy that says that black kids can't learn, or to write policy that says that police officers have every right to be more fearful of the people who they are supposed to serve and protect than those people themselves. Then, I want to be able to look that person in the eye and say, 'You're kidding yourself and you're lying to others.'…""
 
After five years, Muhammad is departing as director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library for a post at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. His conversation with Bill Moyers was taped on Monday, June 27, in front of a live audience. You can stream the conversation from our website or download it via our podcast feed.  
 
""We always have a choice,"" Muhammad said. ""And the choice is not to be prisoner to the past, not to be prisoner to the existing myths that shroud us, but to make different choices. Because looking back, the benefit and the beauty of history and hindsight is to see the roads not taken. And there are too many roads that we've chosen not to take consistently in this country.""

We need to invest massively in the public sphere to have a renewable energy system, to have good public transit and rail. That money needs to come from somewhere, so it's going to have to come from the people who have the money.

And I actually believe it's deeper than that, that it's about changing the paradigm of a culture that is based on separateness from nature, that is based on the idea that we can dominate nature, that we are the boss, that we are in charge. Climate change challenges all of that. 

It says, you know, all this time that you've been living in this bubble apart from nature, that has been fueled by a substance that all the while has been accumulating in the atmosphere, and you told yourself you were the boss, you told yourself you could have a one-way relationship with the natural world, but now comes the response: 'You thought you were in charge? Think again.' 

And we can either mourn our status as boss of the world and see it as some cosmic demotion — which is why I think the extreme right is so freaked out by climate change that they have to deny it. It isn't just that it is a threat to their profits. It's a threat to a whole worldview that says you have dominion over all things, and that's extremely threatening.""

The night also saw record turnout, reflecting that the tumult of this election so far has captured the attention of many who don't usually vote.

Political sovereignty has been replaced by economic sovereignty as corporate power takes over the reins of governance. The more money influences politics, the more corrupt the political culture becomes. 

Under such circumstances, holding office is largely dependent on having huge amounts of capital at one's disposal, while laws and policies at all levels of government are mostly fashioned by lobbyists representing big business corporations and financial institutions. 

Moreover, such lobbying, as corrupt and unethical as it may be, is now carried out in the open by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other individuals, groups and institutions invested in the militarization of US society.

- The Forbes 400 now own about as much wealth as the nation's entire African-American population — plus more than a third of the Latino population — combined.

- The median American family has a net worth of $81,000. The Forbes 400 own more wealth than 36 million of these typical American families.

Obama asks Robinson about an essay from a forthcoming book she just completed that examines the harmful role that fear plays in our democracy. Robinson tells Obama:

""[F]ear was very much—is on my mind, because I think that the basis of democracy is the willingness to assume well about other people.

You have to assume that basically people want to do the right thing. I think that you can look around society and see that basically people do the right thing. But when people begin to make these conspiracy theories and so on, that make it seem as if what is apparently good is in fact sinister, they never accept the argument that is made for a position that they don't agree with—you know?""

The President: Yes.

Robinson: ""Because [of] the idea of the 'sinister other.' And I mean, that's bad under all circumstances.

A revolution is not just for the purpose of correcting past injustices, a revolution involves a projection of man/woman into the future…

BILL MOYERS: ""I'm not sure that I understand why you chose to live like that when you could have gotten out and did. Your parents worked hard. You worked hard. You got out. You go to Washington. You have a fine teaching position at an important institution and you choose, in a sense, to go home again, although it's only a couple of miles away.""

KYLE DARGAN: ""When I first got to AU, I lived in Glover Park, which some people call upper Georgetown which is right around AU, very quiet, but none of my neighbors really talked to me. The police would follow me around sometimes, which is fine by me, because I felt like I had a police escort all the time. I knew I wasn't going to do anything.

It's that idea of community, like why would I want to live somewhere where none of my neighbors talked to me, most likely, because I'm young and my skin is brown. That's not, that's not home to me.

And the right of a woman to control her own body.

I believe gay rights and gay marriage.

Those are my views, and it is no secret. But I came here today, because I believe from the bottom of my heart that it is vitally important for those of us who hold different views to be able to engage in a civil discourse.

Too often in our country -- and I think both sides bear responsibility for us -- there is too much shouting at each other. There is too much making fun of each other.

Now, in my view, and I say this as somebody whose voice is hoarse, because I have given dozens of speeches in the last few months, it is easy to go out and talk to people who agree with you. 

...
But it is harder, but not less important, for us to try and communicate with those who do not agree with us on every issue.

Like men like Adams and Washington and Madison did things with words by accident. As Ingersoll pointed out and is true today, the fact that there was no God in the Constitution was debated at every state ratifying convention.

It was said that, 'Under this constitution, an atheist, a Jew, or God help us even a universalist could become president,' which was true in theory, but has actually not turned out to be true in practice. One thing that was true is you did not have to belong to a church throughout the 19th century to become president, as Ingersoll often spoke of Lincoln. And it very much shows what the attitudes were during the Civil War, which was thought by many to be God's judgment. And Lincoln certainly could not have been an atheist, but he wasn't religious in any conventional sense.

And anyway, this Protestant ministers came to Lincoln and they wanted to amend the Constitution to replace ""We the people"" not with God, but with Jesus Christ.

Bill Moyers  interviewed Doctorow as part of his ""World of Ideas"" series in 1988 on the role that writers should play in our society. Watch a clip from that interview that includes the following exchange about the importance and the discounting -- in Doctorow's view -- of dissent  during the Reagan years in America.

E.L. DOCTOROW: ... [T]he whole idea of dissent has been sort of discounted. The value of dissent is no longer seen, I think, generally by the average American — people who say things that you don't want to hear; people who point out things you'd rather not have pointed out; the people who nag and say this isn't good enough, that's not good enough, try this, try that. This kind of thing, this kind of dialogue, to use that term — this kind of discourse is very discounted today. It has no real value.

BILL MOYERS: You're not talking about the writer as a critic of this or that program of a particular administration, you're talking about the writer whose works challenge the prevailing mythology of society — who challenge the underlying belief system of the rulers.

DOCTOROW: The key thing is mythology. When ideas go unexamined and unchallenged for a long enough time, certain things happen. They become mythological and they become very, very powerful. They create conformity. They intimidate. They coerce. The person who sets himself up and says, ""Wait, just a minute,"" is going to find himself in a very uncomfortable position.

MOYERS: Well, this is an important point. The novelist of the '30s wrote about the failure of America to nourish life but today that's considered in many quarters an unpatriotic theme and those who do take on those themes — as you have said — get roundly criticized by the orthodox intellectuals who are defending the prevailing myths.

DOCTOROW: It seems to be the case that there is a disinclination of critics to accept the authority of the individual witness, namely the writer.

MOYERS: Who challenges the state.

DOCTOROW: Who challenges the current orthodoxy.
