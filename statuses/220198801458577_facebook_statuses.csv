Trump's National Lead Increases to 35.6% 
Going into the Third GOP Debate it's Trump, Carson and Rubio 

Washington, D.C., October 27, 2015 â€“ Going into the third GOP debate on Wednesday, One America News Network's latest national poll shows New York real estate mogul Donald Trump well ahead with a commanding 35.6 percent.  Dr. Ben Carson landed in the number two position with 21.7 percent, trailing Trump by 13.9 points.   Senator Marco Rubio rounds out the top three with 10.8 percent.   The top three GOP Presidential candidates have a whopping 68.1 percent of the total vote.   Rounding out the top five is former Governor Jeb Bush at 7.6 percent followed by Senator Ted Cruz at 5.9 percent.  Former HP executive Carly Fiorina just missed a top five finish with 5.7 percent, just two-tenths of a percent behind Cruz.  The poll, concluded Monday night, polled 906 registered Republicans and has a margin of error of 3 percent. 

 

According to Robert Herring Sr., CEO of One America News Network, ""It's all Trump going into the third debate.  Mr. Trump's continued top national ranking will also make him the candidate to target Wednesday night.""
