'I learned to keep my mouth shut in certain situations,' the mother-of-one had testified when asked why she never pressed Hernandez about Bradley being shot.

'I played my role. Meaning I cleaned and I did everything else. There was no reason for me to ask any questions,' she added.

What a sad, paltry life such a beautiful girl settled for.

To call Russia our enemy right now is not exactly accurate. It would be rather more fitting to call Russia our rival. This might seem like a minute distinction, and yet it is a telling one. A rival is a strategic competitor -- an equal who competes for superiority and who strives for the same goal. An enemy, on the other hand, is the hostile opposition -- an antagonist that seeks the destruction of its opponent.

1.  Russia did not hack the election; they did not tap into the voting machines; they did not use artificial intelligence to hack into the brains of people in order to make them vote for Donald Trump.    Hillary was just a very, very, very awful candidate.  The Democrats know this and at the presser today with the ""bipartisan"" leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee speak Wednesday about their ongoing investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.   The Republican took the ""sucker"" role by going first and attempting to ""play it down"" the middle.  Warner wrapped it up leaving doubt on the President while Burr broke out in a sweat.  Remember the games of life learned on the playground......?

2.  Trump is NOT a secret KGB agent fromthe Kremlin and on 19 December 2016, the National Report web site published an article reporting that President-elect Donald Trump would make a stop on his ""victory tour"" over the Christmas 2016 weekend at famed Red Square, a plaza next to the Kremlin in Moscow, the capital of Russia.  None of this occured.

3.  Maxine Waters is NOT James Brown in a dress.  

4.   Not true:   A computer infected by malware proved a Vermont power company has been targeted for disruption by Russian hackers.  The infected laptop was not connected to the power grid, and no evidence documents that the malware was placed on the laptop by Russian hackers and/or by persons with the intent of disrupting a U.S. power grid. 

5.  A spokesman for the German government on Monday denied media reports that U.S. President Donald Trump handed a multibillion-euro invoice to Chancellor Angela Merkel when they met in Washington earlier this month.

""I would hope that the Freedom Caucus would get credit,"" Brooks said. 

Racing out of the conference meeting to catch his plane, Rep. Mo Brooks, a member of the defiant House Freedom Caucus -- the group that had argued at every turn that the House bill didn't go far enough -- was pleased with the power his caucus had exhibited. If people had doubted the Freedom Caucus would remain an influential force under President Donald Trump, there was no questioning now their ability to exercise immense influence over not only their leadership's agenda but their new president's as well......

Now,the question is, after their major show of strength, what will become of the House's most conservative and now despised contingent?

But the group now also must face a party and a president frustrated that their demands for a more conservative approach forced the legislation to a standstill that leaves the Affordable Care Act in place.

428053320608798_1310333915714063,"Putting Lipstick on a Pig

This morning I got up early as I normally do and watched Fox for the follow-up to the disastrous Friday health care vote.  Simultaneously I watched the Maddow show, which shows as a rerun.  Here is the stark contrast...... the Fox broadcast brought in Louie Gohmert (TX-01)  who attempted to clear Trump, the Freedom Caucus and members of the Freedom Caucus of all wrong doing by saying that the vote on the bill was based upon ""a lie"".  Now whether this lie meant something, something, something about the parliamentarian or not...... the ""average Joe"" is not hearing the mumbles because they are simply..... too busy with life to follow the arcane and complicated ""where thens or where art thous"".......  All Jane and John Citizen knows is that ""we lost and they won"".  

Now, lets break it down even further, when Jane and John hears that the health care bill passage was ""based upon a lie"".......  the only ""lie"" that they understand is that the elected leaders , for the past 7.5 years ran on ""repeal ad replace"", when they knew that they had no intentions of repealing and had ""bupkis""   to replace it with.....  You see in ""soundbite world"" , we lied and they were telling the truth.  They meaning Schumer, Pelosi and company.  No one cares about the Parliamentarian.......  no one.

So...... we wake up this morning to the excuses, the calls for Paul Ryan to go just like Boehner , the yamma, yamma, yammma....... and the vow by some that ""next time"" it will work.....  But there will be no next time here.  This was a ""blown opportunity"" and sometimes opportunity will only knock once.  BUT......  if you take a moment you will see that some within the Republican ranks feel a bit of vindication.  The Freedom Caucus can strike up a ""win"".  It is a pyrrhic victory for sure, but after years of being sidelined they finally ""won"".

""Members of the House Freedom Caucus have shown they want the moon, or nothing, when considering reform of health-care policy. They aren't going to get the moon, so what they should do is nothing""  And now, they have ""won""..... but the prize is a big ""nothing"".  And in a binary choice, voting ""down"" on one side means that you vote ""up"" on the other.  Obamacare is the law of the land now.  AND, don't kid yourselves when you think that EVERY EFFORT will not be made to make it a success.  

Americans are just not like that.  We are not going to let ""Grandma"" die or beg at the church door to pay for her pills.  We are not going to let little Billy or Mary go sick.  None of the ""horrible outcomes and failures"" will occur because we will roll up our sleeves and be compassionate.  And in our compassion, we will make Obamacare very successful because we have no choice.

On the other side, you see, what was ""killed"" yesterday was something that ""improves Medicaid, expands health-savings accounts, re-introduces market forces into the system, repeals numerous taxes, and reduces the federal debt (compared to current law) by tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.""

Was it perfect?  Nope.....  Was it everything the Freedom Caucus wanted?  Nope......  But never let perfection be the enemy of ""good enough"".  And guess what?  All Jane and John Citizen knows is that they have been lied to by the Republicans.  They will listen to the humma, humma, humma, today and know in their heart that not only was there no plan, there was no will to work together and make a plan.  

So...... am I saying that I agree with Jane and Joe Citizen?  That is not important but what IS important is that Jane and Joe perceives a loss and perceives and lie....... and perceptions ARE reality.  We lost this optic folks and there is no lipstick strong enough for this pig to wear that will make it look pretty.

Obamacare won yesterday. And we lost this chance.

428053320608798_1303872493026872,"Why I dislike much of the popular music today.....

God gave us a wonderful gift in singing.  One of the greatest benefits of song is how a melody can penetrate one's soul.  The tune and the lyrics stay with a person in a way that becomes permanent in our thinking.   It may have been years since you sang or heard a song but every now and again it rises up out of your spirit.  Have you ever sung a song and could not get rid of it?  It just keeps floating around in your head.  Try as you might the melody and lyrics remain in your mind.

428053320608798_1303870929693695,"Who was St. Patrick?

Patrick was a young man who was taken captive as a slave among thousands of his countrymen.  He had grown up among the churched and the civilized.  His captors were druids, worshiping the things of darkness and evil.  As a slave, Patrick would spend time in prayer to the God of his childhood.  On one occasion,  Patrick heard the Lord speak to him that he would be returning home.  Patrick did escape and made his way back to his homeland.  He did not stay very long however, because God sent him back to Ireland as a missionary.  The religious leaders of the day told him he was not qualified but he went anyway.  As so often is the case, the religious leaders were wrong and Patrick was right.  God has called a multitude of people to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth.  He is sending young and old, rich and poor, male and female.  If you will hear His voice, He has a work for you to do.  You could be a firebrand that lights the world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Patrick brought the Gospel of Christ to a people that sat in great darkness.  He preached with signs, wonders and miracles.  Through his preaching and ministry, St. Patrick turned an entire nation to God.  That is why we remember St. Patrick today.  This Gospel must be preached.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1303870929693695/?type=3,2017-03-18 07:07:02,7,2,4,5,2,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_1291936747553780,"Ammerkka 2017:  A Dystopian Fantasy

       Once upon a time, in a land that now seems far far away, was a country that called itself the United States of America.  It was a ""Republic"" although many inaccurately described its as a ""democracy"" primarily because education became dismal, at least for the masses who continued to send their offspring to government run schools which became unified indoctrination factories that took in children for ""pre-kindergarten"" as maleables and produced fully compliant graduates at the age of 18.  These maleables then went on to public or private institutions of ""higher learning"".  These indoctrinated souls who managed to get to that point were so inued in ""victim's studies"" and ""social Justice"" studies that allowed them to find their ""niche""........  

      Within this framework of indoctrination, the school day was busy.  So busy that the basics of history, mathematics, and English fell by the ""wayside"" since..... it is hard to complete total indoctrination in only 12 or 13 years, 5 days a week, or 179 days on an average per year.  So ""they"" provided ""buzzwords"".  The ""Happy Words"" were ""inclusive"", ""love"", ""safety"", ""sex"", ""food"", ""eat"", ""victim"", ""Democrat"" ...... to name a few.  The ""Bad Words"" were ""Nazi"", ""hate"", ""fascism"", ""victim"", ""_____phobia"", ""white males"", ""scarey"", ""Republican"".  Mind you, they did not know what ""Nazi's"" were nor what ""fascism"" meant .... but they were taught that it ""felt bad"" and were provided with safety pins, blankets, puppies and kittens at their ""higher education"" institutions and they knew that this ""felt good""..... along with a cup of hot chocolate and an adult diaper.

       Many of these ""youngsters"" (some as old as 30 -35) were encouraged to ""act on their micro-aggressions"" - attacking buildings, people and ideas that did not go along with their indoctrination or believe as they do.  These words were triggered by ""politicians"", mostly in their 70's, 80's and beyond who would signal to their useful ""youngsters"" through the ""Bad Words"" such as ""scarey"", ""Nazi"", ""dictator"" or especially the boogeyman ""Hitler"", that those who did not go along with the plan .... any plan that they learned during their period of indoctrination were  ""bad"".   And because they were ""bad"" it was OK to ""crush, kill, or destroy"" the offender's person, property or reputation.  This was so that they could feel ""safe"" again.  Never once realizing they they were creating the totalitarian state, which is quite ""unsafe"". 

      So...... then we have an ""election"" of sorts on one side of the equation.  The elected was ordained to be a woman who the ""politicians"" felt worthy of the position.  She would get rid of the corruption (because being corrupt herself she knew what it looked like), make a way for ""victims"" --- in this case the victimized woman like her (rich, white, privileged and old), and well..... it was her turn.  So they rigged the primary.  It was a ""kangaroo primary"" in which debate questions were given to her in advance, news papers colluded with one another to help, poor health disguised, debates held as a ""midnight special"" often opposite a sporting event.   

      And she still lost.  Because at the end of the day, 179 days per year of indoctrination did not sway the masses of people who refused the predominantly controlled indoctrination system of the urban coasts.  Their lives were different and they viewed the candidate pushed by these people who called themselves ""liberals"" as ridiculous, as they looked at unemployment in their towns whilst being told that ""America is a full employment"" and knew that they were being passed a ""wooden nickel"".

      They elected a business man.  The politicians went wild.  They screamed, they cried, and then after wiping their eyes, they knew that they had to pull out the ""Bad Words"".  In one day, the business man can be ""Hitler"", ""Stalin"", ""Lenin"" and ""Bull Connor"" all wrapped up into one.  Because for 50 years, whilst being taught ""social justice"", ""approximation math"", and ""feelings studies""....... what do these young dolts know anyways?  

    And then the oldsters got together and said...... ""its not working""...... Remember ""Russia""?  And they all nodded.....  Heck, its far away, and the economy is pretty bad right now.  AND THEY HAVE A BOOGEYMAN!  A ""white guy"" named Putin!  (What about China, one brave soul asked?   ---- Nah...... between the karate chops, the ability to buy and sell us while taking down all of our technology .... that might be like kicking the hornet's nest without shoes on).  So they settled on Russia.  And the press went along.  After all, what is a good story without someone to write it and broadcast it?

    Years from now, one of the indoctrinates will look around at the total destruction of what used to be America and say ""I heard once  in a movie""  that a historian and moralist, who was otherwise known simply as Lord Acton, expressed this opinion in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887: ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.""   Or those we believe to be great.

Latimer, the son of parents who had escaped slavery, was an inventor, draftsman, engineer, and scientist, as well as an author, poet, musician, and philanthropist. It is a little known fact that he was the person who actually drew the blueprints for Alexander Graham Bell's telephone in 1878. Three years later, in 1881, he and assistant Joseph Nichols were the first persons to receive a patent for the direct forerunner to today's commonly used light bulb. Prior to this, the electric lamp by Thomas Edison and others had no real practical use because it could not emit light for an extended period. But the new light bulb by Latimer (with assistant Nichols) used a revolutionary method of manufacturing carbon filaments that produced light for effectively extended periods. It was because of this ingenious invention that Latimer was asked by numerous countries, states, and cities — including Philadelphia — to write an instruction manual (which he did in 1890) and to supervise the installation of incandescent light plants. In addition, it is quite interesting that he was the original draftsman for Edison (inventor of the 1879 temporary electric lamp) who relied on Latimer as the expert witness in Edison's patent infringement suit.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1262867907127331/?type=3,2017-02-06 14:02:56,29,6,9,24,4,1,0,0,0

428053320608798_1260860980661357,"In May 1952 in middle Tennessee, there lived a Girl Scout captain following the same dream as  our founder Juliette Low–Girl Scouts of the USA for every American girl. Girl Scout Captain Josephine Holloway, a former Social Worker, purchased 50 acres of land with the help of her husband, Dr. Guerney Holloway, for a Girl Scout campgrounds dedicated for African American girls. The camp was a first for Girl Scouts in the South. Before the civil rights movement, local laws and customs prevented Mrs. Holloway's Troop 200 from camping overnight with other troops during camping events.

To give her troop a true camping experience, Mrs. Holloway searched for land with running water, such as a stream, for her scouts to bathe and cook. She found a land lot in Millersville, Tennessee, which even had a farmhouse that the troop would later use as their lodge.

The field had been unattended and the farmhouse dilapidated, but Mrs. Holloway was a visionary. She encouraged her scouts and their parents to envision the cabins, trails, and the pool. Every weekend they visited the grounds, tackled the overgrowth, and followed the instructions of Mrs. Holloway's designs for the camp.

Since its dedication 60 years ago, the Girl Scouts of Middle Tennessee have purchased additional lots to increase the campground's size to the current 76 acres. They later honored Mrs. Holloway with the camp's name change to Camp Holloway.

Many people in Tennessee see Mrs. Holloway as a hidden heroine. Her efforts to help Ms. Low's dream for every American girl to have the opportunity to become a Girl Scout are heroic due to social challenges before and during civil rights movement.

TaMara Powell at Camp Holloway. September 2011

I had to visit the campgrounds myself. Camp Holloway has been completely renovated. Girls can experience archery, running through an obstacle course, rappelling off of a tower, rock climbing, swimming, team adventuring, and tree climbing.

I can only imagine Mrs. Holloway would be so proud with the updates. There is even a patch that visiting Girl Scout campers can earn, called the ""Josephine Holloway/Guerney's Cabin Patch.""

The Negro Motorist Green Book

The Negro Motorist Green Book (at times styled The Negro Motorist Green-Book or titled The Negro Travelers' Green Book) was an annual guidebook for African-American roadtrippers, commonly referred to simply as the Green Book. It was originated and published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and black poverty limited car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles as soon as they could. In response, Green expanded the coverage in his book from the New York area to much of North America, also founding a travel agency.

Many Black Americans took to driving, in part to avoid segregation on public transportation. As the writer George Schuyler put it in 1930, ""all Negroes who can do so purchase an automobile as soon as possible in order to be free of discomfort, discrimination, segregation and insult."" Black Americans employed as athletes, entertainers, and salesmen also traveled frequently for work purposes.

African-American travelers faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences, such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles, being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels, and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from whites-only ""sundown towns"". Green founded and published The Negro Motorist Green Book to tackle such problems, compiling resources ""to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable

428053320608798_1258317624249026,"Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life was an academic journal published by the National Urban League (NUL). The journal acted as a sociological forum for the emerging topic of African-American studies and was known for fostering the literary culture during the Harlem Renaissance. It was published monthly from 1923 to 1942 and then quarterly through 1949.

The studies published in the early issues of Opportunity were conducted and funded by NUL and clearly supported the social mission of an academic journal connected with the missions of NUL and Fisk University. Topics centered on the social challenges faced by black people at the time, including access to employment, housing, sanitation and education. The journal's motto ""Opportunity not Alms"" describes the editorial direction as does the journal's manifesto: ""Opportunity is a venture inspired by a long insistent demand, both general and specific, for a journal of Negro life that would devote itself religiously to an interpretation of the social problems of the Negro population.... The policy of Opportunity will be definitely constructive. It will aim to present, objectively, facts of Negro life. It hopes, thru an analysis of these social questions, to provide a basis of understanding; encourage interracial co-operation in the working out of these problems.""

While the journal was published from 1923 to 1949, its main influence on African-American literature was from 1923 to 1928. The immediate objective of Opportunity was to publish dependable data concerning black life and race relations. Editor-in-chief Charles S. Johnson wrote in the first issue of Opportunity, ""Accurate and dependable facts can correct inaccurate and slanderous assertions that have gone unchallenged… and what is most important, to inculcate a disposition to see enough of interest and beauty of their own lives to rid themselves of the inferior feeling of being Negro"".

Central to Opportunity's founding were two patrons: Mrs. Ruth Standish Baldwin, the white widow of a railroad magnate and George Edmund Haynes, a graduate of Fisk University, Yale University, and Columbia University, who would become the NUL's first executive secretary. The interracial character of the League's board was set from its first days and also became the template for Charles Johnson's approach to fostering interest, support, and occasion for African-American art and artists. Critics of the journal as well as the Harlem Renaissance thought that Johnson's literary content may have been pandering to his white audience and patrons. Wallace Thurman stated ""The results of the Renaissance have been sad rather than satisfactory, in that critical standards have been ignored and the measure of achievement has been racial rather than literary""",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1258317624249026/?type=3,2017-02-01 13:31:30,5,1,1,4,1,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_1241110605969728,"TRUMP VS LEWIS ROUND 1

The legendary Freedom Rider and top organizer of the 1963 March on Washington seems intent on making Trump his new fight.

Lewis said in an interview on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, that he doesn't believe Trump is a ""legitimate president"" and that he wouldn't be attending the presidential inauguration for the first time in his 30-year political career, citing the intelligence community's explosive findings over Russian hacking of the presidential election.
Mind you, he has no proof that Hillary Clinton would have won the election if the supposed ""Russian Hacking"" ""incident"" did not occur, in fact he does not even know if this ""Russian Hacking"" occurred by actual Russians or some 14 year old kid and his friends, one of whom has a ""Russian sounding"" surname, is playing around in his basement but it is his ""opinion"" and by golly  he is sticking with it!

Then Donald Trump, never one to shrink away from a fight, tweets:  ""Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get! ""This caused several at MSNBC to start spitting blood from between their teeth with anger.  ""Ye Gads!  How dare he offend a man who almost lost his life on THAT BRIDGE"".

Ummm. To many people old and young, without saying it….. they really know about as much about the history of John Lewis as they do the history of just about anything in America.  Remember, some of the liberal colleges, in their ridiculous attempt to be sensitive to the needs of their delicate students do not require American History of their students majoring in History.  In throwing out the information about what they perceive as the ""bad ole white guys"", they threw out Black history as well.

In addition, although the fainting and posturing will undoubtedly continue, even though the commentators on CNN who reside in AFFLUENT ATLANTA will speak glowingly about the progress of Atlanta, as recently as October of 2016  Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart  said this:   Atlanta is among the country's fastest-growing urban regions, it is still among the worst for economic mobility.

""This community continues to attract new residents, to attract business operations relocating from elsewhere, and to attract new investment,"" he said. ""Yet real per capita income today is lower than it was in 2000, and we have pockets of entrenched poverty and disinvestment.""

You think Trump might have a point here?",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1241110605969728/?type=3,2017-01-16 12:36:35,10,7,4,7,0,2,0,0,1

428053320608798_1241078749306247,"The Greatest Show on Earth!

Have you ever noticed how things tasted, looked and felt better years ago when you were a child, young adult, newly married or newly whatever?  Peanut butter, potato chips, and fried chicken tasted better.  Either they were, in fact different, or just by virtue of the fact that  WE were newer, the experiences were superior to our more sophisticated tastes.  Such is the case of ""The Greatest Show on Earth"".  Last night my youngest daughter and I attended the last performance of the The Ringling Bros. Circus.  It was definitely not what I remembered either from my childhood seeing it in Philadelphia or when I took the kids when they were very young.  Gone, were the clowns with the red nose, fluffy hair and big shoes.  Instead we saw very cartoonish space funny guys mingling with the crowd in strange ways.  One of the pseudo-clowns attempted to sit on the lap of a father who was there with his  little boy.  No matter how much the dad looked uncomfortable with this the clown kept messing with his hair and leaning on the edge of the man's seat.   Then, with the exception of the brief lion and tiger performance, we were treated to an array of dog, pony, pig and llamas jumping over a hoop or doing doggie tricks.  The clowns were doing something on another ring that some of us missed because it was either indecipherable, un-seeable or generally uninteresting.  No elephants (my favorite), bears, dare-devils, tighropes, women hanging by their hair, acrobats, little people (there were a couple of children), the Walenda types or what have you.  Due to mounting criticism from animal rights groups, the Ringling Bros. phased out the elephant acts entirely. 

So, the ""Greatest Show on Earth"" is now winding down and coming to a natural end.  Yes, this great show experienced ""slow-downs"" before, due to the Great Depression, but managed to stay in business.  The Hartford Circus Fire occurred on July 6, 1944, in Hartford, Connecticut, during an afternoon performance that was attended by approximately 7,500 to 8,700 people. It was one of the worst fire disasters in the history of the United States. Although the Hartford Fire Department responded quickly, the fire was fanned by the fact that the canvas circus tent had been waterproofed through a mixture of highly flammable paraffin and gasoline. During the ensuing panic Emmett Kelly, the tramp clown, threw a bucket of water at the burning canvas tent, and a poignant photograph of his futile attempt was transmitted around the world as news spread of the disaster. At least 167 people were killed in the disaster, and hundreds more were injured. Some of the dead remain unidentified to this day, even with modern DNA techniques. 

In the following investigation, it was discovered that the tent had not been fireproofed.  

There were other stops and starts for this show but they always managed to survive,until now.  Many animal welfare and animal rights organizations are opposed to the use of wild animals in circuses. The groups argue that animals used in the circus are subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment during training, harsh conditions during transport, and a general lack of mental and physical stimulation. 

  Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey was investigated following the death of a lion who died from heat and lack of water while the circus train was traveling through the Mojave Desert.[43]In 1998, the USDA filed charges against Ringling Bros. for forcing a sick elephant to perform The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), PETA and other animal groups sued the circus, alleging that it violated the Endangered Species Act by its treatment of Asian elephants in its circus. 

n March 2015, Feld Entertainment, the parent company announced it would stop using elephants[50] in their shows by 2018; stating that the 13 elephants that were part of their shows would be sent to the circus' Center for Elephant Conservation, which at that time housed over 40 elephants.[51][52] Feld explained that this action was not a result of the animal rights groups allegations that had been deemed unproven by the court (noting that those groups were ordered to pay Feld $25.2 million in settlement for making false allegations), but rather due to the patchwork of local laws regarding whether elephants could be used in entertainment shows.

Oh well, whatever the reason, changing tastes, shorter attention spans, animal rights, or dwindling audiences……  The Greatest Show, now being a shadow of what it once was, will close after May of this year.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1241078749306247/?type=3,2017-01-16 11:45:54,11,1,4,7,1,0,0,3,0

The video, released on YouTube by Unite for America, not only features Sheen and Schiff, but also Debra Messing, James Cromwell, BD Wong, Noah Wyle, Freda Payne, Bob Odenkirk, J. Smith Cameron, Michael Urie, Moby, Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit, Christine Lahti, Steven Pasquale, Dominic Fumusa and Emily Tyra.

Let's take a look at who THEY  ARE and YOU judge their gravitas:

a.  Ramón Antonio Gerardo Estévez (born August 3, 1940), better known by his stage name Martin Sheen, is an American actor who first became known for his roles in the films The Subject Was Roses (1968) and Badlands (1973), and later achieved wide recognition for his leading role in Apocalypse Now (1979).Sheen was greatly influenced by the actor James Dean.  Sheen's latest activism includes attendances at meetings of the environmentalist group Earth First![ and speaking appearances at youth empowerment events called We Day on behalf of Free The Children, an international charity and educational partner.  Sheen initially endorsed New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, and helped raise funds for his campaign. After Richardson dropped out of the campaign, Sheen stated in a BBC Two interview with Graham Norton that he was supporting Barack Obama.

b.  Richard Schiff (born May 27, 1955) is an American actor and comedian. He is perhaps best known for playing Toby Ziegler on The West Wing, a role for which he received an Emmy Award. Schiff made his directorial debut with The West Wing, directing an episode entitled ""Talking Points."" He is on the National Advisory Board of the Council for a Livable World.  Schiff is a member of the Democratic Party; he supported Barack Obama in the 2008 US Presidential Election. Previously, he had endorsed Senator Joe Biden, before Biden dropped out

c.  The ""also rans"" who you would never have heard of........ A collection of ""bit part"" and ""cameo actors"", elderly singers and people recognizable in re-runs from sitcoms in the 80's and 90's.  

So watch and laugh........ they have been forgotten and should stay that way.

428053320608798_1202564286491027,"Good Morning Coffee Corner!  Giving Thanks.....

I have not been posting much over the past month or so because of a number of things - mostly personal, however, I will weave them into this short statement.  Thanksgiving to Christmas is truly ""the most wonderful time of the year"".  And this season is especially exciting because of the promise of a brighter future.  Yes, I was and am a strong supporter of Donald Trump.  I have been truly happy with each and every one of his cabinet picks.  Had a couple of questions about one but settled that in my mind very quickly.  We should see good things from this administration in a manner that will require less eye-shutting or suspension of common sense than the last administration.  

We live in a great country.  A country in which we should think twice or at least a dozen times before we decide to put it down or burn the flag.  I don't believe the ""Russians are coming to get us"" or that they ""made"" Hillary lose.  She managed that all on her own.  There will one day be a female president I am just thankful to God it was not her.  So that is my first ""thanks"" of the season.

My second is that I grew up in a nuclear household.  As my Dad is ailing, I am thankful for the time we had and the privilege that I had to grow up with a father and mother in residence.  We traveled the world and lived in places that the couple who started out in Kingston, Jamaica would never have dreamed of.  I remember when I asked my mother if we are technically Jamaican ...... She answered emphatically ""You are ONLY American"".  They embraced the possibilities of this America as only hopeful immigrants could do.  They stressed hard work, family and perseverance, not color of skin.  With that direction, they have a son who is a surgeon, attorney, business people , a Ph.D. and the list goes on.  (I ave several siblings) ----- And no, we have not been in jail, public assistance or drugs.  I am thankful for all of this and it is my second ""thanks"" ---- in no particular order.

As my father is in hospital right now, I give thanks for having him this long.  Getting back to the lack of posts, I find myself with very little to say.  My father suffered a hemorrhagic stroke two days before Thanksgiving.  As I watch my 5 very strong, tall, young-ish, handsome and attentive brothers hover over Dad hoping for signs of him stirring, responding or something........ even a movement of the eyebrows...... I hope that he realizes how ""rich"" he really was to have the deep love and affection of his children.  They say that men will leave their parents once married, not true with my brothers who have always found times, place and devotion for their father who spoke to them at least once a day all of their lives.  For this experience I give my third ""thanks"" - in no particular order.

And finally, I give thanks for another year on this earth with my immediate family.  My daughters, knock on wood, ""appear"" to be good girls.  I know that I have been the ""gestapo queen"" with them but they are ""A"" students, independent and seemingly talented in many ways.  They honor their father with respect and thoughtfulness ---- a very important trait for young people to garner because it follows that they then respect themselves.  My husband has been a steadfast and loyal family person, even with the ""sticks and stones"" thrown at him, he continues his walk with God in prayer and has never tossed his family, friends or obligations to the side.  For my small immediate family, I give thanks. In no particular order, of course.

Finally, tell me what YOU give thanks for .  I would like to share your joy with you as I am sure that many would as well.

Luciano Pavarotti, Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI (Italian pronunciation: [luˈtʃaːno pavaˈrɔtti]; 12 October 1935 – 6 September 2007) was an Italian operatic tenor who also crossed over into popular music, eventually becoming one of the most commercially successful tenors of all time. He made numerous recordings of complete operas and individual arias, gaining worldwide fame for the quality of his tone, and eventually established himself as one of the finest tenors of the 20th century.

As one of the Three Tenors, Pavarotti became well known for his televised concerts and media appearances. From the beginning of his professional career as a tenor in 1961 in Italy to his final performance of ""Nessun dorma"" at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin,Pavarotti was at his best in bel canto operas, pre-Aida Verdi roles, and Puccini works such as La bohème, Tosca, and Madama Butterfly. Pavarotti was also noted for his charity work on behalf of refugees and the Red Cross, amongst others. He died from pancreatic cancer on 6 September 2007.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1140263816054408/?type=3,2016-10-12 16:06:51,12,2,1,11,1,0,0,0,0

He was the subject of a newspaper feature in Cleveland, Ohio, for a heroic rescue in 1916 of workers trapped within a water intake tunnel, 50 ft (15 m) beneath Lake Erie.He performed his rescue using a hood fashioned to protect his eyes from smoke and featuring a series of air tubes that hung near the ground to draw clean air beneath the rising smoke. This enabled Morgan to lengthen his ability to endure the inhospitable conditions of a smoke-filled room. Morgan is also credited as the first African American in Cleveland to own an automobile, and as the inventor of the electric traffic signal feature red yellow and green indicators. His other inventions include the development of a chemical for hair-straightening.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1140261242721332/?type=3,2016-10-12 16:04:02,9,1,2,9,0,0,0,0,0

I had a salty discussion with some of my girlfriends in which I used the ""F"" word; the ""B"" word; the ""C"" word""; the ""S"" word"", the ""P"" word; the ""G"" word; the ""N"" word; and the ""L"" word ...... and oh yeah...... the ""Z"" word. And that's before I got to the Jamaican cuss words, Spanglish cuss words and German cuss words.   There goes my bid for office...... Dang....... Oh oh...... that might be another one that slips out.  

The preposterous idea that you can have a recording of a PRIVATE conversation and use it to pillory a person running for office is maddening.  But it is also taking the eye off of the real discussion that Hillary had with business leaders about open borders and the fact that once again she lied to the public.  So just for a ""P"" recap, lets look at some more ""P"" stories.

Little did I know that he was leading a globalist charge intent on diminishing American stature on the world stage.

In all, the Bush presidencies — both of them — were my first exposure to ""RINOs"", and absent of the sex embarrasments, were functional clones of the Clintons.

Seeing Bush 43 get all squishy/melty with Michelle Obama this past weekend provides sufficient imagery and reinforces the belief in many that there isn't a dime's difference in either party. Democrats tell Republicans to ""jump"", and the RINOs say ""how high?""

The Bushes (and Romney, Ryan, Boehner ...) scammed the Nation. I too fell for the ruse, hence the Trump insurrection.

God save America.

 A different witness said that the pie had whipped cream as a topping.

 After this, the protester reportedly said something to Johnson. This prompted the mayor to allegedly tackle the protester and punch him in the face ""repeatedly,"" more than half a dozen times, landing ""five to 10"" blows.

428053320608798_1122074721206651,"Dale Chihuly (born September 20, 1941), is an American glass sculptor and entrepreneur. His works are considered unique to the field of blown glass, ""moving it into the realm of large-scale sculpture"". The technical difficulties of working with glass forms are considerable, yet Chihuly uses it as the primary medium for installations and environmental artwork.  In 1976, while Chihuly was in England, he was involved in a head-on car accident during which he flew through the windshield. His face was severely cut by glass and he was blinded in his left eye. After recovering, he continued to blow glass until he dislocated his right shoulder in a 1979 bodysurfing accident.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1122074721206651/?type=3,2016-09-20 10:21:48,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_1120324848048305,"The Season of the False ""god"".

In the eyes of many people Barrack Obama is a ""god"".  I have to admit this since it has become evident.  I watched as one interviewer on an afternoon segment screech at a Trump surrogate ""It's not true!!!"" several times when referring to the fact that this stupid ""birther"" junk was the original work of Hillary Clinton.  Well, it was the handicraft of her minions to be sure, but this reporter sounded like a little girl repeating ""It's not true!"" six times, when it turns out he was telling the truth.  

So he is a ""god"" - to other people , not me or MY family but to others.  The fundamental change he promised has occurred. The collective ""we"" believe what he ""tells"" us rather than what we see with out ""lying eyes"".  Full employment is here!  Although 93 million are still out of work and workforce participation is 62%.  Largest wage increase since 2007! (And just in time for the next election).  Black men are being slaughtered in the streets by the police! Even though evidence proves this WRONG.  

Last week, the media protected and revered ""their god"" by ignoring all news (death, war, bad weather, crime, etc...) to focus on who had the temerity to offend their ""god"" by suggesting that he was not a true ""American"" that he was born in......  somewhere else but not the land of ""milk and honey"" ..... aka America.  Several of the top talkers on CNN looked as though their heads were going to spin on its axis while spitting green vomit.  Who could offend their ""god""!!!!

SO, through the media....... we are taught what he says is right, good and true and what ""they"" - anyone who is not an Obama.... says is ""bad"", ""not good"", dangerous, scary, etc.  So now, you are told :  "" it's a 'personal insult' if black voters don't back Clinton""

So, the ""black flock"" is now ordered to vote in a particular way.  Many of the press who want to be ""popular"" will follow their ""god"" to the ""promised land"" of a Hillary Clinton administration following the legacy of Obama and thus a third to infinity term.  

Can anyone be so cocksure of his own potency?  I won't tell you how I am voting, that is private, but this declaration of instruction by a sitting president to his loyal flock..... is .... unprecedented.  

Jeremiah 23:16

 16Thus says the LORD of hosts, ""Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you. They are leading you into futility; They speak a vision of their own imagination, Not from the mouth of the LORD.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1120324848048305/?type=3,2016-09-18 05:56:11,11,2,2,10,0,1,0,0,0

I  went to a funeral recently and I found myself tongue-tied.  All I could do was look sad (because I was sad especially for the family) but I have made up my mind that I would dispense with the cliche's and speak from the heart, when possible.  Problem was, using well known words and phrases are part of our culture.  Let's take a look at some ""empty"" phrases:

""She/He is in a better place.""

""Everything happens for a reason."" (especially empty since EVERYTHING does happen for a reason - i.e. you will drown if you jump into deep water without being able to swim; if you walk across the street you WILL arrive on the other side or get run over trying --- either way each occurrence had a ""reason"")

""God is still in control.""; ""God will provide.""; (not empty when it is truly meant but when used as a ""filler"".  

""Our thoughts are with you at this time of ______""  - You could fill in the blank with the words ""happiness"", ""need"", ""sadness"", ""joy"", ""grief"" etc.

""I feel your pain"" ----- In this case the sentiment is a lie since one can NOT feel another's pain, they can only feel empathy.

Would it not be better just to provide a hug, or something a bit more genuine than a well worn cliche?

The GOP did not leave Powell; he left the GOP after the party gave him fame and success. His lack of gratitude is appalling. His support of Obama was the last straw, If he had run for the nomination, he would have had the same level of success as Lindsey Graham.

Now the same country, China, is set to hold the World Dog Show.  My pampered babies and my little rescue sweetie are quite lucky indeed.  One greyhound screamed as he was lowed into the boiling stock pot.  Dogs are so close in temperament to human beings.... so wonderful....  My parent's little dog has his own little bed that he climbs on and pulls the covers over his body.  My handsome bullies spray each other with the water hose. 

But on the other hand.......Obviously cruel in their treatment of dogs, people, and the earth, but perhaps there's no better set of judges to determine levels of appreciation to a specific breed standard than someone who's licking their chops.ugh

428053320608798_1100435103370613,"As a person who must carry with them some type of Allergy pen in order to even eat in a restaurant......  Please read the followinng:

If you carry an EpiPen in case of a deadly allergic reaction, you've probably noticed the price skyrocket over the last decade. The injectors now cost over $600 and still expire after a year, so it may be tempting to carry an expired EpiPen, or none at all. There's an alternative, though: the Adrenaclick is a different device that delivers the same drug.

According to GoodRx, a two-pack of Adrenaclick injectors costs as little as $142 with a free coupon. That's still not cheap, but it helps. (GoodRx's prices include both name-brand Adrenaclick and its generic version.) The two devices work differently, though: for example, the Adrenaclick has two caps to remove, not one. Make sure you read the instructions. 

Since the devices are different, your pharmacist can't just substitute Adrenaclick if your prescription says EpiPen, so you'll need to ask your doctor to prescribe the one you want. You should also verify that Adrenaclick is covered under your insurance. Call the number on the back of your insurance card, and they should be able to tell you.

If you still want to stick with EpiPens, their maker, Mylan, is offering a coupon that knocks down your copay by $100. (They call it a ""$0 copay"" coupon, but read the fine print.) This lets them keep charging the higher price to insurance companies and to anyone without the coupon. It's a pretty standard page out of the drug company playbook, and it's totally legal.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1100435103370613/?type=3,2016-08-26 13:49:53,298,35,3772,219,2,8,0,4,65

428053320608798_1100155476731909,"What do you think? (After reading this)

I want your opinion, this article shows parents who simply ""opt out"" of doing what is requested by the teacher, thus signaling to the child a lack of respect for school authority and following the established classroom rules. These children will NOT be able to stay on par with their peers who will display a level of confidence and mastery of the information because they PRACTICED by doing homework. Falling behind, the child then loses confidence and begins to act out.

One of the things that these parents fail to understand is that these cute little ""cherubs"" in elementary school will one day be teenagers who will then, themselves, disobey the rules...... just as their parents did by ""simply opting out"" of a simple homework packet. They will ""simply opt out"" of maybe.... going to class, classroom rules or attending school altogether.....

Just as a ""simple candy sweet"" before bedtime will eventually contribute to a ""simple cavity""; ""simply opting out"" while your kid is cute, little and playful might contribute to other unwanted outcomes. Think about it......... drug abuse, delinquency, teen pregnancy and promiscuity, poor school performance, depression and anti-social behavior all begins with ""cute acts of defiance"".

Despite all the ooh-ing and ahh-ing by the media (Look how articulate Trump's children are! Oh, the boys are so polite! At least he has those kids!), this is not a good thing.

Children, no matter how hard-nosed, do not view parents (especially ones to whom they owe their lavish lifestyle) objectively. 

The kids, naturally, value the relationship with the parent more than victory. If given the choice between the two, they'll look to keep the relationship intact, even at the risk of countenancing disastrous campaign decisions.

With Hillary Clinton in the White House, there is no question whatever that she will nominate candidates for the Supreme Court who will destroy both the First Amendment right to free speech and the Second Amendment right to armed self-protection. And that will undoubtedly be just the beginning of the dismantling of the Constitution.

Are they listening?????  Their First Amendment Rights will be GONE.  Second Amendment Rights will be GONE.   AND your individual freedom - GONE.

I realize that some of the Knock-offs are not so great, HOWEVER, the models ---- especially those from Asian countries are small...... very small.......  My youngest daughter got two of the dresses below and one was actually a little big but they were perfect as far as the length.  If the model is a perfect size 2 and you are a perfect size 12, the fit is going to be different......  

Remember:  Yes, some of the dresses are horrendous. But ladies, if you see a size 2 model in a dress and you're a size 14, you gotta realize that it isn't going to look the same......  just like the shoe in the window of a shoe store is a size 6.5 narrow.  The 9.5 medium might look like a whoe different mule.

He is better associated with the World Cup and professional football which shouldn't really be part of the Olympics in my opinion anyway. There are plenty other Brazilian sportsmen who can take part instead. It would of course be great to see him sitting up in the stands during the closing moments, but only if he is happy and up for that.

428053320608798_1085998171480973,"Today in History:

1925  The first national congress of the Ku Klux Klan opens. 

The Ku Klux Klan (KKK), or simply ""the Klan"", is the name of three distinct past and present movements in the United States that have advocated extremist reactionary currents such as white supremacy, white nationalism, anti-immigration, and, especially in later iterations, Nordicism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-Semitism,historically expressed through terrorism aimed at groups or individuals whom they opposed. All three movements have called for the ""purification"" of American society, and all are considered right wing extremist organizations.

The first Klan flourished in the Southern United States in the late 1860s, then died out by the early 1870s. It sought to overthrow the Republican state governments in the South during the Reconstruction Era, especially by using violence against African American leaders. With numerous chapters across the South, it was suppressed around 1871, through federal law enforcement. Members made their own, often colorful, costumes: robes, masks, and conical hats, designed to be terrifying, and to hide their identities

The second group was founded in 1915, and flourished nationwide in the early and mid-1920s, particularly in urban areas of the Midwest and West. It opposed Catholics and Jews, especially newer immigrants, and stressed opposition to the Catholic Church. This second organization adopted a standard white costume and used similar code words as the first Klan, while adding cross burnings and mass parades.

The third and current manifestation of the KKK emerged after 1950, in the form of small, local, unconnected groups that use the KKK name. They focused on opposition to the Civil Rights Movement, often using violence and murder to suppress activists. It is classified as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. As of 2016, the Anti-Defamation League puts total Klan membership nationwide at around 3,000 while the Southern Poverty Law Center puts it at 6,000 members total.

The second and third incarnations of the Ku Klux Klan made frequent references to America's ""Anglo-Saxon"" blood, hearkening back to 19th-century nativism. Although members of the KKK swear to uphold Christian morality, virtually every Christian denomination has officially denounced the KKK.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1085998171480973/?type=3,2016-08-08 15:04:51,9,2,4,8,0,1,0,0,0

And now several decades later, Sophia Loren is recalling fond memories of how she fell in love with the most important man in her life, late husband Carlo Ponti, who was 22 years older than the screen siren.
In the November 24 issue of Closer Weekly, new excerpts from the 80-year-old's memoir Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow: My Life revealed the Houseboat star never knew her own father but found a paternal figure in Carlo writing, 'it was the dream of my life to have a father... I married an older man like him.'

 She was a struggling actress known as Sofia Lazzaro before changing her moniker to Sophia Loren, shortly after meeting her longtime partner Carlo at a small town beauty pageant in 1950.
'By that time whenever I went out it was with Carlo,' she reminisced in her autobiographical book. 'True, he was married and we had to be careful, only later would our fondness turn into love.'
He helped launch her career as a sought-after star when the Italian film producer casted her in some of her first starring roles in Anna and I Dream Of Zorro.

Michael Jordan Speaks......

In his hometown of Chicago, Blacks kill Blacks at alarming rates.  It is practically Murder Inc. in Chicago-land.  

In fact, according to FBI data, 4,906 black people murdered other blacks in 2010 and 2011. That is 1,460 more black Americans killed by other blacks in two years than were lynched from 1882 to 1968, according to the Tuskegee Institute.

In 2012, white males were 38 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders.

In other words: black people–at just a fifth of the size–committed almost 1,000 more murders than their white counterparts.

There have been almost as many deaths in one American city as there have been in the two major wars carried out by the U.S. military this century.

Chicago's death toll from 2001–November, 26 2015 stands at 7,401. The combined total deaths during Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003-2015: 4,815) and Operation Enduring Freedom/Afghanistan (2001-2015: 3,506), total 8,321.

Bottom line, Michael Jordan is being hailed as ""brave"", He is not,,,,,, he just jumped on the bandwagon because this is just another fact:

""It would take cops 40 years to kill as many black men as have died at the hands of others black men in 2012 alone.""

Regarding Michael Jordan's father:

On July 23, 1993, while returning from a funeral, eight days before his 57th birthday, Michael Jordan sr. pulled over on US Highway 74 just south of Lumberton, North Carolina, to take a nap. Daniel Andre Green and Larry Martin Demery spotted the car, a red Lexus SC400 with the North Carolina license plate that read ""UNC0023"", Michael had recently purchased for him.[5] Green and Demery shot Jordan to death while he slept in his car, then stole the vehicle. His body was found on August 3 in a swamp in Bennettsville, South Carolina, and because it was extremely decomposed, it was not positively identified until August 13.

After going through Jordan's belongings, Green and Demery realized that Jordan Sr. was the father of Michael Jordan. They had taken other items from the car, including two NBA championship rings given to Jordan Sr. by his son. Green and Demery made several calls from Jordan's cell phone and as a result were immediately captured. After their arrest, Demery said that they had planned only to tie up their victim and that Green pulled the trigger for no reason. Both were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for this and other violent crimes. James Jordan was buried at Rockfish AME Church in Teachey, North Carolina, on August 15, 1993

With the introduction of Photoshop in the 1990s, Tuschman turned to photography, developing a style that incorporates techniques of graphic design, painting, and assemblage. In his words, ""Photoshop came naturally to me, and seemed much more analogous to painting and printmaking (which was good for me) than a traditional darkroom. After that, my career in photo-illustration took off."" His commissioned work appears on book covers and in magazines and advertisements.

Very different pictures have emerged of Michael Brown, the unarmed teen shot dead by Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri

Family tell MailOnline the video of him in suspected robbery was 'completely out of character'

Michael had just won a place at college, because his mother 'was constantly on him'. As a reward, she told him 'do what he wanted' during summer 

His father pleaded guilty to felony drug possession in 2007
Teen had aspirations to be a rapper and posted his songs to the internet 

He sang about 'smoking weed since 9', the 'Feds' and getting out of 'the hood'. He also rapped about Swishers - the cigars he allegedly stole

A few weeks before his death he told relative: 'Everybody in the world is going to know my name' 

In her memoir, Tell the truth & Shame the Devil: The Life, Legacy and Love of My Son Michael Brown, McSpadden, 36, says that her life was troubled from the start.

She was raised in a single-parent home and her mother worked more than one job to support McSpadden and her brother and sister.

She moved out of home for a while and lived with her grandmother, got into fights and was once threatened with a gun on her porch.

McSpadden never finished high school, something she admits is one of the most 'uncomfortable and embarrassing facts about my life'.

The main reason was that at 16 she gave birth to Brown, whose full name is Michael Orlandus Darrion Brown, and whose father is Brown Sr.

McSpadden claims that from the one time she had sex with Brown, she lost her virginity and got pregnant.

It was over the Fourth of July weekend in 1997, just after Brown's first birthday, that his father hit McSpadden for the first time.
She writes that their relationship 'took a turn that shamed me to my core' when they fought about his friends firing fireworks at her while messing around.

428053320608798_1074444082636382,"Few Nigerians had heard little about Oresegun Olumide, a 35-year old Lagos artist who specializes in oil paintings. Since the start of the week though, his story and life, has changed. Oresegun's life-like art, which he describes as 'hyper reality', has gone viral across various social media platforms leaving many in awe.

Oresegun studied fine art at the Yaba College of Technology in Lagos and began painting professionally in 2008. In 2011 he held his first exhibition at a gallery in Ikorodu, a densely populated town in Lagos. Impressed by his work, the gallery hosted his second exhibition in 2014.

Having taken a break from public exhibitions to prepare for his third exhibition this year, Olumide decided to share two new paintings on his Facebook page last weekend. The impact was scarcely believable. Images of his work have been shared over 50,000 times on Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat and has trended worldwide. Though it is likely his work has been shared much more times by users taking images off his Facebook page.

He studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and later attended Académie Julian, Paris. After early figure-painting and illustration, he became prominent as a landscape painter. He was one of the Ten American Painters who in 1897 seceded from the Society of American Artists. For some years he was an instructor in the Womans Art School, Cooper Union, New York, and in the Art Students League, New York. In 1893 he became a member of the American Watercolor Society, New York. Generally associated with American Impressionism, he is also remembered for his New England landscapes and involvement with the Old Lyme Art Colony at Old Lyme, Connecticut and his influential years at the Cornish Art Colony.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1068039546610169/?type=3,2016-07-12 12:00:58,6,0,0,4,1,0,0,1,0

Travelling to the American West five times during the 1830s, Catlin was the first white man to depict Plains Indians in their native territory

George Catlin was born in Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. As a child growing up in Pennsylvania, Catlin had spent many hours hunting, fishing, and looking for American Indian artifacts. His fascination with Native Americans was kindled by his mother, who told him stories of the western frontier and how she was captured by a tribe when she was a young girl. Years later, a group of Native Americans came through Philadelphia dressed in their colorful outfits and made quite an impression on Catlin.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1067404476673676/?type=3,2016-07-11 12:27:18,8,0,2,8,0,0,0,0,0

After two failures in the Prix de Rome competition, in 1875 and 1876, Bastien-Lepage managed to establish an original body of work.
 He succeeded in looking at things from the side of the realists, his elders, as well as that of his contemporaries, the defenders of the new painting from which he took the light tones and the vibrant touch.

Bastien-Lepage devoted his short life to two types of subject: firstly to portraits, for which he had a loyal clientele among performers - from Sarah Bernhardt to Coquelin the elder - and among the republican middle class - from Simon Hayem to Leon Gambetta - and secondly, to rural subjects, often painted in the places of his childhood. He captivated the public at the Salon with The Hayfield (1877, Musée d'Orsay), Season of October (1878, Melbourne National Gallery of Victoria), with Père Jacques (1881, Milwaukee Art Center) and with Rural love (1882, Moscow, Pushkin Museum).

428053320608798_1055310421216415,"Lee Jeffries lives in Manchester in the United Kingdom. Close to the professional football circle, this artist starts to photograph sporting events. A chance meeting with a young homeless girl in the streets of London changes his artistic approach forever. Lee Jeffries recalls that, initially, he had stolen a photo from this young homeless girl huddled in a sleeping bag. The photographer knew that the young girl had noticed him but his first reaction was to leave. He says that something made him stay and go and discuss with the homeless girl. His perception about the homeless completely changes. They become the subject of his art. The models in his photographs are homeless people that he has met in Europe and in the United States: «Situations arose, and I made an effort to learn to get to know each of the subjects before asking their permission to do their portrait.» From then onwards, his photographs portray his convictions and his compassion to the world.

""If you will forgive my indulgence, This work is most definitely NOT photojournalism. Nor is it intended as portraiture. It's religious or spiritual iconography. It's powerful stuff. Jeffries gave these people something more than personal dignity. He gave them a light in their eyes that depicts transcendence, a glimmer of light at the gates of Eden, so to speak. The clarity in their eyes is awesome to behold, as if God is somewhere in there. He has made these people into more than poor old broken homeless people lazily waiting for a handout from some urbane and thoughtful corporate agent. He infused them with light, not darkness. Even the blind guy has light pouring from his sightless eyes. I think Jeffries intended his art to honor these people, not pity them. He honors those people by giving their likenesses a greater meaning. He gives them a religious spiritual significance. He imbues them with the iconic soul of humanity. I think that's what he was trying to do, at least to some degree thereof.""",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1055310421216415/?type=3,2016-06-22 13:46:04,33,11,9,31,2,0,0,0,0

Cameron's photographic career was short, spanning eleven years of her life (1864–1875). She took up photography at the relatively late age of 48, when she was given a camera as a present.[2] Her style was not widely appreciated in her own day: her choice to use a soft focus and to treat photography as an art as well as a science, by manipulating the wet collodion process, caused her works to be viewed as ""slovenly"", ""mistakes"" and bad photography. She found more acceptance among pre-Raphaelite artists than among photographers.[3] Her work has had an impact on modern photographers, especially her closely cropped portraits. Her house, Dimbola Lodge, on the Isle of Wight is open to the public.

The bulk of Cameron's photographs fit into two categories—closely framed portraits and illustrative allegories based on religious and literary works. In the allegorical works in particular, her artistic influence was clearly Pre-Raphaelite, with far-away looks, limp poses, and soft lighting

Cameron's sister ran the artistic scene at Little Holland House, which gave her many famous subjects for her portraits. Some of her famous subjects include: Charles Darwin, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, John Everett Millais, William Michael Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, Ellen Terry, and George Frederic Watts. Most of these distinctive portraits are cropped closely around the subject's face and are in soft focus. Often Cameron was a friend of these Victorian celebrities, and, knowing them well, tried to capture their personalities in her photographs. Among Cameron's lesser-known images are those she took of Mary Emily ('May') Prinsep, wife of Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson, the elder son of Alfred Tennyson and a British colonial administrator. Cameron's portraits of May Prinsep, taken on the Isle of Wight, show a somewhat plain woman shot head-on and without affect.

Cameron died while in Ceylon. Her death is attributed to having caught a bad chill and she died in Kalutara, Ceylon in 1879.

428053320608798_1049038461843611,"William Thomas Kinkade III (January 19, 1958 – April 6, 2012) was an American painter of popular realistic, pastoral, and idyllic subjects.[3] He is notable for the mass marketing of his work as printed reproductions and other licensed products via the Thomas Kinkade Company. He characterized himself as ""Thomas Kinkade, Painter of Light,"" a phrase he protected through trademark but one originally attributed to the British master J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851).It has been estimated that 1 in every 20 American homes owns a copy of one of his paintings.

Despite wide commercial success throughout his life, Kinkade is generally held in low esteem by art critics; his pastoral paintings have been described as maudlin and overly sentimental.

Kinkade's production method has been described as ""a semi-industrial process in which low-level apprentices embellish a prefab base provided by Kinkade.""[16] Kinkade reportedly designed and painted all of his works, which were then moved into the next stage of the process of mass-producing prints. It is assumed he had a hand in most of the original, conceptual work that he produced. However, he also employed a number of studio assistants to help create multiple prints of his famous oils. Thus while it is believed that Kinkade designed and painted all of his original paintings, the ones collectors were likely to own were printed factory-like and touched up with manual brush strokes by someone other than Kinkade.

Kinkade is reportedly one of the most counterfeited artists, due in large part to advances in affordable, high resolution digital photography and printing technology. Additionally, mass-produced hand-painted fakes from countries like China and Thailand abound in the U.S. and around the globe. In 2011, the Kinkade studio said that Kinkade was the most collected artist in Asia but received no income from those regions due to widespread forgery.

The Los Angeles Times reported that some of Kinkade's former colleagues, employees, and even collectors of his work said that he had a long history of cursing and heckling other artists and performers. The Times further reported that he openly fondled a woman's breasts at a South Bend, Indiana, sales event, and mentioned his proclivity for ritual territory marking through urination, once relieving himself on a Winnie the Pooh figure at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim while saying, ""This one's for you, Walt.""

Kinkade died in his Monte Sereno, California home on April 6, 2012. It was reported following autopsy that he died of ""acute intoxication"" from alcohol and Valium.He was 54 years old.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1049038461843611/?type=3,2016-06-12 12:38:37,29,1,1,25,3,1,0,0,0

428053320608798_1046686615412129,"Lillian Bassman (June 15, 1917 – February 13, 2012) was an American photographer and painter.  Her parents were Jewish intellectuals who emigrated to the United States from Ukraine (then in Russia) in 1905 and settled in Brooklyn, New York. She grew up in Brooklyn and Greenwich Village, New York,and studied at the Textile High School in Manhattan with Alexey Brodovitch and graduated in 1933.

She first met her future husband, photographer Paul Himmel (born 1914), at Coney Island at age six. They met again at 13, and started living together when she was 15. They were married in 1935; Himmel died in 2009 after 73 years of marriage.

From the 1940s until the 1960s Bassman worked as a fashion photographer for Junior Bazaar and later at Harper's Bazaar[3] where she promoted the careers of photographers such as Richard Avedon, Robert Frank, Louis Faurer and Arnold Newman. Under the guidance of the Russian emigrant, Alexey Brodovitch, she began to photograph her model subjects primarily in black and white. Her work was published for the most part in Harper's Bazaar from 1950 to 1965.
By the 1970s Bassman's interest in pure form in her fashion photography was out of vogue. She turned to her own photo projects and abandoned fashion photography. In doing so she tossed out 40 years of negatives and prints - her life's work. A forgotten bag filled with hundreds of images was discovered over 20 years later. Bassman's fashion photographic work began to be re-appreciated in the 1990s.
She worked with digital technology and abstract color photography into her 90s to create a new series of work. She used Photoshop for her image manipulation.
The most notable qualities about her photographic work are the high contrasts between light and dark, the graininess of the finished photos, and the geometric placement and camera angles of the subjects. Bassman became one of the last great woman photographers in the world of fashion.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1046686615412129/?type=3,2016-06-08 19:29:26,17,0,3,16,1,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_1033176703429787,"Jasper Johns:  Veteran of the Korean War, Painter, American, and Gay.

Born in Augusta, Georgia, Jasper Johns spent his early life in Allendale, South Carolina, with his paternal grandparents after his parents' marriage failed. He then spent a year living with his mother in Columbia, South Carolina, and thereafter he spent several years living with his aunt Gladys in Lake Murray, South Carolina, twenty-two miles from Columbia. He completed Edmunds High School (class of 1947) in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother.  Recounting this period in his life, he once said, ""In the place where I was a child, there were no artists and there was no art, so I really didn't know what that meant. I think I thought it meant that I would be in a situation different than the one that I was in.""

Johns studied a total of three semesters at the University of South Carolina, from 1947 to 1948. He then moved to New York City and studied briefly at the Parsons School of Design in 1949. In 1952 and 1953 he was stationed in Sendai, Japan, during the Korean War.

In 1954, after returning to New York, Johns met Robert Rauschenberg and they became long-term lovers. For a time they lived in the same building as Rachel Rosenthal. In the same period he was strongly influenced by the gay couple Merce Cunningham (a choreographer) and John Cage (a composer).  Working together they explored the contemporary art scene, and began developing their ideas on art. In 1958, gallery owner Leo Castelli discovered Johns while visiting Rauschenberg's studio. Castelli gave him his first solo show. It was here that Alfred Barr, the founding director of New York's Museum of Modern Art, purchased four works from this show.  In 1963, Johns and Cage founded Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, now known as Foundation for Contemporary Arts in New York City.

Johns currently lives in Sharon, Connecticut, and on the Island of Saint Martin. Until 2012, he lived in a rustic 1930s farmhouse with a glass-walled studio in Stony Point, New York. He first began visiting St. Martin in the late 1960s and bought the property there in 1972. The architect Philip Johnson is the principal designer of his home, a long, white, rectangular structure divided into three distinct sections.

Johns is best known for his painting Flag (1954–55), which he painted after having a dream of the American flag. His work is often described as Neo-Dadaist, as opposed to pop art, even though his subject matter often includes images and objects from popular culture.

Since the 1980s, Johns typically produces only four to five paintings a year; some years he produces none. His large-scale paintings are much favored by collectors and because of their rarity are extremely difficult to acquire. His works from the mid to late 1950s, typically viewed as his period of rebellion against abstract expressionism, remain his most sought after. Skate's Art Market Research (Skate Press, Ltd.), a New York-based advisory firm servicing private and institutional investors in the art market, has ranked Jasper Johns as the 30th most valuable artist in the world.

n 1980 the Whitney Museum of American Art paid $1 million for Three Flags (1958), then the highest price ever paid for the work of a living artist.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1033176703429787/?type=3,2016-05-17 13:44:06,20,0,10,17,3,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_1030421190372005,"Virginia Slims is a brand of cigarette manufactured by Altria Group (formerly Phillip Morris Companies). The brand was introduced in 1968 and marketed to young professional women using the slogan ""You've come a long way, baby.""  Later campaigns have used the slogans, ""It's a woman thing,"" in the 1990s, and ""Find your voice.""

Additionally, marketing for Virginia Slims harnesses the power of fashion. Many print advertisements portray women in fashion-forward outfits and make references to fashion: ""I'm a skyhigh pair of platforms in a closet full of flats,"" an ad from 2001 boasts. The cigarettes themselves are longer and narrower than average cigarettes, reflected by the name ""Slims."" This adoption of the word ""slim"" and indeed, sometimes even ""superslim,"" is a clear reference to a woman's figure. A slim, slender figure is often presented as more desirable in women's fashion magazines and by models in the fashion industry. The Virginia Slims brand portrays a subliminal, indirect message that Virginia Slims cigarettes will result in its smokers obtaining or maintaining a slim figure.

One of the most famous advertising campaigns in US history launched on this day in 1968:  ""You've come a long way"" (sometimes with ""baby"" added at the end) was the provocative tagline for a new, thinner cigarette produced by the Phillip Morris Company and marketed specifically to women.  The campaign, developed by the famed Leo Burnett Agency, was wildly successful, both in commercial (it sold a lot of cigarettes) and cultural terms, becoming almost instantly a national catch-phrase.  

The campaign traded on-- one might have said ""co-opted"" in the 1960s-- the emerging feminist consciousness and the rise of  ""the New Woman,"" a woman who was independent, self-sufficient, and eager to demonstrate her confidence.  At the same time, imagery in the ads linked this sassy confidence with U.S. women's history (itself an emerging field in academe)  in contrasting the freedom and glamour of today's woman with the drudgery and repression that women in the past had endured.  

It was all very clever-- and Phillip Morris knew they had a winner right away.  An in-house corporate study from 1986 touted Virginia Slims' ""brand personality"" as the key to its success.  Contrasting the brand with ""women's"" brands produced by PM competitors, such as ""Eve"" and ""Satin,""  Phillip Morris said the Virginia Slims brand was ""feminine but non-threatening.  It was 'user-friendly.'  The women were women who could make choices but had not lost their femininity.  The brand was aspirational.""  

""Aspirational""-- and also, like all other cigarettes-- addictive and lethal.  The Virginia Slims campaign was widely credited-- ""blamed"" may be more appropriate-- for convincing thousands of teenage girls to take up smoking as a sexy, free-wheeling and .....  even revolutionary act.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1030421190372005/?type=3,2016-05-12 22:34:43,12,3,1,11,0,0,0,0,1

428053320608798_1029418450472279,"JIm Crow?  Really?????

Shortly after the DOJ filed a lawsuit against North Carolina over its bathroom bill, Attorney General Loretta Lynch spoke out at a press conference and likened it to similar ways civil rights have been trampled on before.

""We saw it in the Jim Crow laws that followed the Emancipation Proclamation,"" Lynch said. ""We saw it in the fierce and widespread resistance to Brown v. Board of Education.""

I notice that anytime the left wants to make a point they try to conjure up visions of ""Jim Crow"", ""Hitler"", ""Fascists"" or whatever boogeyman they can find to make their point.  In doing so, as in the case of the ""Toilet Wars of 2016"", they minimize the horror that embodied that era and usher in inaccuracies to bolster their point, no matter how trivial.  So..... what were the Jim Crow laws?

Jim Crow was the name of the racial caste system which operated primarily, but not exclusively in southern and border states, between 1877 and the mid-1960s. Jim Crow was more than a series of rigid anti-black laws. It was a way of life. Under Jim Crow, African Americans were relegated to the status of second class citizens. Jim Crow represented the legitimization of anti-black racism. Many Christian ministers and theologians taught that whites were the Chosen people, blacks were cursed to be servants, and God supported racial segregation. Craniologists, eugenicists, phrenologists, and Social Darwinists, at every educational level, buttressed the belief that blacks were innately intellectually and culturally inferior to whites. 

Pro-segregation politicians gave eloquent speeches on the great danger of integration: the mongrelization of the white race. Newspaper and magazine writers routinely referred to blacks as niggers, coons, and darkies; and worse, their articles reinforced anti-black stereotypes. Even children's games portrayed blacks as inferior beings (see ""From Hostility to Reverence: 100 Years of African-American Imagery in Games""). All major societal institutions reflected and supported the oppression of blacks.
 The Jim Crow system was undergirded by the following beliefs or rationalizations: whites were superior to blacks in all important ways, including but not limited to intelligence, morality, and civilized behavior; sexual relations between blacks and whites would produce a mongrel race which would destroy America; treating blacks as equals would encourage interracial sexual unions; any activity which suggested social equality encouraged interracial sexual relations; if necessary, violence must be used to keep blacks at the bottom of the racial hierarchy. The following Jim Crow etiquette norms show how inclusive and pervasive these norms were:

A black male could not offer his hand (to shake hands) with a white male because it implied being socially equal. Obviously, a black male could not offer his hand or any other part of his body to a white woman, because he risked being accused of rape.
 

Blacks and whites were not supposed to eat together. If they did eat together, whites were to be served first, and some sort of partition was to be placed between them.
 

Under no circumstance was a black male to offer to light the cigarette of a white female -- that gesture implied intimacy.
 

Blacks were not allowed to show public affection toward one another in public, especially kissing, because it offended whites.
 

Jim Crow etiquette prescribed that blacks were introduced to whites, never whites to blacks. For example: ""Mr. Peters (the white person), this is Charlie (the black person), that I spoke to you about.""
 

Whites did not use courtesy titles of respect when referring to blacks, for example, Mr., Mrs., Miss., Sir, or Ma'am. Instead, blacks were called by their first names. Blacks had to use courtesy titles when referring to whites, and were not allowed to call them by their first names.
 

If a black person rode in a car driven by a white person, the black person sat in the back seat, or the back of a truck.
 

White motorists had the right-of-way at all intersections.
Stetson Kennedy, the author of Jim Crow Guide (1990), offered these simple rules that blacks were supposed to observe in conversing with whites:

Never assert or even intimate that a white person is lying.
Never impute dishonorable intentions to a white person.
Never suggest that a white person is from an inferior class.
Never lay claim to, or overly demonstrate, superior knowledge or intelligence.
Never curse a white person.
Never laugh derisively at a white person.
Never comment upon the appearance of a white female.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1029418367138954/?type=3,2016-05-11 05:53:45,31,23,12,20,1,2,1,1,6

The museum, which has been open for a number of years but finally received an official government license last spring, is a labor of love. Its owner, Yang Peiming, began buying up the posters in the mid-1990s as they were being thrown away en masse.

""The propaganda poster is very, very unique,"" says Yang. ""They describe the history with so many detailed pictures. This is interesting, because it is art plus politics.""
Many posters feature heroic, cartoonlike figures with political slogans to rally the masses. The images are triumphant, even if the events they depict were often disasters.

Take a poster from 1958 showing a Chinese man on horseback racing past a portly British soldier in a pith helmet on the back of an ox. One of the poster's slogans says China's economy will surpass Great Britain's in 15 years. The poster was a rallying cry for Mao's Great Leap Forward, which forcibly collectivized agriculture.

The official observance of Mother's Day in its present form is credited to Anna Jarvis (1864-1948) of Philadelphia, PA. She wanted to honor the memory of her mother, Mrs. Ann Marie Reeves Jarvis, who died in 1905. Before getting into the story, it's important to clear up two popular misconceptions. According to historical records provided by the curator at the Anna Jarvis Birthplace Museum near Grafton, WV, Anna Jarvis' mother was not, as is popularly believed, also named Anna. Her mother was simply Ann. Second, Anna Jarvis' name has no middle initial.

Mrs. Ann Marie Reeves Jarvis (sometimes referred to as ""Mother Jarvis"" to distinguish her from her daughter Anna) organized several ""Mothers Day Work Clubs"" in the 1850s in the West Virginia area (the name of the clubs was later changed to ""Mothers Friendship Clubs""). Mrs. Jarvis lost eight children under the age of seven (she gave birth to a total of twelve children), and wanted to combat the poor health and sanitation conditions that existed in many areas and contributed to the high mortality rate of children. The social action brigades provided medicine for the poor, nursing care for the sick, and arranged help and proper medical care for those ill with tuberculosis.

At the beginning of the Civil War, Mrs. Jarvis called together four of her Clubs and asked them to make a pledge that friendship and goodwill would not be a victim of the conflict between the states. In a display of compassion, courage, and friendship, the members of these Clubs nursed soldiers from both sides and saved many lives.

After the Civil War, Mrs. Jarvis worked as a peacemaker encouraging families to set aside differences created by the polarization of the war. In 1868, she organized a ""Mothers Friendship Day"" to bring together families that had been divided by the conflict. Mrs. Jarvis spoke about the purpose of the day:

To revive the dormant filial love and gratitude we owe to those who gave us birth. To be a home tie for the absent. To obliterate family estrangement. To create a bond of brotherhood through the wearing of a floral badge. To make us better children by getting us closer to the hearts of our good mothers. To brighten the lives of good mothers. To have them know we appreciate them, though we do not show it as often as we ought... Mothers Day is to remind us of our duty before it is too late. This day is intended that we may make new resolutions for a more active thought to our dear mothers. By words, gifts, acts of affection, and in every way possible, give her pleasure, and make her heart glad every day, and constantly keep in memory Mothers Day.

If friends and family were to be reconnected, Mrs. Jarvis believed it had to be done by appealing to that love and respect that everyone has for their mother. With great skill and courage, she created a very emotional event, with many people embracing and in tears at the end. Several other Mothers Friendship Days were held thereafter.

Mrs. Jarvis' service to her community was not lost on her daughter, Anna. When her mother passed away, Anna was at her graveside and recalled something her mother often said:

I hope that someone, sometime, will found a Memorial Mothers Day commemorating her for the matchless service she renders to humanity in every field of life. She is entitled to it. 

Then and there, Anna made a promise to her mother:

The time and place is here and the someone is your daughter, and by the grace of God, you shall have that Mothers Day. 

Up until her own death, Anna continually referred to her mother as the real originator of Mother's Day, despite the fact that it was Anna herself who worked tirelessly over several years to make it a national reality.

It began in 1907 when Anna had a small gathering of friends in her home to commemorate her mother's life. She announced the idea of a national day to honor mothers. In 1908, Anna persuaded her mother's church in Grafton, WV to celebrate Mother's Day on the anniversary of her mother's death, the second Sunday of May. It was to be a day to honor all mothers, and also a day to remember the work of peacemaking, reconciliation, and social action against poverty started by her mother. That same year, Mother's Day was also celebrated in Philadelphia.

The role of women was changing rapidly during this period. During the first two decades of the 1900s (often referred to as the Progressive Era), women were entering into community building and political activities. Like other women of the time, Anna did not denigrate the role of mother, wife, and homemaker, but expanded the role into the public arena. Women saw government as being ""enlarged housekeeping"" and used their skills to help improve it. The definition of motherhood at the time gave women a moral responsibility outside their immediate home. Women who participated in civil rights and welfare reform saw this work as essentially maternal in nature. Women worked to ease social ills; they became scholars and scientists; they fought for the rights of various groups of people; and they raised their voices to have the right to vote. Many of these reformers were mothers as well as activists, but their contributions as mothers were often overlooked. The creation of Mother's Day as a national holiday was to restore the status of mother as a cornerstone of the family and of the nation.

Anna and her supporters tirelessly wrote to ministers, business people, and politicians in their quest to establish a national Mother's Day to honor all mothers. By 1911, Mother's Day was celebrated in almost every state. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson made it official: Mother's Day would be a national holiday held each year on the second Sunday in May. He stated that mothers were ""the greatest source of the country's strength and inspiration."" He ordered the United States flag displayed on all public buildings to honor mothers. Unfortunately, many officials of the time turned the intent of the holiday away from women's activism and instead emphasized women's role in the home and family. The apostrophe was moved so that ""Mothers' Day"" as a day for organized social and political action by all mothers became ""Mother's Day"" a day for celebrating the private service of one's own particular mother.

Anna went on to incorporate herself as the Mother's Day International Association and turned her attention to persuading other nations to celebrate Mother's Day. Eventually, Mother's Day would be observed in over fifty countries.

It was Anna Jarvis who also began the custom of wearing a carnation on Mother's Day – colored if your mother is living, and white if she's not. It was intended to be a simple, inexpensive symbol of love and respect for the person who loved you before you even knew how to spell the word.

Unfortunately, the story of Anna Jarvis has a bittersweet ending. At first, people observed Mother's Day by attending church, writing letters to their mothers, and spending time together. As the years passed though, more people began buying cards, presents, and flowers. Anna felt that Mother's Day became much too commercialized. She was outraged when the price of carnations rose significantly and attacked florists as ""profiteers."" She filed a lawsuit to stop a 1923 Mother's Day festival and was even arrested for disturbing the peace at a war mothers' convention where women were selling carnations to raise money. Said Anna: ""This is not what I intended. I wanted a day of sentiment, not profit.""

Years later, in a care home, Anna told a reporter that she was sorry she had ever started Mother's Day. And yet, even though she had never had children herself, she was the mother of Mother's Day, and each Mother's Day her room would be filled with thousands of letters and cards from all over the world. One of them she prized highly, and hung on her wall. It read: ""I am six years old and I love my mother very much. I am sending you this because you started Mother's Day."" Carefully sewn to this letter from a little boy was a $1 bill.

Anna Jarvis died in 1948, at the age of 84.

Mother's Day is the legacy of Anna Jarvis and her mother Ann Jarvis.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1027492747331516/?type=3,2016-05-07 21:45:42,6,3,2,5,1,0,0,0,0

Bastien-Lepage was born in the village of Damvillers, Meuse, and spent his childhood there. Bastien's father grew grapes in a vineyard to support the family. His grandfather also lived in the village; his garden had fruit trees of apple, pear, and peach up against the high walls. Bastien took an early liking to drawing, and his parents fostered his creativity by buying prints of paintings for him to copy.

He died fairly young, even for those times.  Between 1880 and 1883 he traveled in Italy. The artist, long ailing, had tried in vain to re-establish his health in Algiers. He died in Paris in 1884, when planning a new series of rural subjects. His friend, Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch, was with him at the end and wrote,
""At last he was unable to work anymore; and he died on the 10th of December, 1884, breathing his last in my arms.

He also exhibited with the short-lived group known as ""The Eight,"" who protested the restrictive exhibition policies of the powerful, conservative National Academy of Design. He is best known for his robust paintings of urban life in New York and London, a hallmark of Ashcan art, and for his theater and residential murals and interior-design projects.

A key component of the history of the American quilt was the arrival of enslaved Africans to America. They brought the customs, signs and symbols of their culture, which included textiles and fabrics. African textiles have large asymmetric designs that ensure the pattern can be recognized from a distance and in the glare of sunlight; as well as sharply contrasting colors which enhance the visibility of both the cloth and the symbolic patterns. Asymmetrical deviations in the patterns are designed to confuse the path of evil spirits. In West Africa, strip weaving is the fabric construction process most used, where thin lines of fabric, which consist of symbols and patterns, are stitched together to make a wider cloth. Abstract, figurative and geometric designs portraying secret tribal symbols are incorporated into textiles, which can be seen in the Starch-resist dyed Adire cloth from Yorubaland, Nigeria.

In America, the traditional woven strips were substituted by fabric pieces and the subversive nature of African coded language continued. This enabled Africans to remember their roots and combined tribal histories, as seen in this piece by Harriet Powers. Although very few slave quilts have survived, two bible quilts made by Harriet Powers hang in the Smithsonian Institute.

428053320608798_1022881351125989,"Clarence Hudson White (April 8, 1871 – July 7, 1925) was an American photographer, teacher and a founding member of the Photo-Secession movement. He grew up in small towns in Ohio, where his primary influences were his family and the social life of rural America. After visiting the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, he took up photography. Although he was completely self-taught in the medium, within a few years he was internationally known for his pictorial photographs that captured the spirit and sentimentality of America in the early twentieth century. As he became well known for his images, White was sought out by other photographers who often traveled to Ohio to learn from him. He became friends with Alfred Stieglitz and helped advance the cause of photography as a true art form. In 1906 White and his family moved to New York City in order to be closer to Stieglitz and his circle and to further promote his own work. While there he became interested in teaching photography and in 1914 he established the Clarence H. White School of Photography, the first educational institution in America to teach photography as art. Due to the demands of his teaching duties, his own photography declined and White produced little new work during the last decade of his life. In 1925 he suffered a heart attack and died while teaching students in Mexico City.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1022881351125989/?type=3,2016-04-30 08:00:08,15,2,4,14,1,0,0,0,0

James Naismith (November 6, 1861 – November 28, 1939) was a Canadian-American physical educator, physician, chaplain, sports coach and innovator. He invented the sport of basketball in 1891. He wrote the original basketball rulebook, founded the University of Kansas basketball program, and lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the birth of both the National Invitation Tournament (1938) and the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship (1939).

Born in Canada, Naismith studied physical education in Montreal before moving to the United States, where he developed basketball in late 1891 while teaching at the International YMCA Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Naismith studied medicine in Denver, receiving his MD in 1898 before moving to the University of Kansas. After a decade (1898–1907) serving there as a faculty member and part-time basketball coach during the sport's fledgling years, he became the Kansas Jayhawks' athletic director. He became a U.S. citizen in 1925 in Lawrence, Kansas

Naismith's contributions to basketball have earned him several posthumous honors, such as in the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame, the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame, the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame, the NAIA Hall of Fame, and the FIBA Hall of Fame. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, where he is a member of the original Hall of Fame class, was named in Naismith's honor.

Naismith was also a National Guard chaplain with the First Kansas Infantry Regiment. He taught his soldiers basketball to control their excess energy. His effort helped increase morale and even lowered the rate of disciplinary actions among soldiers.

Ted Cruz is a Republican politician who is also from Canada.  He recently raised eyebrows by describing the big thing 10 feet in the air at the end of the court a ""basketball ring."" There are a lot of words I've heard used to describe that thing you shoot the ball into: Hoop, basket, bucket, tin, iron, so on and so forth. In the Hoosiers scene, Dale calls it a ""goal,"" which is old-timey, but accurate. Cruz could've called it a ""net"" and it wouldn't have been totally accurate, since that's not the metal part, but we would've understood. Perhaps Cruz was trying to say ""rim"" and his tongue slipped. But he said ""ring,"" which is not something anybody calls it.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1020930461321078/?type=3,2016-04-27 12:16:29,8,1,4,7,1,0,0,0,0

Instead, I ended up helping my parents run a business - and after losing both my mom and dad - I became the owner. My shop is now in its 30th year and thanks to an outstanding staff, I'm now able to step back and paint most of the week.
After 15+ years of not doing any art, in 2004 I started painting. I sold enough on eBay to build a studio in my back yard - then began using oils for the first time.
That lead to selling more paintings on eBay - then a year later I entered work in a gallery. A year later, I entered into another gallery, then another. Now I'm in
a comfortable place - doing larger works for those three galleries while I continue to paint small pieces that frequently auction on eBay.
I take my camera everywhere, paint from those photos - moments in time, people just doing their thing.
That's about it. Thanks for your interest.
I do appreciate it.''

""On March 3, 2005, Goodman spoke to a group of fourth-graders at Jo Mackey Elementary School. When asked what he would take with him if marooned on a desert island, the mayor replied, ""A bottle of Bombay Sapphire Gin and a pretty woman."" When asked about his hobbies, the mayor named drinking Bombay Sapphire Gin as a favorite.

 Later, when asked to comment about his statements, Goodman was unapologetic: ""I'm the George Washington of mayors. I can't tell a lie. If they didn't want the answer, the kid shouldn't have asked the question."" This caused an outcry from parents whose children heard the remark, and school officials said the remark was inappropriate.""

""GETTING THAT WELFARE DRINKING THAT WINE SITTING ON THERE FAT ASS , MUST BE REPUBLICANS.""

Excuse the grammatical errors, he must have been angry.  I looked at his page and realized that he often likes to refer to ""others"" as ""racist"" and bigots......  But of course HE is ""not"", in his world since he is a liberal.  And as a ""liberal"" he owns Black people and other minorities.  So because of this ownership he feels it is his right to criticize any one of them who might stray from the liberal plantation.  His assumptions regarding ""welfare"" and the right he feels to comment on her ""ass"" are both a part of his ""liberal rights"".

So, let me give some information to Mr. Colegrove  regarding Diamond and Silk:

""Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known by their stage name Diamond and Silk are an American duo mainly active as video bloggers and YouTube personalities. Hardaway and her co-host Richardson are former Democrats. The duo came to wider prominence in 2015 as supporters of conservative Presidential candidate Donald Trump after posting a video criticizing Fox News host Megyn Kelly for asking irrelevant questions during the first GOP candidate debate.[1] While they are not formally affiliated with the Trump campaign or paid by it, they have been urging other supporters of Trump to follow suit on social media and at rallies.[2]
They have also created a ""ditch and switch"" website explaining to voters which states are closed primaries and when the deadlines are for changing party affiliations.[2] They are biological sisters from North Carolina who say they stand with the silent majority, voicing their opinions about ""media bias, political babble, and repetitive political tactics that they feel the average American is tired of being subjected to.""[3]
The duo first joined Donald Trump as the Stump for Trump Girls on stage at his Raleigh, North Carolina rally on December 4, 2015.[4] They later riled up the crowd at the Trump rally on January 2, 2016, in Biloxi, Mississippi.""

A number of you have questioned as to whether or not this site is pro-Trump or anti everyone else, however, if you are regular readers of this site, and I know i don't have many ----- someone reminded me that Ben Shapiro has far more followers than I do..... which I really don't mind, then you will realize that I originally championed the candidacy of Ted Cruz.  

That is no longer the case - just being honest.  I admire Cruz's ability to understand and defend the Constitution and conservative values. However, I also see his inability to work with others as well as his ""Sherman's March"" approach to winning at all cost. The fact that he will one day have to work with his enemies (of his own making) fails to dawn on him. He is not winning the majority of Republican votes, how his supporters expect him to win the independent vote he needs to pull off a Presidential bid is beyond me. 

Look around and see where the country's mindset is. Do you think a nation that put Obama in office twice, and that thinks the height of entertainment is reality TV is going to put a ""strict conservative"" with th inability to connect with anyone , much less the ""average Joe"" in office? I don't see it, his chances, or his ability to work with others to inspire me.  As it appears, to know Ted Cruz is not to love, like or trust Ted Cruz.  In addition, if you take off the rosy glasses, you will discover that he is a narrow regional candidate, at best.  

In years past, we have fooled ourselves and now if we continue to trick ourselves into believing that (1) Cruz who has narrow regional appeal will somehow magically entrance moderate, socially liberal or people with a loose knowledge of the constitution  - but still registering as a ""Republican"" we will continue to kid ourselves and sing songs of sadness and defeat.  (2) The ""other choice, John Kasich, continues to tell everyone that he is the ""only one"" who can beat Hillary.  This is surprising and yet another fairytale since he has not been able to win in any other state or territory other than Ohio.  But if you trick yourself, you might just believe this fantasy duet.

Here is the ""real truth"", people have been inviting Donald Trump into their homes and their lives for the past 20 years or so.  Those that are ""pro-Trump"" are not going to put aside their ""rock hard', solid commitment towards him and vote for someone they consider appalling at the least.  And you can't make them.  And for those ""strict constitutionalists"" who are OK with putting aside their voting rights and sanctioning the ""delegate games"" as long as ""their guy"" is doing it, you are short sighted.  The next time it won't be ""your guy"" and you will sit around or protest loudly with your nose bent out of shape because ""it ain't fair"" and calling for your ""voter rights"", but they won't be there because you threw it away this time.

That leaves one candidate, Trump.  after tonight and the upcoming win of New Jersey on June 7, 2016, Trump will win ALL of the original 13 colonies.  As much as the hype has been, for whatever reason, around Wisconsin and now Indiana as though they are the linchpins of our United States of America, Trump is the man who has won the majority of the votes in the United States of America.  And for those of you who say ""he can't win against Hillary"", the real story is that you don't WANT him to win.  You see, the same people that are telling you all of that tripe brought you our last two Republican Presidents ....... who were the only ones who could not lose ----- President McCain and President Romney.

You remember THEIR  administrations .... don't you?  I did not think you would because they never happened.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1020336441380480/?type=3,2016-04-26 13:53:46,48,29,54,38,9,0,0,0,1

428053320608798_1019801594767298,"Who was Rachel Carson and Why do we care?  The answer surpisingly has a lot to do with the Zika virus.

""Silent Spring"", written in 1962 by Rachel Carson (1907–1964), brought to the public's attention the results of indiscriminate use of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and other pesticides. Carson also criticized industrial society for abusing the natural environment and failing to recognize the threat to industry's own existence when natural processes are seriously disturbed. Far more than earlier calls to use modern technology responsibly, Silent Spring launched a revolution in attitudes at all levels of society, from schoolchildren to government and industrial leaders. Carson's power did not stem from a charismatic personality, but lay in her scientific knowledge and poetic writing.

DDT was popularly viewed as a miracle of modern technology—especially because it had been successfully used in World War II to kill fleas, mosquitoes, and other insects that can spread deadly diseases like malaria—biologists had begun to compile evidence of the rise of DDT-resistant strains of insect pests and of the harmful side effects of DDT on other species. Nonetheless, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the manufacturers of DDT and similar pesticides continued to support the use of these substances. But Carson's gripping accounts of ecological disasters were based on a meticulous search and use of scientific literature, and her conclusions were upheld by President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee, among other authorities. Carson, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1957, lived only two years after Silent Spring was published and witnessed just the beginning of the groundswell of support for her views.

Once in someone's body, it can take decades to eliminate it.  DDT also crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk, so developing fetuses and children will be exposed if their mothers are exposed.

A relatively new mosquito-borne virus known as Zika has rapidly spread to more than two dozen countries. 

Transmitted by the aggressive Aedes aegypti mosquito, the virus has been linked to a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. The disorder, microcephaly, causes severe developmental issues and sometimes death. 

World Health Organization Director-General Margaret Chan has described the virus's spread as ""a public health emergency of international concern,"" with the potential to infect an estimated 3 million to 4 million people across the Americas in the next year. 

With no treatment or vaccine available, the controversial pesticide DDT -- illegal in the United States for more than 40 years -- has been mentioned in some circles as a way to combat the Zika virus.

DDT was widely used 50 years ago and virtually eliminated this mosquito from the Americas, but DDT was also widely used in agriculture, got into the environment and had serious problems in the environment for many species.

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was the first of the modern synthetic insecticides created in the 1940s, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

The insecticide was effective in battling malaria, typhus and the other insect-borne diseases in military and civilian settings. 

It became a common weapon in the control of insects in crop and livestock production. DDT also was sprayed in institutions, homes and gardens.

DDT was once the most widely used pesticide ""in practically every part of the world,"" according to the EPA. 

A 1940s marketing film shows a housewife drenching her home with the potent bug killer, using a simple spray pump.

""It almost seemed like a parody,"" Michael Schulder, a former senior executive producer for CNN, wrote in 2010. 

In the 30 years before the ban, more than 1.3 million tons of what became known as the ""miracle"" pesticide were used domestically, the EPA said.

DDT is classified as a probable human carcinogen by U.S. and international authorities.  The insecticide has been linked to a number of health issues, including affects on the brain development of children and breast cancer.

Human health effects from DDT at low environmental doses are unknown, according to the CDC. After exposure to high doses, human symptoms can include vomiting, tremors or shakiness and seizures.

This summer my youngest daughter was supposed to visit Brazil.  Unfortunately, that will not happen due to both sides of the equation - the Zika virus and then treatment with this powerful insecticide.  I hope that things will go well with the Olympics, as this might be the least of Brazil's worries.

428053320608798_1019725071441617,"Alfred Cheney Johnston was born on April 8, 1885 in New York to a wealthy family who had connections with New York's upper class.  In 1903, Johnston attended The Art Students League of New York but transferred to the National Academy of Design in New York in 1904 where he studied illustration and experimented with photography. While there, he met fellow student Norman Rockwell with whom he became lifelong friends.

In 1908, Johnston graduated from the Academy and married classmate and painter Doris Gernon in 1909. With the encouragement of family friend Charles Dana Gibson (creator of the ""Gibson Girl""), Johnston continued to develop his photographic skills. His wife Doris was known to complete the darkroom retouch work on his prints and glass plates.

Johnston was invited to become official photographer of the Ziegfeld Follies by its founder Florenz Ziegfeld around 1916. Ziegfeld promoted his productions as ""Glorifying the American Girl"" and it was Johnston's job to capture that vision in photographs. His photos were considered sexual at the time and his props included tapestry backgrounds, pearls, and shawls and scarves  for draping.

Through his relationship with Ziegfeld, Johnston also became known for his portraits of silent film stars, the upper class society, advertising work, layouts for industrial firms and cigarette companies.

Johnston's photographs became famous around the world and he had a very successful career with the Follies until the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent death of Ziegfeld in 1932.

In 1937, Johnston, with Swann Publications,  published his book of artistic nude photographs entitled ""Enchanting Beauty"" which had only limited success. Johnston continued to work in New York until 1939 when he and his wife moved to a rural property in Oxford, Connecticut where they converted their barn into a studio space. There are few records of Johnston's photographic work in Connecticut though he is known to have belonged to photographic clubs and associations where he gave numerous lectures.  Johnston also taught photography from his studio during this time.

In the 1960's, Johnston attempted to donate his studio and photographic works to several organizations in New York and Washington but received little interest in the proposal.  Johnston died in 1971 at Griffin Hospital in Ansonia, Connecticut. In 2006, the book ""Jazz Age Beauties: The Lost Collection of Ziegfeld Photographer Alfred Cheney Johnston"" by Robert Hudovernik was published. Today, Johnston is considered a top photographer of his time, among the ranks of Edward Steichen, Horst, Arnold Genthe, and others.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1019725071441617/?type=3,2016-04-25 12:06:34,12,1,1,10,2,0,0,0,0

Does anyone think Cruz will not wheel and deal for the delegates Kasich wins in this dynamic duo deal?  Kasich is making a deal with the devil.

Parable of the snake:

An old woman was walking down a road one day when she happened upon a group of men beating a poisonous snake with clubs. The woman intervened, saving the snake. She took the snake home and nursed it back to health. When the snake recovered, the woman carried the snake with her wherever she went, caressing it as if it were her child. One day, the snake bit her on the neck. As she lay dying, she asked the snake, ""Why have you done this, after I have been so kind to you?""

""You knew I was a snake when you picked me up, I was not a Biblical man nor a just man...... You knew I was a snake and I do what snakes do....sssssssss"" said the snake.

Proceed with caution when you run upon a snake.......sss.....

428053320608798_1014326518648139,"Can Bono Please Go Back To Singing?

U2 frontman Bono brought his star power to Capitol Hill Tuesday as he called on members of Congress to take swift action to deal with the global refugee crisis and violent extremism.

So, we (in America) are flummoxed over ""what to do about ISIS"" and even more confused about what to call ""IT. We muddle with ""workplace violence"", ""religious extremism"", ""religious terrorism"" and anything except uttering the words ""Islamic"", ""Muslim"" or anything that might point to either of the aforementioned words.  

So what do we do?  Well...... in these un-serious times,  we call on an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, by he name of Bono.  Who else would we call on for foreign affairs?

What were his qualifications?  In 2002, he was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Britons in a poll conducted among the general public, despite the fact he is Irish. In 2004, Bono was given an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Pennsylvania.  No real formal education listed, no experience, just great humanitarian work and a pretty good musical background.

Ok, so he suggested to the Senate last week his idea to combat ISIS - send Amy Schumer, Chris Rock to fight ISIS with comedy.  Ooooops, does he not like them?  So many questions!  Such as:   Did anyone ask these two comedians if they wanted to perform in front of a blood-thirsty group of Islamic extremists?  And what happens when a joke falls flat?  

 We should think this through before we literally ""loose our heads"" --- or in this case Schumer and and Rock's..... heads, that is.

One thing is uncertain, he might have mentioned this before because one comedian in Germany is now in ""hot water"" :

""German Chancellor Angela Merkel has authorized a criminal investigation into whether comedian Jan Böhmermann broke the law when he read a satirical poem about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on German television.

Erdogan has complained that the poem was a smear -- and one that violated an obscure German law against insulting representatives of foreign countries.

Whether the comedian will be charged will be decided by a prosecutor. But under this law, no prosecution could have even been considered without the approval of the government.""

Ok......  Comedy might not be the answer.

Once again, wearing his trademark rose-tinted glasses, that obviously gives him a ""rosy view"" of world problems, Bono said members of Congress need to confront an ""existential threat"" to Europe that hasn't been seen since the 1940s.  So what does he suggest NOW?   He urged lawmakers to think of foreign aid as national security instead of charity.

In other words, the blokes just want a little money and THEN they won't be so ""extreme.""  

Can anyone tell Bono that money is not the answer against ANY form of religious extremism?  Especially since a great number of the leaders (and followers) were brought up in wealth or at least upper middle class families AND many of the kids leaving their families to join ISIS or whatever leave fairly comfortable surroundings to do so.....

I am now humming a tune that accurately describes how I feel about Bono:

428053320608798_1014242415323216,"Who was WeeGee?

Weegee was the pseudonym of Arthur (Usher) Fellig (June 12, 1899 – December 26, 1968), a photographer and photojournalist, known for his stark black and white street photography. Weegee worked in Manhattan, New York City's Lower East Side as a press photographer during the 1930s and '40s, and he developed his signature style by following the city's emergency services and documenting their activity.[1] Much of his work depicted unflinchingly realistic scenes of urban life, crime, injury and death. Weegee published photographic books and also worked in cinema, initially making his own short films and later collaborating with film directors such as Jack Donohue and Stanley Kubrick.

Weegee was born in Złoczów (now Zolochiv, Ukraine), near Lemberg, Austrian Galicia. His name was changed to Arthur when he emigrated with his family to live in New York in 1909. There he took numerous odd jobs, including working as an itinerant photographer and as an assistant to a commercial photographer. In 1924 he was hired as a dark-room technician by Acme Newspictures (later United Press International Photos). He left, however, in 1935 to become a freelance photographer. Describing his beginnings, Weegee stated:

In my particular case I didn't wait 'til somebody gave me a job or something, I went and created a job for myself—freelance photographer. And what I did, anybody else can do. What I did simply was this: I went down to Manhattan Police Headquarters and for two years I worked without a police card or any kind of credentials. When a story came over a police teletype, I would go to it. The idea was I sold the pictures to the newspapers. And naturally, I picked a story that meant something.[2]

He worked at night and competed with the police to be first at the scene of a crime, selling his photographs to tabloids and photographic agencies.[3] His photographs, centered around Manhattan police headquarters, were soon published by the Herald Tribune, World-Telegram, Daily News, New York Post, New York Journal American, Sun, and others.

In 1957, after developing diabetes, he moved in with Wilma Wilcox, a Quaker social worker whom he had known since the 1940s, and who cared for him and then cared for his work.[4] He traveled extensively in Europe until 1968, working for the Daily Mirror and on a variety of photography, film, lecture, and book projects. On December 26, 1968, Weegee died in New York at the age of 69.

In 1938, Fellig was the only New York newspaper reporter with a permit to have a portable police-band shortwave radio. He maintained a complete darkroom in the trunk of his car, to expedite getting his free-lance product to the newspapers. Weegee worked mostly at nightclubs; he listened closely to broadcasts and often beat authorities to the scene.

In 1943 five of his photographs were acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. These works were included in their exhibition entitled, Action Photography.[10] He was later included in ""50 Photographs by 50 Photographers"", another MoMA show organized by photographer Edward Steichen,[10] and he lectured at the New School for Social Research. Advertising and editorial assignments for magazines followed, including Life and beginning in 1945, Vogue.

428053320608798_1014232341990890,"Franz Xaver Winterhalter (20 April 1805 – 8 July 1873) was a German painter and lithographer, known for his portraits of royalty in the mid-nineteenth century. His name has become associated with fashionable court portraiture. Among his best known works are Empress Eugénie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting (1855) and the portraits he made of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1865).

In Paris, Winterhalter quickly became fashionable. He was appointed court painter of Louis-Philippe, the king of the French, who commissioned him to paint individual portraits of his large family. Winterhalter would execute more than thirty commissions for him.

This success earned the painter the reputation of a specialist in dynastic and aristocratic portraiture, skilled in combining likeness with flattery and enlivening official pomp with modern fashion.

However, Winterhalter's reputation in artistic circles suffered. The critics, who had praised his debut in the salon of 1836, dismissed him as a painter that could not be taken seriously. This attitude persisted throughout Winterhalter's career, condemning his work to a category of his own in the hierarchy of painting. Winterhalter himself regarded his first royal commissions as a temporary intermission before returning to subject painting and the field of academic respectability, but he was a victim of his own success and for the rest of his life he would work almost exclusively as a portrait painter. This was a field in which he was not only very successful but also made him rich. Winterhalter became an international celebrity enjoying Royal patronage.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1014232341990890/?type=3,2016-04-16 07:44:20,11,0,0,10,1,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_1013733685374089,"Who was Vivian Maier?  (February 1, 1926 – April 21, 2009) was an American street photographer. Maier worked for about forty years as a nanny, mostly in Chicago's North Shore, pursuing photography during her spare time. She took more than 150,000 photographs during her lifetime, primarily of the people and architecture of New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, although she also traveled and photographed worldwide.

During her lifetime, Maier's photographs were unknown and unpublished, and she never printed many of her negatives. A Chicago collector, John Maloof, acquired some of Maier's photos in 2007, while two other Chicago-based collectors, Ron Slattery and Randy Prow, also found some of Maier's prints and negatives in her boxes and suitcases around the same time. Maier's photographs were first published on the Internet in July 2008, by Slattery, but the work received little response In October 2009, Maloof linked his blog to a selection of Maier's photographs on the image-sharing website Flickr, and the results went ""viral"", with thousands of people expressing interest. Critical acclaim and interest in Maier's work quickly followed, and since then, Maier's photographs have been exhibited in North America, Europe, Asia and South America  while her life and work have been the subject of books and documentary films.

In the documentary film Finding Vivian Maier (2013), the grown-up children whom Maier had cared for in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s recall how she combined her work as a photographer with her day job as a nanny. She would frequently take the young children in her care with her into the center of Chicago when she took her photographs.

His signature style, also known as ""Boterismo"", depicts people and figures in large, exaggerated volume, which can represent political criticism or humor, depending on the piece. He is considered the most recognized and quoted living artist from Latin America,[2][3][4] and his art can be found in highly visible places around the world, such as Park Avenue in New York City and the Champs-Élysées in Paris.

Self-titled ""the most Colombian of Colombian artists"" early on, he came to national prominence when he won the first prize at the Salón de Artistas Colombianos in 1958. Working most of the year in Paris, in the last three decades he has achieved international recognition for his paintings, drawings and sculpture, with exhibitions across the world.His art is collected by many major international museums, corporations, and private collectors. In 2012, he received the International Sculpture Center's Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1011922478888543/?type=3,2016-04-12 08:09:17,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_1011424778938313,"Another great milestone:  Today in 1968,  President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 1968 Civil Rights Act.  

The Civil Rights Act signed into law in April 1968– was also known as the Fair Housing Act–prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin and sex.

This is a landmark part of legislation in the United States that provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or national origin and made it a federal crime to ""by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone … by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin."" The Act was signed into law during the King assassination riots by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had previously signed the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act into law.

Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 is commonly known as the Fair Housing Act and was meant as a follow‑up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibited discrimination in housing, there were no federal enforcement provisions. The 1968 act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, and since 1974, gender; since 1988, the act protects people with disabilities and families with children.

Victims of discrimination may use both the 1968 act and the 1866 act via section 1983[3] to seek redress. The 1968 act provides for federal solutions while the 1866 act provides for private solutions (i.e., civil suits).

Titles II through VII comprised the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, which applies to the Native American tribes of the United States and makes many, but not all, of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights applicable within the tribes (that Act appears today in Title 25, sections 1301 to 1303 of the United States Code).

A rider attached to the bill makes it a felony to ""travel in interstate commerce...with the intent to incite, promote, encourage, participate in and carry on a riot"". This provision has been criticized for ""equating organized political protest with organized violence"".

The Civil Rights Act of 1968 also enacted 18 U.S.C. § 245(b)(2), which permits federal prosecution of anyone who ""willingly injures, intimidates or interferes with another person, or attempts to do so, by force because of the other person's race, color, religion or national origin""  because of the victim's attempt to engage in one of six types of federally protected activities, such as attending school, patronizing a public place/facility, applying for employment, acting as a juror in a state court or voting.

Persons violating this law face a fine or imprisonment of up to one year, or both. If bodily injury results or if such acts of intimidation involve the use of firearms, explosives or fire, individuals can receive prison terms of up to 10 years, while crimes involving kidnapping, sexual assault, or murder can be punishable by life in prison or the death penalty.

Though sexual orientation and gender identity are also excluded from this law, they are included in a more recent Federal hate-crime law, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

Allies liberated Buchenwald concentration camp.  I am not sure that you remember in 2008 that Barack Obama told the press his uncle was one of the liberators.  Charles Payne, 84, (the said)  was among the American infantrymen who liberated Ohrdruf, a subdivision of the Buchenwald camp, in April 1945

.Asked if his great nephew was following in his footsteps, which the White House has suggested as a reason for the trip, Mr Payne told the German magazine Der Spiegel: ""I don't buy that. This is a trip that he chose, not because of me I'm sure, but for political reasons.""

Denting the normally smooth-running presidential public relations machine, he added: ""Perhaps his visit also has something to do with improving his standing with Angela Merkel. She gave him a hard time during his campaign and also afterwards.""

Exposing the haste with which political biographies can be formed, Mr Payne expressed surprise at how his great-nephew had used his wartime experiences on the campaign trail. As a candidate, Mr Obama used the wartime service of his white mother's parents and family to allay concerns about his heritage.
""I was quite surprised when the whole thing came up and Barack talked about my war experiences in Nazi Germany. We had never talked about that before,"" he said, adding that he enjoyed a ""warm and friendly relationship"" with his great nephew, though he was not part of his inner circle.

The first time they discussed his participation in the war was when Mr Obama wrongly said during the campaign that Mr Payne had ""liberated"" Auschwitz. Opponents swiftly pointed out that had been done by the Red Army.

""He couldn't have gotten it from me since we had never talked about this particular episode in the war,"" he said. ""My sister and her husband were both great storytellers and sometimes made up the details to go along with it. They told him about my deployment with the 89th Infantry Division and apparently they mixed up a few details.""

A lot of times when we think of Concentration Camps we imagine the death camps the Germans built in Poland where the primary business was killing large numbers of civilians.  Buchenwald wasn't a death camp.  Millions did not die there, burned in the ovens, their ashes scattered in ponds where the water is still gray 70 years later.  But they did die there.  About one out four people died each year. What did they die of in Buchenwald?

Mainly starvation. 

I find it amusing that when you are a Democrat or favored establishment republican a lie is called ""great storytelling"" but anyone outside that circle is a ""liar"".

Nevertheless, this tidbit was part of the story.  On April 11, 1945, in expectation of liberation, starved and emaciated prisoners stormed the watchtowers, seizing control of the camp. Later that afternoon, US forces entered Buchenwald. Soldiers from the 6th Armored Division, part of the Third Army, found more than 21,000 prisoners in the camp.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1011421422271982/?type=3,2016-04-11 13:11:57,12,2,2,9,0,1,0,2,0
428053320608798_1011414715605986,"John William Waterhouse (April 6, 1849 – February 10, 1917) was an English painter known for working in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked several decades after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which had seen its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to his sobriquet ""the modern Pre-Raphaelite"". Borrowing stylistic influences not only from the earlier Pre-Raphaelites but also from his contemporaries, the Impressionists,[1] his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend.

Born in Italy to English parents who were both painters, he later moved to London, where he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Art. He soon began exhibiting at their annual summer exhibitions, focusing on the creation of large canvas works depicting scenes from the daily life and mythology of ancient Greece. Later on in his career he came to embrace the Pre-Raphaelite style of painting despite the fact that it had gone out of fashion in the British art scene several decades before.

Although not as well known as earlier Pre-Raphaelite artists such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt, Waterhouse's work is currently displayed at several major British art galleries, and the Royal Academy of Art organised a major retrospective of his work in 2009.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1011414715605986/?type=3,2016-04-11 12:54:13,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The ""Establishment"" is playing this one to lose.  They figure this time if you  --- (the people) - lose, then they (the establishment) will win.  The party establishment is talking about pulling out all the stops to prevent Trump from capturing the nomination, including ""using"" Ted Cruz, who they KNOW will lose the general election.He is un-electable and they know it....

Jerome Corsi, a WND senior staff writer and longtime political observer, claims the GOP establishment does not always play to win.

""The establishment of the GOP is happy to have a Democratic Party president because they can do the social agenda they want without being responsible for it,"" Corsi said in an interview.

The truth is, if they manage to derail Trump, all of the stories and so forth that have not made it to the papers, internet and main stream shows will mysteriously show up.  He will be ""creamed"" day after day with revelations from ""the other side"".  Not to mention all of the preaching ...... to the secular crowd that will make the ""Dean Scream"" look elementary.  

I thought that the two men, Trump and Cruz would see the light on this fact, however, they did not and now are playing into the ""divide and conquer"" game.  

Tsk...Tsk....  Am I the only one that spends my life with the ""regular people"" who look at this whole bru-ha-ha on this side as appalling?  They have played these two men like fiddles.  Kasich is only there to mark a space.  He has only one one state (Rubio  still has more delegates and he dropped out long ago) --- his own but will serve to peel off enough delegates as to destroy the chances of anyone else reaching 1237.  And he is there to be the contrarian ---- no wall - he wants amnesty; you want an abortion - abortion is good with me - Kasich.  So forth and so on......  he is the place holder for the ""fresh face""  that Karl Rove, President Romney and President McCain are hankering for.  

Just one problem they have not thought about, I think, and that will be the loss of voters on the Republican side.  I know that the vainglorious thought of vain men and women make them think that the crowd is there for them ...... but the crowd came for one man and lose that man - lights out and everyone goes home.  I imagine for some of them it feels like High School when all that can be said in a full room until the popular guy arrives is that ""no-one's here yet"".  or when the popular guy leaves,  ""everybody's gone now"" as the ordinaries are left to their hum drum.

428053320608798_1005409136206544,"Could this end up being an issue after all?

Ted was born a dual/multiple Citizen of more than one country. Ted was not a ""natural born Citizen"" when he was born, i.e., with sole allegiance to only one country! And that is what the founders and framers of our Constitution intended and understood. Future President had to have sole allegiance and unity of citizenship in one and only one country at birth – the United States. 

The founders and framers did NOT wish that any future President would have ""foreign influence"" or allegiance claims on them by or at birth. For national security reasons, they wanted the future Commanders in Chief to have sole allegiance to only the USA. Obama, a self proclaimed Citizen of the World and with an unknown unproven birth narrative to 100% certainty and using various forged key ID documents, is a classic example of why they put that requirement in there. Obama does not meet the test. The political parties decided to ignore that part of the eligibility test in 2008. Now they are at it again. Ted does not meet that test either and never can. An important national security clause in Article II of our Constitution is being ignored by the major political parties and the enabling major media for several candidates now – Cruz, Rubio, and Jindal. I assume it is because the both major political parties want to ratify forever more the precedence of what they did in the 2008 election cycle with Obama.

Kurbanov was immediately accepted into the Repin Institute in St. Petersburg, where he studied with the late Neprintsov, graduating in 1994.

Kurbanov strives to combine the techniques of the old masters - Pieter de Hooch and Vermeer are two of his favorites - with a contemporary, personal sense of imagery. Biblical and historical references appear alongside modern elements in his paintings, often producing an atmosphere of mystery. Portraiture commands a prominent position in his work. His portraits are intended to be compositions in their own right, in addition to presenting precise, almost photographic likenesses of the sitters. ince 2008, in addition to creating his own work, Arsen has been teaching in the easel painting department at the I.E.

428053320608798_1003605373053587,"""Do it Yourself Abortions"" or ""How to have the Most Horrifying Experience of Your Life""

The new FDA-approved regime on the abortion pill was welcomed Wednesday by abortion rights groups who say the drug expands options for women but was criticized by opponents who assert serious risks remain.

The FDA changes mean that drug Mifeprex, the brand name for mifepristone, can be used 70 days into pregnancy instead of the prior FDA guideline of only up to 49 days into pregnancy.

So, what happens?  You know when you chemically induce this abortion in your own home?

Mifepristone, causes the embryo to detach from the uterine wall. Most women don't feel a thing. Two days later, a pill called misoprostol contracts the uterus to expel the embryo. You can expect heavy bleeding,extreme cramping, with clotting and bits of tissue, to last about two weeks. Crazy fact: The pills are only 95 percent effective. If you're in the unlucky 5 percent, you can do it again or opt to have a procedure.

Crayzee..... then you can complete this all over again!

But remember!  Misoprostol causes contractions of the womb. As a consequence, the womb expels the pregnancy. A woman can get painful cramps, vaginal blood loss that is more than a normal menstruation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. There is a risk of heavy bleeding for which a woman will have to be treated by a doctor.  

In addition, there may be only partial expulsion of the ""tissue"".  Some serious illnesses, such as, for instance, severe anaemia, can create problems because of the heavy blood loss involved.   

Here is one woman's journey:

Arriving at her appointment, Planned Parenthood made her husband stay in the waiting room while they brought her back for what Kay described as ""an invasive trans-vaginal ultrasound that took nearly 45 minutes."" Yes, that would be the same ""invasive"" trans-vaginal ultrasound that allies of Planned Parenthood have likened to rape in other contexts. As we have noted on many occasions (and verified by Kay's account), the use of such ultrasounds appears to be standard procedure at Planned Parenthood.

She was then directed to watch a video on the abortion pill which, according to Kay, ""described the process very superficially"" and compared it a ""heavy period.""

Kay had questions she wanted to ask the abortionist, but he had little time for her.

""In less than two minutes the physician covered the four medicines he was giving me [the abortifacient mifepristone, the prostaglandin misoprostol to induce contractions, plus drugs for pain and nausea]…, the procedure, and what I ought to expect.""

When he finished and she began to ask questions, ""he handed me a one-page printout with drawn diagrams and said, 'This will cover everything you need to know'."" When Kay pressed him, the doctor told her

""Don't be so anal about this. The hardest part, getting here, is over. Just follow the directions on the printout. All the information you need is there.""

When Kay pointed out that one instruction he had given her personally — not to take anything with aspirin, which is a blood thinner — was not on the page he handed her, the abortionist told her, ""If you have any problems call the number on the handout and don't put anything in you vagina – fingers, crayons, etc. – for three weeks.""

Kay notes ""That was the end of our 'consultation.'"" It lasted ten minutes.

She took the RU-486 there in the office and took the other pills home in a brown paper bag.

She took the prostaglandin misoprostol two days later, ""follow[ing] the directions exactly,"" and sat in a warm bath, waiting for the drugs to take effect.

Within 15 minutes of the pills dissolving, she felt heavy pressure in her lower abdomen and ""uncontrollable cramping."" She felt so much pain she says she nearly fainted.

She was in such pain, she called her husband and says she ""told him I was dying."" In her words, the pain was ""unimaginable,"" ""Indescribable,"" ""the worst pain I have ever felt."" Kay says ""With every cramp I felt my heart race and my blood pressure plummet."" She says she felt ""nauseated, dizzy and lightheaded.""

By the time her husband got home, ""the water in the tub was colored red by blood and our dog was barking like mad in-between my screams.""

When her husband called the emergency number given them by the clinic and described the situation, the people on the other end of the phone labeled this ""normal"" and said she did not need to go to the hospital.

They suggested she take some more pain pills if she was ""uncomfortable,""

Kay said. It was also then that they told her husband that she should not be in the tub because an infection could enter the uterus [such infections killed Holly Patterson and at least seven other chemical abortion patients]. This instruction, Kay noted, was yet one more not on the information sheet she'd received.

Her husband got her out of the tub, and into the bed. She took more pain pills, totaling four hydrocodones in less than an hour and a half, but these ""barely cut the pain."" Kay says, ""I faded in and out, shivering and sweating.""

It was then, with her husband lying next to her, that Kay says, ""I went through the worst experience of my life.""

""After two hours of this,"" Kay says, ""I felt a rush of blood and a large lemon-sized clot came out. I assume that was the pregnancy. I was horrified. Why hadn't anyone told me that it would be like this?""

Her husband cleaned the blood off her, cleaned up the towels, changed the sheets, dressed her because she was too weak from the pain. She took two more pain pills and finally slept.

A follow-up trans-vaginal ultrasound at three weeks confirmed that the abortion had occurred and that there were no signs of infection.

But the process was far from over.

Kay says ""I still bled for the next five weeks. Sometimes it would just be spotting, but at other times there would be gushes of blood.""

She mentions one particular afternoon, a month or so later, when she was getting out of the car and felt a gush. She thought she had simply had a sudden loss of bladder control, but when she stood up, she found the seat of the car ""was covered in blood.""

""There was blood everywhere – on the seat, on the floor of the car, on the back of my skirt, down my legs (and completely soaked through the mega-pad that Planned Parenthood had recommended.""

When her husband called the emergency number again, he was again informed that this was ""normal."" And once again, he was told that she didn't need to go to the hospital – unless this was happening continuously.

There were other occasions when she bled through her pad and her pants during meetings. ""Embarrassed,"" Kay says, ""I spent most of my time depressed and hiding at home.""

One should keep in mind that, to Planned Parenthood, Kay's experience was ""normal."" As far as they are concerned, she experienced no reportable complication and is likely to be counted as one more successful chemical abortion.""

Kay, though, saw her ordeal as ""awful,"" as ""traumatic."" She was not happy with Planned Parenthood or the way they treated her.

""I was angry that I hadn't been sufficiently told or warned about the potential dangers and side effects of the medical [chemical] abortion.""

She told this to a friend who suggested that ""Planned Parenthood probably didn't want to 'scare me away from having an abortion.'""

Kay, unrepentant about her abortion and still ""pro-choice"" to the core, still says efforts to ""help women make the difficult choice to end their pregnancy"" should not ""come at the expense of fully informing them."" If she had been given all the information, Kay says she would have opted for the surgical procedure.

Kay says, ""I cannot imagine what it would have been like to be a teenager or even a young woman going through that experience."" She had her husband with her, but says ""What I keep thinking about is, 'What if I had been alone?'""

The trouble is, of course, that many women, including many teenagers, do go through these traumatic abortions all alone. Some, in places where Planned Parenthood does webcam abortions, never even spend time in the same room as a doctor, much less even ten minutes.

As I said.....The new FDA-approved regime on the abortion pill was welcomed Wednesday by abortion rights groups who say the drug expands options for women.

428053320608798_1003212013092923,"So...... Angela, what are the 5 top functions of Government?

The chief author of the American Constitution, and justly called its ""Father,"" was a Christian statesman, James Madison. (He would also become the fourth U.S. president.) That the Constitution was the product of Christianity, and of its ideas of man and government, is revealed by the biblical functions of government that Madison listed in its preamble:

1. To establish justice – This is the goal of the passages in Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2:14, which say that government is to punish evildoers and protect those who do right.

2. To insure domestic tranquility – This phrase comes from the focus of prayer for government, which Paul urged in 1 Timothy 2:1-2. The New American Standard Bible says to pray for government ""in order that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.""

3. To provide for the common defense – The protection of innocent human life is at the base of not only capital punishment (Genesis 9:6), but also in the provision of an army for protection from external threats.

4. To promote the general welfare – Romans 13:4 says that civil rulers are servants ""to you for good."" The common good of all classes of citizens must be promoted by government passage of laws guaranteeing equal opportunity. It is not proper for government to provide money and aid to special interest groups. It is to promote, not provide, and to do so for all people in general, not for special people.

5. To secure the blessings of liberty – Blessing are a gift of one's Creator, not a privilege granted by government. These blessings include life, liberty, and property. A biblical view of government sees that it cannot provide these, only secure them.

Last night, Trump, at the townhall was asked this question and he replied:  Donald Trumps Top 3 functions of the government:
 1.) Security
 2.) HEALTHCARE
 3.) EDUCATION

One of the people on my facebook wall proceeded to refer to him as a ""clown"" and ""Wait.... whaaaa??????? Friggin HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION and HOUSING is now the responsibility of THE GOVERNMENT?!?!?! And people still think this clown is a Republican?!?!?!? #Assclown

428053320608798_1003093836438074,"Why I am a Trump Supporter:  The many reasons.

One of the most craven and disgusting things that I have noticed in American politics is the brazen ""me-first"" orientation of the media.  Every story is framed in the context of what it means .... to them.  In this particular election, the over-the-top need to take everything that happens, parse it and use it as a dagger against the opposition is not only off the wall , it is dangerous.  Lets look at a couple of situations:

Michelle Fields-gate:  I don't know Michelle Fields personally, however, the times that I have heard about her all involved someone --- men in particular throwing her to the ground, groping her or somehow victimizing her and therefore allowing her to take center stage in one story or another.  Last night each of the other two candidates vowed to ""fire"" their campaign manager should it be them that inadvertently touched a ""damsel in distress reporter""..  Look, he reality of the situation is this, she was not beaten, shoved to the ground or anything at all.  You get more contact with people getting on to the bus in Palm Beach or the subway in New York.  SHE OVERSTEPPED her bounds and approached the Presidential candidate, she was not brought to the ground, nor was she ""roughed up"". Very dramatically she declared that this was the worse thing that EVER happened to her since the DEATH OF HER FATHER.  

Oh my, this is a simple situation, made melodramatic by someone hoping for a ticket to ...... something but not a ticket to the line of truth.  This was an ""opportunity"", and even more so than the time she claimed to be thrown to the ground by the NYPD, she is now in the big leagues.  Cokie Roberts (blast from past of my my teenager days), on Morning Joe acted as though this was akin to the beating of Dan Rather during the 1960's.  

Here is the problem.  In a crowded room, where you have a Presidential candidate who has received credible death threats and is trying to make his way from one end to another, you don't grab that Presidential candidate and attempt to interview him.  In the first place, did she think he was going to stop and grant her the interview right then and there?  With the Secret Service, security and others around him do you seriously believe this would happen?  No, there should be no reasonable expectation of anything except being pulled, moved or asked to step aside... maybe even rudely asked with ""ugly"" words..  

Next, the exchange between Lewendowski and Fields, was not significant.  And one might add that how was he supposed to know WHO SHE WAS?    She is NOT famous, although after this debacle she is ""well known"".  Here is the problem in a nutshell, if every woman who gets brushed, pulled or asked to step aside is able to get on television shaking, crying and fainting about the possibility of losing her step, stumbling or being spoken to harshly, then we ARE the weaker sex and perhaps there should be a partition with a couch and some smelling salts set aside for female reporters so that they are not touched, jostled or whatever by ""big bad men-folk bully boys.""  Then this ominous ""something happened"" BS that people in the news keep talking about and no one can see will be a phantom that no longer exists since the women-folk will be protected.  

And by the way, if all she wanted was an ""apology"" and then it would not have been ""battery"", how can this be so?   Battery is battery regardless of the apology.  For example, if someone robs my house, I don't give a hoot if they apologize.  They can if it makes them feel better but the truth is I am still pressing charges..People, if he apologized, she would still be on show after show, crying, holding her arm and writhing in pain..... maybe even reporting from bed recalling flashbacks of whatever...

And use critical thinking, the ""bruise"" on her arm and the incident that occurred are two different things --- one does not necessarily lead to the other.  . With minor injuries — like bumping your arm or pinching your finger — the bleeding is usually confined to your skin and the bruise becomes apparent within hours.....   Is that really a bruise from Lewandowski so soon after a minor brush?

You have got to ask yourself, why is this reporter always the center of every story?  And why are we talking about this instead of the many really news-worthy things that are going on the world?  Answer?  It is easy and we are lazy.  Stories about  Donald Trump being a woman beater or supporting woman beating, woman burning, or woman bruising or Cruz's alleged woman banging is more intriguing than foreign policy, the economy or people blowing up in the airport after taking a trip.  

Now second.  We should all be so lucky to have not to have a reactionary boss, friend or leader.  Loyalty is often spoken about but seldom employed.  Frequently men have found themselves with the short end of the stick while women who know that their word will be given a greater than 50 percent chance of being ""right"" utilize this fact to their advantage.  For example, I have a brother, very successful, who worked in the financial aid office with me when I was at University.  I am older than my brother and she was older than me.  My brothers are very handsome and this one especially.  This older woman liked  him and asked him out.  His response ""You're kidding..... dang you are older than my sister and she is OLD, so you are kidding.... right?""  (Actually I was not that old but to him... well he is my little brother).  She was offended.  She began to cry.  She complained to the supervisor.  My brother was fired for verbally assaulting a woman.

It is expedient; it is politically correct; it will get you ""atta-boys"" to say emphatically, ""I would fire that MAN"".  The other candidates said ""I will fire,,,,,"" and then smiled in the camera and waited the 5 seconds for the applause.  You see people, the way in which people act in times when it makes little or no difference, the way they stand up to the crap that will be flung in their faces, the manner in which they defend the people who defend THEM on even a small thing depicts something that we have not seen in a very long time - LOYALTY or the lack thereof.

And a person who can be loyal, even when the world, Jupiter police who know that this woman's account is a crock of brown soup, has- been, dishonest  reporters such as Cokie Roberts whose vision is blinded by politics, the Republican establishment hell-bent on destroying their own party, and so on ...... is a brave man.  A brave man who will NOT waiver in support of the USA.  Who will NOT run around apologizing to the world about America and handing out our hard earned tax dollars like the ""Candy Man"".  A man who will not do the wave in Cuba, play golf, dance the tango in Argentina or ""offend the optics"" when his own people are suffering......

A man who will stand up for the little campaign manager, the sick woman who was once in one of his pageants, the former marine who was ignored by the current administration who left him to rot in the Mexican jail, me and you.  

Is he perfect?  Nope.....  perfection will never be reached on this earth but he is good enough for me.

I don't care WHO you vote for, and I really don't care if you hate me for who I like.  We are still in a free country, let's hope it remains that way.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/1003093836438074/?type=3,2016-03-30 07:57:09,181,63,184,145,33,2,0,1,0

Tjalf Sparnaay has previously lived in the province of Drenthe but currently lives and works in Hilversum, The Netherlands.[4] He calls himself as well artist as businessman.

Sparnaay is inspired by the Dutch painter Carel Willink. His examples in photorealism became Ralph Goings, Charles Bell and Richard Estes.
The oil paintings of Sparnaay are based on everyday objects. His subjects are items such as a breakfast, a crushed coca-cola can, a fried egg, a half eaten sandwich, cheeseburgers and desserts, a bag of chips with mayonnaise, a Dutch raw herring with a little flag, and a bunch of tulips still wrapped in cellophane.[8] His paintings refer to the tradition of Dutch 17th century still-life, but are expanded to megaproportions using photorealistic techniques.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/1001042796643178/?type=3,2016-03-28 07:34:35,6,1,1,6,0,0,0,0,0

Not real exciting - day to day, little political fervor, beauty, art, history and the close proximity of a number of ""cool"" places reachable by the Bahn using my discounted student card -  very generous for students all the way to 26.  As the author found out, things have changed.

But then again.... maybe I live in a dream world.  Germany, a country with some of the strictest gun control in the world — it requires not only extensive psychological screening but also a year's wait to get a gun — has been the site of three of the worst five multiple-victim K-12 public school shootings in the world, all in the past decade. There are more examples of attacks in countries with strict gun control, like in Belgium, Austria, Britain, France, Australia and Italy.

I lived in Schweinfurt, Germany.

There was no mention, on the Facebook post that has been shared 2,521 times since last week, of McMath's death certificate: a document signed by a California coroner in 2013, declaring her deceased after a routine tonsil removal surgery produced fatal complications.

In legal terms, McMath is no longer alive, because she is brain-dead. Her neurological processes have ceased, and unlike comatose patients in vegetative states, there is no hope for recovery from brain death.

The brain-dead will never open their eyes, nor speak, nor walk again.

And yet — with modern technology, it is possible for their organs to continue functioning, and for parts of their body (like hair, for instance) to keep growing. On life support, they maintain a heartbeat.

428053320608798_994830887264369,"Joshua Johnson (c.1763 – c.1824) was a biracial American painter from the Baltimore area. Johnson, often viewed as the first person of color to make a living as a painter in the United States, is known for his naïve paintings of prominent Maryland residents.

It was not until 1939 that the identity of the painter of elite 19th-century Baltimoreans was discovered by art historian and genealogist J. Hall Pleasants, who believed that thirteen portraits were painted by one Joshua Johnson. Pleasants attempted to put the puzzle of Johnson's life together; however, questions on Johnson's race, life dates and even his last name (Johnson or Johnston) remained up until the mid-1990s, when the Maryland Historical Society released newly found manuscripts regarding Johnson's life.

Documents dated from July 25, 1782, state that Johnson was the ""son of a white man and a black slave woman owned by a William Wheeler, Sr."" His father, George Johnson (also spelled Johnston in some documents) purchased Joshua, age 19, from William Wheeler, a small Baltimore-based farmer, confirmed by a bill of sale dating from October 6, 1764.

Wheeler sold Johnson the young man for £25, half the average price of a male slave field hand at the time. The documents state little of Joshua's mother, not even her name, and she may have been owned by Wheeler, whose own records stated that he owned two female slaves, one of whom had two children. A manumission was also released, in which George Johnson acknowledged Joshua as his son, also stating that he would agree to free Joshua under the conditions that he either completed an apprenticeship with Baltimore blacksmith William Forepaugh or turned 21, whichever came first.

Johnson received his freedom in 1782 and began advertising, identifying himself as a portrait painter and limner as of 1796. He moved frequently, residing often where other artists, specifically chair-makers, lived, which suggests that he may have provided extra income for himself by painting chairs. His frequent moving also may suggest that he tended to work for clients whom he lived by. No records mention educational or creative training and it still has not been proven that he had any type of relationship with artists such as the Peale family, Ralph Earl, or Ralph Earl Jr.

In 1785 he married his first wife, Sarah, whom he had four children with – two sons and two daughters, the latter of whom both died young. By 1803 he was married to a Clara. According to the Baltimore city directory of 1817-1818 he was listed in the section ""Free Householders of Colour,"" and in 1825 he had moved to Frederick County, Maryland, and two years later moved to Anne Arundel County, again, following the paths of those whose portraits he painted. Little is known of his life after this final move, and his death.

Recent research has brought to light that Johnson was not associated with the Peale family; however, his work is still associated with names such as Charles Peale Polk, whose naive painting and less sophisticated work (compared to his other family members) is similar to Johnson's.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/994830887264369/?type=3,2016-03-22 07:59:37,20,1,1,20,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_994154993998625,"By 1940 Palmer Hayden was known for his narrative scenes of New York's urban life and the rural South. Like a photographer taking snapshots, he depicted black subjects during unguarded moments in their daily routine. His characterizations-sometimes humorous, sometimes unflattering-are nonetheless caring and proud. Described by Hayden's compelling use of line, they possess the immediacy of popular illustrations.

Although the artist's studio is a time-honored theme, Hayden's intention in The Janitor Who Paints[SAAM, 1967.57.28] is more provocative than usual because he described it as a ""protest painting"" in a 1969 interview. An easel, palette, and brushes share space with a bed, nightstand, feather duster, and broom. Is Hayden's subject an amateur, painting portraits of his family and friends in his spare time at home? Or is he a professional artist, forced to support himself in a modest occupation and to combine his creative and domestic spheres in one setting? Having taken odd jobs including housecleaning to support himself, Hayden experienced the economic hardships of many black artists, and the painting has often been interpreted as both a self-portrait and a statement on adversity.

The most immediate source for the element of protest that Hayden associated with the work, however, was his friendship with Cloyd Boykin, an older African-American painter who supported himself as a janitor:""I painted it because no one called Boykin the artist. They called him the janitor."" Hayden incorporated details such as the beret and the subject of mother and child to reinforce the sense of artistic identity, while the clock alludes to the workman's schedule.

Initially self-taught, Hayden sought training in New York and Paris, yet his style has frequently been described as primitive. In The Janitor Who Paints, the figures' oversized hands and intense, cartoonlike expressions, as well as the freely treated space in which shapes are outlined as relatively flat areas of color, recall the simplified forms of American folk art. Actually, these elements owe as much to the broader influences of African and modern art that Hayden encountered in Paris as to his highly personal approach to interpreting the vitality and challenges of African-American life.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/994154993998625/?type=3,2016-03-21 13:24:19,16,2,1,16,0,0,0,0,0

Richard B. Spencer, the 37-year-old president of the white nationalist National Policy Institute in Whitefish, Mont., embodies this new generation.

He holds a master's degree from the University of Chicago and studied for a doctorate in history at Duke University. Now he runs an organization that produces papers on issues like racial differences in intelligence.

Stormfront's website, operated by Mr. Black out of his home in West Palm Beach, Fla., features the slogan ""White Pride World Wide."" It is primarily a chat room, with discussion threads that range from innocuous cooking tips to diatribes against gays, immigrants, Jews and blacks.

Mr. Black said he had broken from the Klan because it had a history of ""random and senseless violence."" But he also said he could not rule out violent conflict as white people tried to promote what he called ""our heritage, our values,"" and attempted to realize the dream of a separate all-white enclave.

My wife said later that it was the first time she recognized the very real danger of Cruz's candidacy. It was built, in subtle ways, on hate, on resentment. And when it gained momentum, those subtleties became unsubtle. And we could feel it. There was cruelty in the air, and it wasn't coming from Cruz.

Whatever your worries may be about the possibility of a Trump presidency, perhaps you can take comfort, as I do, that the confusion of the Trump supporter is less dangerous than the conviction of the voters who support Ted Cruz. Trump supporters are looking for answers, Cruz supporters already know the answers. A fearful person may be made dangerous, but a cruel person is already there.

428053320608798_988856264528498,"Val Byrne was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1936 . He studied Art and Architecture at University College Dubin (UCD) where he graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree.

After a short spell working in London Val Byrne returned to Dublin and established a partnership with another architect. By the early 70's the business had grown into one of the larger practices in Dublin and was carrying out major projects throughout Ireland, Africa and the Middle East. In 1985 Val was awarded and made a Fellow of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (FRIAI).

In the late 1980's Val retired from his Architect practice and returned full time to his love of painting. Val Byrne has painted all of his life winning his first major national art competition in Ireland in his teens. Because of his architectural background Val has a particular interest in the urban landscape of Ireland. Most of Byrne's contemporary paintings record Irish scenes of the 20th and 21st Century with an emphasis on harbours and boats and a mixture of domestic and residential buildings.

Val Byrne contemporary paintings include the bright colours of the painted buildings which are nowadays very characteristic of the towns, villages and harbours around Ireland. Val has always sought to include in his paintings a degree of quirkyness and the absurd. As he says: ""If there is wobbly leaning lamppost with straggling wires in the scene, I leave it in'�, but he also has a developing interest in his first love - Cubism. Today he is probably the only Irish artist working with a Cubist approach to Irish images.

Today Val Byrne paintings are held in private and corporate art collections throughout the world including: Mary McAleese, President of Ireland; Mary Robinson, Former President of Ireland and U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights; Jean Kennedy Smith, former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland and several Irish Embassies in Europe, USA, Africa, Asia. In 2004 Val Byrne completed six large paintings for the Irish Ambassador's new residence in Canberra, Australia. Val's paintings have also often featured in publications most notably Forty paintings were commissioned for the book "" Bray and North Wicklow"" published in 2004 and his paintings of the 75th Anniversary of the Irish Navy are included in "" A Maritime history of Cork""",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/988856264528498/?type=3,2016-03-14 06:39:35,15,2,2,13,2,0,0,0,0

Butler was born and spent most of her life in Kilmurry, Thomastown, County Kilkenny and was associated with the Newlyn School of painters.

Mildred Anne's en plein air style is dominated by the theme of nature and reflects scenes of domesticity around the family home in Kilmurry. She achieved distinction in her lifetime and exhibited in major galleries in Ireland and England. Among her patrons were Queen Mary of Teck and Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse.

She became a member of the Royal Academy in 1893. In 1896, Butler's Morning Bath was exhibited at the Royal Academy.[a] It was the first work by a female artist to be purchased by the trustees of the Chantrey Bequest and was then presented to the Tate.[b] She became an associate member of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1896 and was granted full membership in 1937.

She was one of the first academicians elected by the Ulster Academy of Arts in 1930. She virtually stopped painting by the 1930s due to arthritis and died in 1941, aged 83. Around four hundred pieces of her work were sold as part of the artist's studio sale in 1980.

New video of Donald Trump's press conference Tuesday evening shows that the Washington Post's account of an altercation involving Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields could not possibly have happened as Ben Terris reported.

The injury may have been accidental, owing simply to the chaos of the press scrum. A video filmed by a local CBS reporter earlier in the evening shows Fields standing near Trump and the same security official, with no concern or alarm on the part of Trump campaign staff.

So..... should Lewandowski take the blame for it if she has bruises on her arm and no-one else can be found?

It was a global war like nothing before it. The world's armies and navies engaged in mortal combat in the Atlantic and the Pacific, in Europe and in Asia, on land, on sea, and in the air. But the war was not waged by troops alone. Entire populations were mobilized in active support of the war effort. To maintain public morale and the public commitment for the long haul, nations employed many techniques and utilized all available communication media. The printed poster was one of the most effective ways of motivating the public. Posters could be placed anywhere to provide citizens with constant reminders to give more, produce more, and sacrifice more for the war effort.

Posters were not only a vital communication medium, they also symbolized an important art form during the Second World War. Produced by government agencies and by commercial firms, posters conveyed their messages through a combination of emotional illustrations and memorable phrases of text. They inspired patriotism while urging citizens to make sacrifices for their national cause.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/986973758050082/?type=3,2016-03-11 06:17:54,21,0,5,20,1,0,0,0,0

The following year they settled in Toorak, Melbourne, Victoria and Lina grew up moving between Australia, England and France. She used her knowledge of French to work as a translator. She married Baynham Bryans in 1931 and they had a son, Edward (24-6-1932– 23-3-2010), who made his name as a newsreader on ABC radio and television. The marriage broke down and Lina moved to South Yarra in 1936. She met Jock (William) Frater and decided with his help and encouragement to become a painter. She'd had no involvement with art before.[2] Her interest was probably encouraged in the early years by Iain MacKinnon, the Scottish watercolour artist who introduced her to modern French art, and took her to galleries and exhibitions.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/985982071482584/?type=3,2016-03-09 12:53:06,12,1,0,12,0,0,0,0,0

Men and women and every single person are different . The socialist idiocy of everyone being the same is just social engineering garbage that benefits no one .
It's interesting reading stories about the new Germany and how some of its female citizens are being assaulted by migrants and how German men are stepping up to protect their women. I haven't heard any feminist tell the German men to stop. That they can take care of themselves.

428053320608798_984756004938524,"Joseph Christian Leyendecker was born in Montabaur, Germany, and immigrated with his family to Chicago, Illinois, at the age of 8. Showing an early interest in painting, he got his first job at the age of 16 in a Chicago engraving house on the strength of some large pictures he had painted on kitchen oilcloth. In the evenings after work, he studied drawing and anatomy under John H. Vanderpoel at the Chicago Art Institute. Years later, he and his brother Frank Xavier enrolled in the Academie Julian in Paris.

Upon their return, the brothers moved to New York, then the center of American commercial art, advertising, and publishing. As a thoroughly trained artist with immense technical facility, Leyendecker had no difficulty in obtaining top commissions for advertising illustrations and cover designs for leading publications.

He found a niche in fashion and merchandise advertising in the 1920s, producing commissioned pieces for companies Interwoven Socks, Kellogg, Hartmarx, B. Kuppenheimer & Co., and Cluett Peabody & Company, who famously hired him to develop a series of images of the Arrow brand of shirt collars. Leyendecker's images came to define the fashionable American man of the early 20th century.

At the apex of his career, Leyendecker was considered one of the pre-eminent commercial American artists. It is said that his technical skill was beyond reproach, he worked amazingly fast, and that his draftsmanship was perfect. Norman Rockwell at one time considered Leyendecker his primary mentor, as he heavily influenced Rockwell's early style and was a true master illustrator of the 20th century.

By the end of his career, Leyendecker was a noted American illustrator and graphic designer who, between 1896 and 1950, had painted more than 400 magazine covers, most of them of an idealized America. He painted his first Post cover in 1899 and executed 321 more during the next 40 years. Among the most famous of these was his annual New Year Baby series, the last of which was painted in January 1943. It was also his last cover for The Saturday Evening Post.

Many biographers have speculated on J. C. Leyendecker's sexuality, often attributing the apparent homoerotic aesthetic of his work to a homosexual identity. Without question, Leyendecker excelled at depicting male homosocial spaces (locker rooms, clubhouses, tailoring shops) and extraordinarily handsome young men in curious poses or exchanging glances. Moreover, Leyendecker never married, and he lived with another man, Charles Beach, for much of his adult life, who is assumed to have been his lover and who was the original model of the famous Arrow Collar Man

While Beach often organized the famous gala-like social gatherings that Leyendecker was known for in the 1920s, he apparently also contributed largely to Leyendecker's social isolation in his later years. Beach reportedly forbade outside contact with the artist in the last months of his life.

Due to his fame as an illustrator, Leyendecker was able to indulge in a very luxurious lifestyle which in many ways embodied the decadence of the Roaring Twenties. However, when commissions began to wane in the 1930s, he was forced to curtail spending considerably. By the time of his death, Leyendecker had let all of the household staff at his New Rochelle estate go, with he and Beach attempting to maintain the extensive estate themselves. Leyendecker left a tidy estate equally split between his sister and Beach. Leyendecker is buried alongside parents and brother Frank at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. Charles Beach died a few years after Leyendecker, and his burial location is unknown.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/984756004938524/?type=3,2016-03-07 07:07:47,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_983694611711330,"In May 2015, the discovery of missing Nazi-era sculptures during a police raid has cast light on a dark corner of the art market where some collectors pay handsomely for works by artists favored by the former National Socialist regime.

Art was considered to be one of the most important elements to strengthening the Third Reich and purifying the nation. Political aims and artistic expression became one. The task of art in the Third Reich was to shape the population's attitudes by carrying political messages with stereotyped concepts and art forms.

True art as defined by Hitler was linked with the country life, with health, and with the Aryan race. ""We shall discover and encourage the artists who are able to impress upon the State of the German people the cultural stamp of the Germanic race . . . in their origin and in the picture which they present they are the expressions of the soul and the ideals of the community."" (Hitler, Party Day speech, 1935; in Adam, 1992)

Modern art had no place in the Third Reich.

Instead, the role of the artists was to either portray the German world as peaceful, or as drawn into a struggle for survival to defend it. Thus, art was to become one more weapon in the Nazi regime's arsenal. Hitler was a master manipulator, and understood the value of propaganda and artistic fervor. He also understood how to control people by threatening their job, family and existence. Artists who did not fall in with the party ideal risked their life. The artists glorified the German citizens, soldiers, and Hitler's ideals. The painters used their art to depict Hitler as the healing element that would cure the country's ills. They also painted the common ""Volk"" (folk) in everyday settings. The art of this racially pure country was to overcome differences in class and mold all of the people into one ideal. When not painting pastoral scenes or glorifying the war, the artists would turn their paint brushes against the Jew, depicting him as inhuman and inferior.

Arthur Kampf

The most important history painter of the Third Reich.

He studied under Peter Janssen, among others, at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1879 to 1881. After completing his education he became a professor at the Kunstakademie and taught there until 1889, when he moved to Berlin. There he continued to teach at the local Kunstakademie.

From 1915 to 1924 he was president of the Hochschule für Bildende Künste in Berlin. He also became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts.

Kampf joined the Nazi Party soon after the Nazis seized power.[1] In 1939's ""Great German Art Exhibition"" (Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung) at the Haus der Kunst in Munich, he was represented by numerous works.[1] In 1939 he received the Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches with the inscription ""To the German painter"" (Dem deutschen Maler).

In 1944, Kampf was one of 24 artists, architects, authors, composers, actors, and singers added to the ""Special list"" of the Gottbegnadeten list, meaning he was considered absolutely indispensable.

Arthur Kampf was a history painter, and his pictures of historical themes and war scenes were used as propaganda in both World Wars. The NS-Regime in particular celebrated him as a 'Blood and Soil' artist. 
Kampf was represented in the Great German Art exhibition with 18 paintings.
In 1939, on the instructions of Hitler, the GDK mounted a special display of paintings by Arthur Kampf: the Sonderschau. The Sonderschau was a special exhibition that garthered works of a highly valued single artist (one per year) in one room. 
Fifteen works of Arthur Kampf were displayed at the XXIII Venice Biennale, 1942, including: 'Frederico il Grande parla ai suol gerarchi' ('Ansprache Friedrichs des grossen an seine Generäle bei Koeben', GDK 1939),  'Benedizione del volontari' ('Einsegnung Freiwilliger im Jahr 1813', GDK 1939) and 'Il Figlioul Prodigo' ('Rückkehr des Sohnes', GDK 1939).
At the end of the war most of his mural paintings were destroyed. Kampf fled from the advance of the Red Army to Berchtesgaden. After the war he sank into oblivion. 
Arthur Kampf died in 1950, in Castrop-Rauxel.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/983694611711330/?type=3,2016-03-05 06:16:34,10,3,1,10,0,0,0,0,0

I would add that CPAC has itself to blame — and specifically the Tea Party. Jenny Beth Martin released an advance version of her speech this morning, in which she rips Donald Trump in terms no different from Mitt Romney. In the fall, she built Trump up at the rally to stop the Iran deal. That's a significant reversal. 

My guess is that she figured Trump is likely to win the nomination anyway, so pounding him would not hurt, and would preserve the Tea Party's outsider brand. But that speech pushed all the wrong buttons. It almost invited Trump to pull out of CPAC, because it set him up for massive opposition if he dared to show up.

Marco Rubio who is unable to clinch more than one state to date is best according to Marco and the people who work for Marco against Hillary Clinton.  Why?  Who knows ....... but if everyone else died or left the race then he would be able to shine against Hillary  by 3 to 10 points.  All the people who would not vote for him now will do it then, right now they are just holding back.

Also:

If Trump's base is 40 percent, tht is not a majority since 60 percent don't like him and so that 60 percent represents the majority that WOULD go to Marco if all of the other candidates died or dropped out of the race. (never mind tat if Rubio""s base is 10 percent then that means 90 percent can not stand to vote for him - Rubio because that is irrelevant).  

So if 60 percent of the people don't vote for Trump, then a ""majority"" don't want Trump.

In other words, if 60 percent of the people vote for ""other than Trump""  then the winner is...... Not Trump since he ""under-performed"" and the people WANT to vote for Rubio but don't know how to express this to themselves, each other, and because the other candidates have not died or left the race.

After completing a course at Arzamas uezd school, he was transferred to the Alexander Stupin art school also located in Arzamas. In 1853 he was admitted to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where he learned from several renowned artists.

In 1856 he was awarded with a minor silver medal for his sketch of a boy's head, presented to the Imperial Academy of Arts. Later the Academy gave him many other awards: in 1857 a major silver medal for Commissary of Rural Police Investigating, a minor golden medal for the Scene on a Grave and the Son of a Dyak Promoted to First Rank, and in 1861 a major golden medal for Sermon in a Village.

After receiving the right to a state-paid trip abroad together with a golden medal, in 1862 Perov went to Western Europe, visiting several German cities, and then Paris. During this time he created paintings depicting scenes from European street life, such as the Vendor of statuettes, the Savoyard, the Organ-Grinder in Paris, the Musicians and the Bystanders, and the Paris Ragpickers.

Returning to Moscow early, from 1865 to 1871 Perov created his masterpieces The Queue at The Fountain, A Meal in the Monastery, Last Journey, Troika, the Lent Monday, Arrival of a New Governess in a Merchant House, the Drawing Teacher, A Scene at the Railroad, the Last Tavern at Town Gate, the Birdcatcher, the Fisherman, and the Hunters at Rest.

In 1866 he received the title of an academician, and in 1871 the position of a Professor at Moscow School of Arts, Sculpture and Architecture. It was around this period that he joined the Peredvizhniki.

Perov died on 10 June (29 May Old Style), 1882 in the village Kuzminki (now part of Moscow) from tuberculosis.

Colbert sees himself as an apprentice to nature. His works are collaborations between humans and other species that express the poetic sensibilities and imaginations of human and animals. His images offer an inclusive non-hierarchical vision of the natural world, one that depicts an interdependence and symmetry between humanity and the rest of life.In describing his vision, Colbert has said, '""I would define what I do as storytelling…what's interesting is to have an expression in an orchestra—and I'm just one musician in the orchestra. Unfortunately, as a species we've turned our back to the orchestra. I'm all about opening up the orchestra, not just to other humans, but to other species.'""",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/981200805294044/?type=3,2016-02-29 15:38:38,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

At the same time Trump spoke to Christie frequently.
The pair then met at Trump Towers in New York with their wives on Thursday.
On Friday, Christie flew out to Texas and said he would be backing the billionaire.

428053320608798_979853618762096,"Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet (French: [ɡystav kuʁbɛ]; 10 June 1819 – 31 December 1877) was a French painter who led the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His independence set an example that was important to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists. Courbet occupies an important place in 19th-century French painting as an innovator and as an artist willing to make bold social statements through his work.

Courbet's paintings of the late 1840s and early 1850s brought him his first recognition. They challenged convention by depicting unidealized peasants and workers, often on a grand scale traditionally reserved for paintings of religious or historical subjects. Courbet's subsequent paintings were mostly of a less overtly political character: landscapes, seascapes, hunting scenes, nudes and still lifes. He was imprisoned for six months in 1871 for his involvement with the Paris Commune, and lived in exile in Switzerland from 1873 until his death.

Unemployment in Belle Glade is close to 19 percent, and in Pahokee and it's even worse, more like 25 percent, according to CareerSource. Would it really be so difficult for the resort industry to train eager workers and run daily shuttles between the shores of Palm Beach and the shores of Lake Okeechobee? Could they not give American workers an opportunity?

West Palm Beach is about 42 miles from Belle Glade.  The population is rural and predominantly Black and Hispanic, which would be a boon to this population.  However, a plethora of those looking for work have no high-school education and a host of other problems which would make the commute from Belle Glades to West Palm Beach inadvisable for seasonal work.

I say let the man run his business his way...... I am sure he hires when feasible from the local population.  I have been to Mar a Lago many times and I have witnessed the diverse employee population.  The reality is that for people like Rubio or writers for the local paper, a business is an unknown entity.

428053320608798_979163808831077,"An innovative artist, Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born on February 25, 1841, in Limoges, France. He started out as an apprentice to a porcelain painter and studied drawing in his free time. After years as a struggling painter, Renoir helped launch an artistic movement called Impressionism in 1870s. He eventually became one of the most highly regarded artists of his time. He died in Cagnes-sur-Mer, France, in 1919.

Early Years

The son of a tailor and a seamstress, Pierre-Auguste Renoir came from humble beginnings. He was the couple's sixth child, but two of his older siblings died as infants. The family moved to Paris sometime between 1844 and 1846, living near the Louvre, a world-renowned art museum. He attended a local Catholic school.

As a teenager, Renoir became an apprentice to a porcelain painter. He learned to copy designs to decorate plates and other dishware. Before long, Renoir started doing other types of decorative painting to make a living. He also took free drawing classes at a city-sponsored art school, which was run by sculptor Louis-Denis Caillouette.

Using imitation as a learning tool, a nineteen-year-old Renoir started studying and copying some of the great works hanging at the Louvre. He then entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, a famous art school, in 1862. Renoir also became a student of Charles Gleyre. At Gleyre's studio, Renoir soon befriended three other young artists: Frédéric Bazille, Claude Monet, and Alfred Sisley. And through Monet, he met such emerging talents as Camille Pissarro and Paul Cézanne.

Beginning of Career

In 1864, Renoir won acceptance into the annual Paris Salon exhibit. There he showed the painting, ""La Esmeralda,"" which was inspired by a character from Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris. The following year, Renoir again showed at the prestigious Salon, this time displaying a portrait of William Sisley, the wealthy father of artist Alfred Sisley.

While his Salon works helped raise his profile in the art world, Renoir had to struggle to make a living. He sought out commissions for portraits and often depended on the kindness of his friends, mentors, and patrons. The artist Jules Le Coeur and his family served as strong supporters of Renoir's for many years. Renoir also remained close to Monet, Bazille, and Sisley, sometimes staying at their homes or sharing their studios. According to many biographies, he seemed to have no fixed address during his early career.

Around 1867, Renoir met Lise Tréhot, a seamstress who became his model. She served as the model for such works as ""Diana"" (1867) and ""Lise"" (1867). The two also reportedly became romantically involved. According to some reports, she gave birth to his first child, a daughter named Jeanne, in 1870. Renoir never publicly acknowledged his daughter during his lifetime.

Renoir had to take a break from his work in 1870 when he was drafted into the army to serve in France's war against Germany. He was assigned to a cavalry unit, but he soon fell ill with dysentery. Renoir never saw any action during the war, unlike his friend Bazille who was killed that November.

Leader of Impressionism

After the war ended in 1871, Renoir eventually made his way back to Paris. He and some of his friends, including Pissarro, Monet, Cézanne and Edgar Degas, decided to show their works on their own in Paris in 1874, which became known as the first Impressionist exhibition. The group's name is derived from a critical review of their show, in which the works were called ""impressions"" rather than finished paintings done using traditional methods. Renoir, like other Impressionists, embraced a brighter palette for his paintings, which gave them a warmer and sunnier feel. He also used different types of brushstrokes to capture his artistic vision on the canvas.

While the first Impressionist exhibition was not a success, Renoir soon found other supportive patrons to propel his career. The wealthy publisher Georges Charpentier and his wife Marguérite took a great interest in the artist and invited him to numerous social gatherings at their Paris home. Through the Charpentiers, Renoir met such famous writers as Gustave Flaubert and Émile Zola. He also received portrait commissions from the couple's friends. His 1878 painting, ""Madame Charpentier and her Children,"" was featured in the official Salon of the following year and brought him much critical admiration.

International Success

Funded with the money from his commissions, Renoir made several inspirational journeys in the early 1880s. He visited Algeria and Italy and spent time in the south of France. While in Naples, Italy, Renoir worked on a portrait of famed composer Richard Wagner. He also painted three of his masterworks, ""Dance in the Country,"" ""Dance in the City"" and ""Dance at Bougival"" around this time.

As his fame grew, Renoir began to settle down. He finally married his longtime girlfriend Aline Charigot in 1890. The couple already had a son, Pierre, who was born in 1885. Aline served as a model for many of his works, including ""Mother Nursing Her Child"" (1886). His growing family, with the additions of sons Jean in 1894 and Claude in 1901, also provided inspiration for a number of paintings.

As he aged, Renoir continued to use his trademark feathery brushstrokes to depict primarily rural and domestic scenes. His work, however, proved to be more and more physically challenging for the artist. Renoir first battled with rheumatism in the mid-1890s and the disease plagued him for the rest of his life.

Final Years

In 1907, Renoir bought some land in Cagnes-sur-Mer where he built a stately home for his family. He continued to work, painting whenever he could. The rheumatism had disfigured his hands, leaving his fingers permanently curled. Renoir also had a stroke in 1912, which left him in a wheelchair. Around this time, he tried his hand at sculpture. He worked with assistants to create works based on some of his paintings.

The world-renowned Renoir continued to paint until his death. He lived long enough to see one of his works bought by the Louvre in 1919, a tremendous honor for any artist. Renoir died that December at his home in Cagnes-sur-Mer, France. He was buried next to his wife, Aline (who died in 1915), in her hometown of Essoyes, France.

Besides leaving behind over two hundred works of art, Renoir served as an inspiration to so many other artists—Pierre Bonnard, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso are just a few who benefitted from Renoir's artistic style and methods.

428053320608798_979156278831830,"What Happened At the Debate Last night?


First and foremost, Rubio DID NOT win.  It was like watching the action on the playground when the two diminutive brothers gang up on the big kid.  When you add the ""screaming girl plant"" in the audience, it resembled a mix on the playground.  Cruz, regardless of his age was the older brother and Rubio was the younger one with the zingers.  Kasich and Carson were the guys watching.  I don't think anyone viewed Rubio or Cruz in a better light.

When the euphoria from the Trump haters wear off, you will acknowledge that Rubio WOULD be decimated in a general election by his ""light and airy"" accomplishments, intellectual in-curiosity and his inability to manage his personal finances without a ""little help from his friends"".  He behaved like a bantam weight fighter in a heavyweight match and he started swinging up, dancing around and trying to stay hydrated..  And the watch thing was … while funny at first, an appalling stunt obviously written in advance (the website was on the ready) by the ""screamer's"" boyfriend.  The only thing left was for him to take off the big boots and start swinging because when all you have is the ""punch"" and the ""zing"" … that is all you can do. Rubio has never built, led, nor initiated anything – but he has been elected so he has to prove … something.  That fact is not lost on Florida.

On the Cruz front, well …… I am always concerned when people use religion to make a point, make a sale or get elected.  Once you scratch the surface on these types of people you find a pretty messy layer.  He might be a hard worker, but for who and for what end?  I don't think we should use our own needs to write the answer for that question…..

Romney lost his election in 2012.  He did not have the courage to go in for the kill, we thought it was because he was a ""gentleman"", maybe it was just fear.  Romney is a shadow or sideline fighter.  He did not resonate with ….. anyone.  Even his peers were not particularly riveted by his ideas or speeches….. I was a ""face in the crowd"" in some of the Palm Beach events.  So… he swoops in to ""destroy"" the front-runner with the same zinger that had him ""on the ropes"" from, of all people, Harry Reid – who delivered it as a ""face-fighter"".  That will fall on its face since the income tax question and delay is going to feed into several news cycles and possibly bring unwanted attention to …… all of the other candidate's tax returns.  You see, when you dig a ditch for your ""enemy"" …. dig a second for yourself or those you want to help.

Lost in the whole discussion last night, between the silly zingers was this:  The insurance companies DO wield a big influence … too much  because they DO NOT have any restraint or competition – they almost have guaranteed success hence the discussion about the lines. There is a heroin epidemic that will swallow a generation whose parents have everything to offer but them but the kids are not buying anything but despair after being raised with little values and beliefs..  It IS wrong to want people to ""die in the streets"" for lack of funds to pay a doctor.  As a failure of society, there IS an underclass who will believe that the neighborhood Planned Parenthood is the only place where that nagging pain in the abdomen, which turns out to be a ruptured cyst"" or the lump on the breast, that ends up being stage 4 breast cancer, can get get some attention.  This is what happens when the perceived ""outside world"" is everyplace not on your block.  Also lost was the fact that , unfortunately, without a war…… the USA can not prevail upon Putin, the Palestinians, or anywhere without negotiations.  And finally, they all should have responded to Vicente Fox's horrible statement.  Here you have a man that so failed the Mexican people with his inability to lead, and a man who once rode a white horse through a Mexican neighborhood in Chicago then ignored the people in subsequent visits.  A very silly but tall man, insults the USA's sovereignty and  none of the prep people prepared statements for Rubio or Cruz.

The reality is, Donald Trump and his siblings inherited his father's real estate empire worth approximately 200 million at the time now divide that by to total amount of siblings – 5.  I know the ""watch salesman"" quip and website were ""cute"" but that is all it was.  Further, what he did from them was a matter of skill.  I might add that his father inherited nothing and with the help of his mother and his children BUILT the 200 million empire.  This is where you get the REAL understanding of how the wheels of commerce and capitalism work in our society. And it has nothing to do with ""one ups"" or ""quip websites"" or a choreographed screamer.

One thing is……  both Marco and Ted have unnaturally high pitched voices.  ""Houston, we have a problem""

Stay tuned for the next debate…….

Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz potentially violated ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with a Caribbean-based holding company during the 2012 campaign, a review of financial disclosure and company documents by TIME shows. The relationship originated with a $6,000 investment Cruz made more than a decade ago in a Jamaican private equity firm founded by his college roommate.

With Cruz's help, they won the right to control what they hoped would be a $150 million fund. The firm, founded in 1998, lost its contract within five years, in part because of a dispute over an investment decision, and was soon shuttered.

He initially pitched in $6,000 for start-up costs and exited the partnership shortly before it disintegrated with a payout of $25,000, plus a promise of an additional $75,000 to come later, according to Panton.

Cruz's loyalty over many years to Panton, who he has said is ""like a brother,"" shows a different side of a politician who has developed a reputation for being abrasive, even unlikable. Panton, in turn, has been one of Cruz's most enthusiastic political supporters, helping launch the first super PAC backing the senator's White House bid.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/978883435525781/?type=3,2016-02-25 22:11:54,30,11,6,27,0,0,3,0,0

By now, you may have seen the pictures on your social media networks of a real woman who looks just like a real life version of the cartoon character. Her name was Helen Kane. She's undeniably the inspiration for Betty Boop.

But there is quite a bit of evidence showing that Kane stole her schtick from a Black woman named Esther Jones who went by the stage name Baby Esther.

Jones, an African American singer in the late '20's, worked regularly at the Cotton Club in Harlem.

Jones was known for singing in a distinctive baby voice. Her signature song was"" I Wanna Be Loved By You"" where she scatted the lines ""Boop oop a doop.""

According to testimony from Jones' manager, Helen Kane saw Esther Jones' act in 1928.

At some point, Jones learned that Kane was using–or had stolen her style of singing and she took her to court.

A test sound film showed Jones performing which disproved Kane's claims that she was the originator of the style.

A Supreme Court Judge ruled that Kane, the plaintiff had ""failed to sustain either cause of action by proof of sufficient probative force."" In other words, he deduced that the baby technique did not start with Kane.

And Jones was awarded with a $250,000 infringement lawsuit. Sadly, Jones was presumed dead in 1934, just around the time the lawsuit was ending.

So now you know.

Scholar Robert G.

428053320608798_978588975555227,"This month in February 1965:
The great Nathaniel Adams Coles (Nat King Cole) died at the age of 45.
Nat King Cole, was an American singer who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He was widely noted for his soft, baritone voice, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres, becoming a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show, The Nat King Cole Show, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death from lung cancer in February 1965.
Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery, Alabama, on March 17, 1919. Cole had three brothers: Eddie (1910–1970), Ike (1927–2001), and Freddy (born 1931), and a half-sister, Joyce Coles. Each of Cole's brothers would later pursue careers in music as well. When Cole was four years old, he and his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where his father, Edward Coles, became a Baptist minister. Cole learned to play the organ from his mother, Perlina Coles, the church organist. His first performance was of ""Yes! We Have No Bananas"" at four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed ""from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.""
The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago, where he attended Wendel Phillips High School (the same school Sam Cooke would attend a few years later). Cole would sneak out of the house and hang around outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School.
Inspired by the performances of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother, Eddie, a bass player, soon joined Cole's band, and they made their first recording in 1936 under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers at clubs. Cole acquired his nickname, ""King"", performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about ""Old King Cole"". He also was a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. He would later return to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel.
Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, ""Straighten Up and Fly Right"", based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for his fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, proving that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Cole would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence.
""King Cole Trio Time"" on NBC in 1947 with Cole, Oscar Moore and Johnny Miller.
In 1946, the Cole trio paid to have their own 15-minute radio program on the air, called ""King Cole Trio Time"". It became the first radio program sponsored by a black performing artist. During those years, the trio recorded many ""transcription"" recordings, which were recordings made in the radio studio for the broadcast. Later they were used for commercial records.
On November 5, 1956, The Nat King Cole Show debuted on NBC. The variety program was the first of its kind hosted by an African-American, which created controversy at the time. Beginning as a 15-minute pops show on Monday night, the program was expanded to a half hour in July 1957. Despite the efforts of NBC, as well as many of Cole's industry colleagues—many of whom, such as Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Frankie Laine, Mel Tormé, Peggy Lee, Eartha Kitt, and backing vocal group the Cheerleaders, worked for industry scale (or even for no pay) in order to help the show save money—The Nat King Cole Show was ultimately done in by lack of a national sponsorship.Companies such as Rheingold Beer assumed regional sponsorship of the show, but a national sponsor never appeared.
The last episode of The Nat King Cole Show aired December 17, 1957. Cole had survived for over a year, and it was he, not NBC, who ultimately decided to pull the plug on the show.Commenting on the lack of sponsorship his show received, Cole quipped shortly after its demise, ""Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark.
Cole met his first wife, Nadine Robinson, while they were on tour for the all-black Broadway musical Shuffle Along. He was only 17 when they married. She was the reason he landed in Los Angeles and formed the Nat King Cole trio. This marriage ended in divorce in 1948. On March 28, 1948 (Easter Sunday), just six days after his divorce became final, Cole married singer Maria Hawkins Ellington. Although Maria had sung with the Duke Ellington band, she was not related to Duke Ellington. The Coles were married in Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. They had five children:Natalie (1950–2015), who would go on to have a successful career as a singer; adopted daughter Carole (1944–2009, the daughter of Maria's sister), who died of lung cancer at 64; adopted son Nat Kelly Cole (1959–1995), who died of AIDS at 36; and twin daughters Casey and Timolin (born September 26, 1961) whose birth was announced in the milestones column of Time magazine's October 6, 1961 issue along with Melissa Newman's.
Despite conducting extramarital affairs during both of his marriages, Cole was with Maria during his lung cancer illness, and she stayed with him until his death. In an interview, Maria emphasized his musical legacy and the class he exhibited in all other aspects of his life, rather than any lingering bitterness over his infidelity.
Cole was inducted into both the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. In 1990, he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 1997 was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. In 2007, he was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.
An official United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994.
In 2000, Cole was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the major influences on early rock and roll. In 2013, he was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame for his contribution to the Latin music genre.
Cole's success at Capitol Records of recording more than 150 singles on the Billboard's Pop, R&B, and Country Charts has yet to be broken by any Capitol artist. Cole also sold an impressive 50 million records during his career.

Winslow Homer (February 24, 1836 – September 29, 1910) was an American landscape painter and printmaker, best known for his marine subjects. He is considered one of the foremost painters in 19th-century America and a preeminent figure in American art.

Largely self-taught, Homer began his career working as a commercial illustrator. He subsequently took up oil painting and produced major studio works characterized by the weight and density he exploited from the medium. He also worked extensively in watercolor, creating a fluid and prolific oeuvre, primarily chronicling his working vacations.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1836, Homer was the second of three sons of Charles Savage Homer and Henrietta Benson Homer, both from long lines of New Englanders. His mother was a gifted amateur watercolorist and Homer's first teacher. She and her son had a close relationship throughout their lives. Homer took on many of her traits, including her quiet, strong-willed, terse, sociable nature; her dry sense of humor; and her artistic talent. Homer had a happy childhood, growing up mostly in then rural Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was an average student, but his art talent was evident in his early years.

Homer's father was a volatile, restless businessman who was always looking to ""make a killing"". When Homer was thirteen, Charles gave up the hardware store business to seek a fortune in the California gold rush. When that failed, Charles left his family and went to Europe to raise capital for other get-rich-quick schemes that didn't materialize.

After Homer's high school graduation, his father saw a newspaper advertisement and arranged for an apprenticeship. Homer's apprenticeship at the age of 19 to J. H. Bufford, a Boston commercial lithographer, was a formative but ""treadmill experience"".[6] He worked repetitively on sheet music covers and other commercial work for two years. By 1857, his freelance career was underway after he turned down an offer to join the staff of Harper's Weekly. ""From the time I took my nose off that lithographic stone"", Homer later stated, ""I have had no master, and never shall have any.""

Homer's career as an illustrator lasted nearly twenty years. He contributed illustrations of Boston life and rural New England life to magazines such as Ballou's Pictorial and Harper's Weekly[8] at a time when the market for illustrations was growing rapidly and fads and fashions were changing quickly. His early works, mostly commercial engravings of urban and country social scenes, are characterized by clean outlines, simplified forms, dramatic contrast of light and dark, and lively figure groupings — qualities that remained important throughout his career.[9] His quick success was mostly due to this strong understanding of graphic design and also to the adaptability of his designs to wood engraving.

Before moving to New York in 1859, Homer lived in Belmont, Massachusetts with his family. His uncle's Belmont mansion, the 1853 Homer House, was the inspiration for a number of his early illustrations and paintings, including several of his 1860s croquet pictures. The Homer House, owned by the Belmont Woman's Club, is open for public tours.

Homer became a member of The Tile Club, a group of artists and writers who met frequently to exchange ideas and organize outings for painting, as well as foster the creation of decorative tiles. For a short time, he designed tiles for fireplaces.

Homer's nickname in The Tile Club was ""The Obtuse Bard"". Other well known Tilers were painters William Merritt Chase, Arthur Quartley, and the sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens.

Homer started painting with watercolors on a regular basis in 1873 during a summer stay in Gloucester, Massachusetts. From the beginning, his technique was natural, fluid and confident, demonstrating his innate talent for a difficult medium. His impact would be revolutionary. Here, again, the critics were puzzled at first, ""A child with an ink bottle could not have done worse.""[24] Another critic said that Homer ""made a sudden and desperate plunge into water color painting"". But his watercolors proved popular and enduring, and sold more readily, improving his financial condition considerably. They varied from highly detailed (Blackboard – 1877) to broadly impressionistic (Schooner at Sunset – 1880). Some watercolors were made as preparatory sketches for oil paintings (as for ""Breezing Up"") and some as finished works in themselves. Thereafter, he seldom traveled without paper, brushes and water based paints.

As a result of disappointments with women or from some other emotional turmoil, Homer became reclusive in the late 1870s, no longer enjoying urban social life and living instead in Gloucester. For a while, he even lived in secluded Eastern Point Lighthouse (with the keeper's family). In re-establishing his love of the sea, Homer found a rich source of themes while closely observing the fishermen, the sea, and the marine weather. After 1880, he rarely featured genteel women at leisure, focusing instead on working women.

Homer died in 1910 at the age of 74 in his Prouts Neck studio and was interred in the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His painting, Shooting the Rapids, Saguenay River, remains unfinished.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/978564368891021/?type=3,2016-02-25 09:01:33,6,1,0,6,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_978059622274829,"The story goes:

Annie Mae Fultz was 37 years old and pregnant. She was the wife of a poor tenant farmer in North Carolina. During her pregnancy she had grown bigger than what was presumed ""normal"" (her x-rays presumed triplets) and went into town 3 weeks early to have her baby. You see, Annie, her husband (Pete) and their other children lived on a farm outside of town, and with Annie also being deaf and mute, no chances wanted to be taken with her already high risk pregnancy.

The Fultz Quadruplets were born May 23, 1946 at 3 pounds each. The doctor who delivered the children, Fred Klenner,  was a family doctor in a small southern town. He didn't have any of the supplies we have today that are needed when the birth of multiples are involved. There was no incubator so he had to wrap them in cotton gauze blankets and place them very close together.  And... let's not forget that it was 1946, a time of extreme  racial segregation in the South and when blacks had almost no say in even their own lives. So because of this, Klenner took it upon himself to NAME ANNIE'S BABIES!!!! (I know, right?!?!?!) He named them all Mary, followed by names from his own family: Mary Ann (for his wife), Mary Louise (his daughter), Mary Alice (his aunt) and Mary Catherine (his great aunt). The  black nurse who helped deliver the babies recalled not thinking much of it. She is quoted as saying:

""At that time, you know, it was before integration, They did us how they wanted. And these were very poor people. He was a sharecropper, Pete was, and she couldn't read or write.""

It took no time at all before news of the quads spread and soon everyone wanted a piece of the the babies. At a time when baby formula companies were gaining momentum in the white community, many formula companies were looking to strengthen their presence in the black community. Most, if not all blacks were breast feeding at the time because of the simple fact that many could not afford infant formula. What better way to reel in African American business than with 4 beautiful, black baby girls. Borden and Carnation threw their hat in the ring, but in the end it was Pet that Klenner chose to let represent the girls. Klenner was awarded a contract with Pet Milk and made the girls guinea pigs for his ""Vitamin C Therapy"". In exchange for using the girls for promotional purposes, the Fultz's were given a nurse and medical care, food and a farm by Pet.

When the girls had gained enough weight to be deemed healthy, they were set to be discharged from the hospital. The local newspaper announced their discharge with a huge photo of the girls with a caption that read:

Dr. Fred Klenner stated that visitors would be welcome at the home between the hours of 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. each afternoon, and that the quads could be viewed through a glass screen, similar to how we look at animals in a zoo.

Yes, you read right. The girls were to be on display in their own home in their nursery behind a glass wall...

Throughout the years Pet Milk continued to promote their milk with the girls. They were on the covers of almost all of the black magazines at the time and almost every Pet Milk ad had them drinking Pet Milk, baking with Pet Milk and anything else that was thought to get people to buy the milk.

 The girls grew up beautifully, which they probably would have done without the formula. But once the girls reached adulthood things started to unravel. The girls eventually had to be adopted by the nurse that Pet Milk had assigned to them. The farm they were promised turned out to be in the middle of nowhere and on land that wasn't able to grow anything. Eventually the girls were forgotten by the public and lived relatively private lives. And the most tragic of all, all of the girls except one, died of breast cancer before the age of 55. The one surviving sister, the youngest, Mary Catherine also has breast cancer. I have researched her but could find nothing stating whether she survived her cancer battle. As of 2002 she was still alive and well.

This morning I watched the interview with Marco Rubio. He claimed that:
1. Donald Trump was really the loser since in he last election, Romney got 50% of the Nevada Caucus vote.

Answer: A little over 33 thousand people voted in the Nevada Caucus in 2012. Romney received 16,486 votes, which gave him 50.02% of the vote. However, that amount of votes in 2016 would give Romney a solid third place finish.

Further:  Trump received more votes than the ENTIRE  turnout in 2012.

2. ""If it were a two person race"" he implied that he would be ahead. In other words, if everyone dropped out and ALL of the other votes went to Marco Rubio...... then he would win.

Despite his inability to read and write, teachers and administrators not only let Jones play basketball, they let him graduate from high school. It did not matter that he was kept in the special education programs and then thrust into basketball games. He could help teams win.

""He was just kind of kicked through the system in middle school, high school ... Very few people even bothered to find out that he was illiterate because he was so good at basketball.""

428053320608798_977411895672935,"Born on January 15, 1890, Hayden was originally called Peyton Cole Hedgeman. He was given the name Palmer Hayden by his commanding sergeant during World War I. He grew up in the town of Widewater, Virginia, and was a self-trained artist.Hayden was one of the first in America to depict African subjects in his paintings.

Hayden began to draw as a small child, and was inspired to start drawing by his older brother. He enjoyed drawing landscapes of the surrounding countryside. Hayden had a dream of becoming a fiddle player, and told art historian Harry Henderson thet he regretted all of his life not pursuing this dream. His family could not afford a fiddle, and he was simply too timid to follow his dream. Midnight at the Crossroads is an oil painting that reflects Hayden's harsh conflict between becoming a painter and becoming a fiddle player.

Hayden moved to Washington DC to find work when he reached adolescence. He became an errand boy and porter. He started to draw fishing and sailboats, which he was around constantly during his workday. When he started to pursue an art career, he ran into his first encounters with racism. Hayden placed an ad in the local paper for an artist's assistant, but was rejected when he showed up for the interview because he was black.

Hayden Later became a laborer for the Buffalo Bill Circus, then the Ringling Brothers Circus. Afterwards, he joined the army's black Company a, 24th Infantry regiment, and was stationed in the Philippines.[2] He later worked as a deliveryman at West Point Academy during WW1. He moved to Greenwich Village after he was discharged to pursue a career in fine arts. While pursuing his slowly growing art career, he worked as a postal clerk, janitor, and a variety of other part-time jobs. In 1925 and 1926, Hayden's work appeared at the Society of Independent Artists and his very first solo show was in April 1926 at the Civic Club. In 1937, Hayden created The Janitor Who Paints. Despite his artistic success and popularity in Europe, Hayden was still attacked by the press for his early life as a janitor who had little to no artistic training: ""...for years, Palmer C. Hayden, a negro, has been cleaning houses and washing windows to make a living, and during his spare time has gone back to his room at 29 Greenwich Avenue to dabble in oil colors and paint coast and river scenes that appealed to him. Yesterday he received the first prize in fine arts from the Harmon Foundation…. He painted for the fun of it and not because he hoped to win any great appreciation of his efforts.""

As a young man, Hayden studied at the Cooper Union in New York City and also practiced independent studies at Boothbay Art Colony in Maine.  When Hayden was aged 36, he won $400 and a gold medal for his painting Schooners. He submitted five paintings total to the Harmon Arts Foundation. A New York Times headline reads, ""Negro Worker Wins Harmon Art Prizes: Gold Medal and $400 Awarded to Man who Washes Windows to Have Time to Paint"".[5] The Harmon Foundation and the commission on race relations of the federal council of churches, which was in charge of the foundation's awards program was making a rather dramatic statement by selecting Hayden's work for the award. The fact that such an award was given to a janitor with very little formal training emphasized how limited the opportunities were for a black man at the time. Also, the award launched his career as an artist.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/977411895672935/?type=3,2016-02-23 07:24:57,15,2,0,15,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_976784085735716,"Father and Mother Devine and   the International Peace Mission movement, 

Father Divine (c. 1876 – September 10, 1965), also known as Reverend M. J. Divine, was an African American spiritual leader from about 1907 until his death. His full self-given name was Reverend Major Jealous Divine, and he was also known as ""the Messenger"" early in his life. He founded the International Peace Mission movement, formulated its doctrine, and oversaw its growth from a small and predominantly black congregation into a multiracial and international church.

Father Divine claimed to be God. Some contemporary critics also claimed he was a charlatan, and some suppose him to be one of the first modern cult leaders.[citation needed] However, Father Divine made numerous contributions toward his followers' economic independence and racial equality. Father Divine was a contemporary of other religious leaders at that time such as Daddy Grace, Charles Harrison Mason, Noble Drew Ali and James F. Jones, also known as Prophet Jones. Another minister by the name of Jones would play a significant part in a brief struggle to gain control of the Peace Mission following Divine's death - Jim Jones, leader of the ""apostolic socialist"" movement Peoples Temple.

Newspapers in the 1930s had to dig up his probable given name: George Baker. (This name is not recognized by the Library of Congress, and from 1979, there is no further use of that name as a heading for Father Divine in libraries' catalogs.)  Federal Bureau of Investigation files record his name as George Baker alias ""God"".

In 1936 Eliza Mayfield claimed to be Father Divine's mother. She stated that his real name was Frederick Edwards from Hendersonville, North Carolina, and had abandoned a wife and five children, though Mayfield offered no proof and claimed to not remember his father's name. (Father Divine replied that ""God has no Mother."")

His birthplace was originally listed as an African American enclave of Rockville, Maryland, called Monkey Run.  Most researchers agree that Father Divine's parents were freed African American slaves. 

Father Divine was probably called George Baker around the turn of the century. He worked as a gardener in Baltimore, Maryland. In a 1906 sojourn in California, Father Divine became acquainted with the ideas of Charles Fillmore and the New Thought Movement, a philosophy of positive thinking that would inform his later doctrines. Among other things, this belief system asserted that negative thoughts led to poverty and unhappiness. Songwriter Johnny Mercer credited a Father Divine sermon for inspiring the title of his song ""Accentuate the Positive"".

In his late 20s, Father Divine became Morris's first follower and adopted a pseudonym, ""The Messenger"". The Messenger was a Christ figure to Morris's God the Father. Father Divine preached with Morris in Baltimore out of the home of former evangelist Harriette Snowden, who came to accept their divinity. Morris began calling himself ""Father Jehovia.""

He was soon joined by another friend and they became the God trio but that soon collapsed.  Father Divine had finally parted ways with his former associates. Denying that Father Jehovia was God, and saying that everyone could not be God, he declared that he himself was God, and the only true expression of God's spirit.

Father Divine traveled south, where he preached extensively in Georgia. In 1913, conflicts with local ministers got him sentenced to 60 days in a chain gang. While he was serving his sentence, several prison inspectors were injured in an auto accident, which he viewed as the direct result of their disbelief.

Upon release, he attracted a following of mostly black women in Valdosta, Georgia. He taught celibacy and the rejection of gender categorizations.

On February 6, 1914, several followers' husbands and local preachers had Divine arrested for lunacy. (Back then you could not freely be a lunatic) This actually expanded his ministry, with reporters and worshipers deluging his prison cell. Some whites even began calling on him. Former Mercer University professor and lay preacher, J. R. Moseley of Macon, Georgia, befriended Divine and arranged for J. B. Copeland, a Mercer alum and respected Valdosta lawyer, to represent him pro bono. 

In 1914, Father Divine traveled to Brooklyn, New York, with a very modest number of followers and an all-black congregation. Although he claimed to be God incarnate fulfilling Biblical prophecy, he lived relatively quietly.

He and his disciples formed a commune in a black middle-class apartment building. He forbade sex, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling among those who were living with him. By 1919, he had adopted the name Reverend Major Jealous Divine. ""Reverend Major"" was chosen as a title of respect and authority, while ""Jealous"" was a reference to Exodus 34:14, where the Lord says he is a ""jealous god"". His followers affectionately called him Father Divine.

At this time he found an old woman to get married to, her name was Penninah.  Penninah served to defuse rumors of impropriety between him and his many young female followers. Both Penninah, who was often called ""Mother Divine"", and Father Divine would assert that the marriage was never physically consummated.

Father Divine and his disciples moved to Sayville, New York (on Long Island), in 1919. He and his followers were the first black homeowners in town. Father Divine purchased his 72 Macon Street house from a resident who wanted to spite the neighbor he was feuding with. The two neighbors, both German Americans, began fighting when one of them changed his name from Felgenhauer to Fellows in response to anti-German sentiment. His neighbor taunted him, and the feud escalated until Fellows decided to move. As a final insult, he specifically advertised his home for sale to a ""colored"" buyer to presumably lower his neighbors' property values.

In this period, his movement underwent sustained growth. Father Divine held free weekly banquets and helped newcomers find jobs. He began attracting many white followers as well as black. The integrated environment of Father Divine's communal house and the apparently flaunted wealth of his Cadillac infuriated neighbors. Members of the overwhelmingly white community accused him of maintaining a large harem and engaging in scandalous sex, although the Suffolk County district attorney's office found the claims baseless. Nonetheless, neighbors continued to complain.

Father Divine moved to Harlem, New York, where he had accumulated significant following in the black community. Members, rather than Father Divine himself, held most deeds for the movement, but they contributed toward Father Divine's comfortable lifestyle. Purchasing several hotels, which they called ""Heavens"", members could live and seek jobs inexpensively. The movement also opened several budget enterprises, including restaurants and clothing shops, that sold cheaply by cutting overhead. These proved very successful in the depression. Economical, cash-only businesses were actually part of Father Divine's doctrine

By 1934, branches had opened in Los Angeles, California, and Seattle, Washington, and gatherings occurred in France, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia, but the membership totals were drastically overstated in the press. Time Magazine estimated nearly two million followers, but the true figure of adherents was probably a few tens of thousands and a larger body of sympathizers who attended his gatherings. Nonetheless, Father Divine was increasingly called upon to offer political endorsements, which he initially did not grant. For example, New York mayoral candidates John P. O'Brien and Fiorello H. LaGuardia each sought his endorsement in 1933, but Father Divine was apparently uninterested.

In 1944, singer/songwriter Johnny Mercer came to hear of one of Divine's sermons. The subject was ""You got to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative."" Mercer said, ""Wow, that's a colorful phrase!""[6][7] He went back to Hollywood and got together with songwriter Harold Arlen (""Over The Rainbow""), and together they wrote ""Ac-cent-tchu-ate The Positive"", which was recorded by Mercer himself and the Pied Pipers in 1945. It was also recorded by Bing Crosby with the Andrews Sisters that same year.

He had become ""mainstream"".  

After his first wife died, Father Divine married a 21 year old white woman called Edna Rose Ritchings in Washington, D.C., on April 29, 1946. Sure, he was approximately 70 years old at the time, but ""God"" as he liked to call himself really is ""ageless"".  Most followers rejoiced, and the marriage date became a celebrated anniversary in the movement.  Besides, He claimed that Edna, later called ""Mother S. A. Divine"", was the reincarnation of Penninah..... so it was cool.

In 1953, follower John Devoute gave Father Divine Woodmont, a 72-acre (0.3 km²) hilltop estate in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia. This French Gothic manor served as his home and primary site of his increasingly infrequent banquets until his death in 1965.

On September 10, 1965, Father Divine died of natural causes at his Woodmont estate. His widow and remaining followers insist his spirit is still alive and always refer to Father Divine in the present tense. Believers keep the furnishings of Father Divine's personal rooms at Woodmont just as they were as a shrine to his life.

Upon his death in 1965, she became the official leader of the movement, a position she continues to hold. The Movement has nearly dwindled to extinction because few new converts have joined and Peace Mission doctrine forbids sex.  A real problem.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/976784085735716/?type=3,2016-02-22 08:12:20,17,3,3,17,0,0,0,0,0

These seemingly mundane photographs from the 30's and 40's document the richness of the American heritage.  Worth savoring and holding in our memory banks.

Russell Lee (July 21, 1903, Ottawa, Illinois – August 28, 1986, Austin, Texas) was an American photographer and photojournalist, best known for his work for the Farm Security Administration (FSA). His technically excellent images documented the ethnography of various American classes and cultures.

Lee grew up in Ottawa, Illinois and went to the Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana for high school. He earned a degree in chemical engineering from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
He gave up an excellent position as a chemist to become a painter. Originally he used photography as a precursor to his painting, but soon became interested in photography for its own sake, recording the people and places around him. Among his earliest subjects were Pennsylvanian bootleg mining and the Father Divine cult.

In the fall of 1936, during the Great Depression, Lee was hired for the federally sponsored Farm Security Administration (FSA) photographic documentation project of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. He joined a team assembled under Roy Stryker, along with Dorothea Lange, Arthur Rothstein and Walker Evans. Stryker provided direction and bureaucratic protection to the group, leaving the photographers free to compile what in 1973 was described as ""the greatest documentary collection which has ever been assembled.""[2] Lee created some of the iconic images produced by the FSA, including photographic studies of San Augustine, Texas in 1939, and Pie Town, New Mexico in 1940. Over the spring and summer of 1942, Lee was one of several government photographers to document the eviction of Japanese Americans from the West Coast, producing over 600 images of families waiting to be removed and their later life in various detention facilities.[3]
After the FSA was defunded in 1943, Lee served in the Air Transport Command (ATC), during which he took photographs of all the airfield approaches used by the ATC to supply the Armed Forces in World War II. He worked for the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) in 1946 and 1947, helping the agency compile a medical survey in the communities involved in mining bituminous coal. He created over 4,000 photographs of miners and their working conditions in coal mines.[4] In 1946, Lee completed a series of photos focused on a Pentecostal Church of God in a Kentucky coal camp.[5]
While completing the DOI work, Lee also continued to work under Stryker, producing public relations photographs for Standard Oil of New Jersey. Some 80,000 of those photographs have been donated by Exxon Corporation to the University of Louisville in Kentucky.
In 1947 Lee moved to Austin, Texas and continued photography. In 1965 he became the first instructor of photography at the University of Texas.
In addition to the materials at the University of Louisville, other important collections of Lee's work are held by the New Mexico Museum of Art,[6] Wittliff collections, Texas State University[7] and the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin.[",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/976762035737921/?type=3,2016-02-22 07:20:51,2,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

His black-and-white landscape photographs of the American West, especially Yosemite National Park, have been widely reproduced on calendars, posters, and books.
With Fred Archer, Adams developed the Zone System as a way to determine proper exposure and adjust the contrast of the final print. The resulting clarity and depth characterized his photographs. Adams primarily used large-format cameras because their high resolution helped ensure sharpness in his images.
Adams founded the photography group known as Group f/64 along with fellow photographers Willard Van Dyke and Edward Weston. wikipedia",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/976120195802105/?type=3,2016-02-21 08:35:03,31,2,2,31,0,0,0,0,0

In March 1993, photographer Kevin Carter made a trip to southern Sudan, where he took now iconic photo of a vulture preying upon an emaciated Sudanese toddler near the village of Ayod. Carter said he waited about 20 minutes, hoping that the vulture would spread its wings. It didn't. Carter snapped the haunting photograph and chased the vulture away. (The parents of the girl were busy taking food from the same UN plane Carter took to Ayod).

The photograph was sold to The New York Times where it appeared for the first time on March 26, 1993 as 'metaphor for Africa's despair'. Practically overnight hundreds of people contacted the newspaper to ask whether the child had survived, leading the newspaper to run an unusual special editor's note saying the girl had enough strength to walk away from the vulture, but that her ultimate fate was unknown. Journalists in the Sudan were told not to touch the famine victims, because of the risk of transmitting disease, but Carter came under criticism for not helping the girl. ""The man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering might just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene,""

Carter eventually won the Pulitzer Prize for this photo, but he couldn't enjoy it. ""I'm really, really sorry I didn't pick the child up,"" he confided in a friend.

The Pope, himself, sleeps behind massive walls and the Vatican is VERY restrictive regarding the rights of citizenship, reserving Citizenship to only the connected and elite of the land.........  And HE is a Christian.

According to the Pope:  ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,"" Francis told reporters while flying home from his six-day visit to Mexico, which included mass at the U.S. border.

And yet:  The large physical wall around the Vatican is mirrored by the wall of a strict immigration policy. Despite having almost 800 residents, the Vatican only has about 450 citizens, with citizenship generally limited to resident cardinals, diplomats and a handful of resident employees and their families.

In June 2001 — three months before the attack committed by Arabs on U.S. commercial airlines — the Bush administration undertook a study to ensure that Arabs were not being disproportionately stopped by airport security.

When U.S. Airways ticket agent Michael Tuohey laid eyes on Mohamed Atta on the morning of 9/11, he got a ""chill"" and thought to himself, ""If this guy doesn't look like an Arab terrorist, then nothing does."" But then, he says, he gave himself a politically correct ""slap,"" and handed Atta his ticket.

It's not just George W. Bush's open-borders policy that cries out for re-examination. During a debate with Al Gore one year before the 9/11 attack — committed by Arabs on U.S. commercial airlines — he pre-emptively denounced the racial profiling of Arabs by airport security.

428053320608798_973010606113064,"Maggie Lena Walker (July 15, 1864 – December 15, 1934) was an African-American teacher and businesswoman. Walker was the first female bank president of any race to charter a bank in the United States.[1] As a leader, she achieved successes with the vision to make tangible improvements in the way of life for African Americans and women. Disabled by paralysis and limited to a wheelchair later in life, Walker also became an example for people with disabilities.

Walker's restored and furnished home in the historic Jackson Ward neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia has been designated a National Historic Site, operated by the National Park Service.

According to biographical material she supplied, Walker was born as Maggie Lena Mitchell in Richmond, Virginia, to Eccles Cuthbert and Elizabeth Draper Mitchell two years and two months after the end of the American Civil War. Census information, as well as a diary passage saying that she was four years old on her mother's wedding in May 1868, with William Mitchell, set the date back to 1864 or 1865.[2] Her mother was a former slave and an assistant cook in the Church Hill mansion of Elizabeth Van Lew, who had been a spy in the Confederate capital city of Richmond for the Union during the War, and was later postmistress for Richmond. Her father was a butler and writer.

The Mitchell family moved to their own home on College Alley off of Broad Street nearby Miss Van Lew's home where Maggie and her brother Johnnie were raised. The house was near the First African Baptist Church which, like many black churches at the time, was an economic, political, and social center for the local black community.After the untimely death of William Mitchell, Maggie's mother supported her family by working as a laundress. Young Maggie attended the newly formed Richmond Public Schools and helped her mother by delivering the clean clothes.

She taught grade school for three years until 1886, when she married Armstead Walker Jr., a brick contractor. Her husband earned a good living, and she was able to leave teaching to take care of her family and her work with the Independent Order of St. Luke. Maggie and Armstead Walker Jr. had sons, Russell and Melvin, and purchased a home in 1904.

When she was fourteen years old, young Maggie joined the local council of the Independent Order of St. Luke. This fraternal burial society, established in 1867 in Baltimore, Maryland, administered to the sick and aged, promoted humanitarian causes and encouraged individual self-help and integrity. She served in numerous capacities of increasing responsibility for the Order, from that of a delegate to the biannual convention to the top leadership position of Right Worthy Grand Secretary in 1899, a position she held until her death.

In 1902, she published a newspaper for the organization, The St. Luke Herald. Shortly thereafter, she chartered the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. Mrs. Walker served as the bank's first president, which earned her the recognition of being the first black woman to charter a bank in the United States. Later she agreed to serve as chairman of the board of directors when the bank merged with two other Richmond banks to become The Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, which grew to serve generations of Richmonders as an African-American owned institution.

Tragedy struck in 1915 when her husband was accidentally killed, leaving Mrs. Walker to manage a large household. Her work and investments kept the family comfortably situated. When her sons married they brought their wives to 1101⁄2 East Leigh Street, her home in Richmond's Jackson Ward district, the center of Richmond's African-American business and social life around the start of the 20th century.

Walker received an honorary master's degree from Virginia Union University in 1923, and was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2002.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/973010606113064/?type=3,2016-02-15 22:33:56,146,18,41,146,0,0,0,0,0

Story of the painting:  WHY WE NO LONGER MAKE POTS
ARTIST: ANELECIA HANNAH BROOKS

Traditional Ojibwe Story:
Long ago, in a village near the banks of the great salt lakes, lived an old woman. She kept a separate birch bark studio just for making pottery. In the studio on a high shelf were three beautiful pots. If any of the village women wanted to make a pot, she would first go and visit the pots on the high shelf, to be inspired. Everyone knew the pots were sacred, and the old woman did not allow anyone to touch them. One day, all the women left the village together to pick berries. Three little girls hadn't finished their chores, so they were left behind. As soon as all the women had left, the girls scurried to finish their chores and went to the studio to take the sacred pots down from the shelf to play with them. As one of the little girls ran to the blanket they'd laid out in the grass, she tripped and fell. The pots shattered into a thousand pieces. The little girls turned into crows. This is why we no longer make pots, but there are crows everywhere.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/972881936125931/?type=3,2016-02-15 15:46:08,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0

Outraged by that disconnect – which is fueled by Clinton's huge advantage with Democratic superdelegates, who are not bound by voting results – Sanders supporters are fighting back.

428053320608798_972138239533634,"Philip Howard Francis Dixon Evergood (born Howard Blashki; 1901–1973) was an American painter, etcher, lithographer, sculptor, illustrator and writer. He was particularly active during the Depression and World War II era.

Philip Evergood was born in New York City. His mother was English and his father, Miles Evergood, was an Australian artist who, in 1915, changed his name from Blashki to Evergood. Philip Evergood's formal education began in 1905. He studied music and by 1908 he was playing the piano in a concert with his teacher.

He attended different English boarding schools starting in 1909 and was educated mainly at Eton and Cambridge University. In 1921 he decided to study art, left Cambridge, and went to London to study with Henry Tonks at the Slade School.

In 1923 Evergood went back to New York where he studied at the Art Students League of New York for a year. He then returned to Europe, worked at various jobs in Paris, painted independently, and studied at the Académie Julian, both with André Lhote and with Stanley William Hayter; Hayter taught him engraving.

He returned to New York in 1926 and began a career that was marked by the hardships of severe illness, an almost fatal operation, and constant financial trouble.

It was not until the collector Joseph H. Hirshhorn purchased several of his paintings that he could consider his financial troubles over. Evergood worked on WPA art projects from 1934 to 1937 where he painted two murals: The Story of Richmond Hill (1936–37, Public Library branch, Queens, N.Y.) and 'Cotton from Field to Mill (1938, post office in Jackson, Ga.). He taught both music and art as late as 1943, and finally moved to Southbury, Connecticut, in 1952. He was a full member of the Art Students League of New York and the National Institute of Arts and Letters. He was killed in a house fire in Bridgewater, Connecticut, in 1973 at the age of 72.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/972138239533634/?type=3,2016-02-14 09:44:41,12,1,2,12,0,0,0,0,0

Well, in the overall delegate count, Clinton holds a commanding lead after a razor-thin victory in Iowa and a shellacking in New Hampshire. Clinton has 394 delegates, both super and electorally assigned, to only 42 for Sanders.

The truth is that there are a total of  712 superdelegates in total, and they can each pledge their support to whomever they please. And the person they ""please"" will be Hilliary Clinton, for the most part.  So...... no matter how you vote or how much the Democrats turn out across the United States of America, or how poorly Hilliary does in many of the states, Bernie Sanders really has little chance of winning. Hilliary is already on-third of the way to the nomination.

Her works on paper combine collage, drawing, painting, printmaking, and photo transfers. Akunyili Crosby negotiates the cultural terrain between her adopted home in America and her native Nigeria, creating works that expose the challenges of occupying these two worlds. She has created a sophisticated visual language that pays homage to the history of Western painting while also referencing African cultural traditions. Akunyili Crosby depicts deeply personal imagery that transcends the specificity of individual experience and engages in a global dialogue about trenchant social and political issues. Wiki

She lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. She's a recent MFA Yale University graduate, yet she's already achieving greatness in the competitive visual arts industry. She was selected for the prestigious Studio Harlem residency program in 2011-2012.  

Njideka's work conveys a love story, between herself and her American husband Justin Crosby (yeah, he's white). Her creations are quite large in scale and I can understand why — this woman seems to have a lot to say. That's why her work is bold and multi-layered. If you look closely, you'll notice lovely details and reflections of Nigeria (the yellow public buses of Lagos called danfu, the faces of her family and friends, popular Nigerian food products, political figures, etc.) I get  a sense of nostalgia in her work.

428053320608798_970565906357534,"Berthe Marie Pauline Morisot (French: [mɔʁizo]; January 14, 1841 – March 2, 1895) was a painter and a member of the circle of painters in Paris who became known as the Impressionists. She was described by Gustave Geffroy in 1894 as one of ""les trois grandes dames"" of Impressionism alongside Marie Bracquemond and Mary Cassatt.

Morisot was born in Bourges, France, into an affluent bourgeois family. Her father, Edmé Tiburce Morisot, was the prefect (senior administrator) of the department of Cher. Her mother, Marie-Joséphine-Cornélie Thomas, was the great-niece of Jean-Honoré Fragonard, one of the most prolific Rococo painters of the ancien régime. She had two older sisters, Yves (1838–1893) and Edma (1839–1921), plus a younger brother, Tiburce, born in 1848. The family moved to Paris in 1852, when Morisot was a child.

It was common practice for daughters of bourgeois families to receive art education, so Berthe and her sisters Yves and Edma were taught privately by Geoffroy-Alphonse Chocarne and Joseph Guichard. In 1857 Guichard introduced Berthe and Edma to the Louvre gallery where they could learn by looking, and from 1858 they learned by copying paintings. He also introduced them to the works of Gavarni.

Morisot's first appearance in the Salon de Paris came at the age of twenty-three in 1864, with the acceptance of two landscape paintings. She continued to show regularly in the Salon, to generally favorable reviews, until 1873, the year before the first Impressionist exhibition. She exhibited with the Impressionists from 1874 onwards, only missing the exhibition in 1878 when her daughter was born.

Morisot was married to Eugène Manet, the brother of her friend and colleague Édouard Manet, from 1874 until his death in 1892. In 1878 she gave birth to her only child, Julie, who posed frequently for her mother and other Impressionist artists, including Renoir and her uncle Édouard.

Morisot died on 2 March 1895, in Paris, of pneumonia contracted while attending to her daughter Julie's similar illness, and thus orphaning her at the age of 16. She was interred in the Cimetière de Passy.

She was in on sliming her husband's ex-girlfriends who told the truth about liaisons. She has long been driven by a fear of being ""dead broke,"" as she put it — and a conviction that she deserved the life and perks she would have had if she had gone into the private sector. That led her to do her suspiciously lucrative commodity trades while Bill was Arkansas attorney general and to make Wall Street speeches on the cusp of her 2016 campaign, even though she and Bill had already made more than $139 million between 2007 and 2014.

428053320608798_968049219942536,"Jack Vettriano OBE born Jack Hoggan (born 17 November 1951), is a Scottish painter. His 1992 painting, The Singing Butler, became a best selling image in Britain.

Jack Vettriano grew up in the industrial seaside town of Methil, Fife. He was raised in poverty with his mother and father and older brother, in a spartan miner's cottage, sharing a bed with his brother and wearing hand-me-down clothes. From the age of 10, his father sent him out delivering papers and milk, cleaning windows, picking potatoes and any job that would earn money. His father took half his earnings.

Vettriano left school at 16 and later became an apprentice mining engineer. For a short time in the late 1960s he had a summer job as a bingo caller at the Beachcomber Amusements on Leven Promenade. Vettriano took up painting as a hobby in the 1970s, when a girlfriend bought him a set of watercolours for his 21st birthday.His earliest paintings, under his birth name ""Jack Hoggan"", were copies or pastiches of impressionist paintings; his first painting was a copy of Monet's Poppy Fields. Much of his influence came from studying paintings at the Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery. In 1984, Vettriano first submitted his work to the Shell-sponsored art exhibition in the museum.

In 1987, at 36, Vettriano's wife Gail left him. He quit his job in educational research, and moved to Edinburgh where he adopted his mother's maiden name. He applied to study Fine Art at the University of Edinburgh, but his portfolio was rejected.

After many years and trials, perseverance paid off.  In February 2012, Vettriano's most famous painting, The Singing Butle - the painting here, went on display at the Aberdeen Art Gallery as part of an exhibition entitled, 'From Van Gogh to Vettriano'.

In September 2013, a major retrospective of Vettriano's work opened at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. 'Jack Vettriano: A Retrospective' ran until 23 February 2014 and featured over 100 works.

He has been criticized.......  According to The Daily Telegraph he has been described as the Jeffrey Archer of the art world, a purveyor of ""badly conceived soft porn"",[31] and a painter of ""dim erotica"",[32] According to Vanity Fair, critics say Jack Vettriano paints brainless erotica.[9] Sandy Moffat, head of drawing and painting at Glasgow School of Art, said: ""He can't paint, he just colours in.""[33] The Guardian's art critic Jonathan Jones, described Vettriano's paintings as a group as ""brainless"" and said Vettriano ""is not even an artist."".

Whatever......  everyone has a mouth and they have got to use it to day or do one thing or another.....  but I love his paintings and I hope that you will enjoy this one also.  

He has set up the Vettriano Trust, and plans to leave his money to it to do good work.s.   He has no children and is divorced.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/968049219942536/?type=3,2016-02-06 14:54:12,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

I feel sorry for this child but children have to cope with bad behavior from peers and taunts.

Within moments every one of the 2000 students knew and for months i received socks on my desk. ........

John Koch, born in Toledo, Ohio in 1909, was an American realist best known for his paintings of fashionable Manhattan and New England mansion dwellers.

Koch's early art training was minimal. He attended two summers at the artists' colony at Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he was influenced by the work and theory of Charles Hawthorne. After graduating from high school, he went to Paris, where he stayed for four years painting on his own, never under a teacher. As he later recalled, ""the Louvre taught me my major lessons."" 

At a time when the world seemed to turn its back on the realist tradition, Koch persisted and presented intimate views of his personal world.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/967526229994835/?type=3,2016-02-05 14:00:31,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_966869316727193,"Happy Birthday to:  Elizabeth Blackwell, first woman to get an MD from a U.S. medical school.

Elizabeth Blackwell (3 February 1821 – 31 May 1910) was a British-born physician, notable as the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States, as well as the first woman on the UK Medical Register. She was the first woman to graduate from medical school, a pioneer in promoting the education of women in medicine in the United States, and a social and moral reformer in both the United States and in the United Kingdom. Her sister Emily was the third woman in the US to get a medical degree.

In October 1847, Blackwell was accepted as a medical student by Hobart College, then called Geneva Medical College, located in upstate New York. Her acceptance was a near-accident. The dean and faculty, usually responsible for evaluating an applicant for matriculation, were not able to make a decision due to the special nature of Blackwell's case. They put the issue up to vote by the 150 male students of the class with the stipulation that if one student objected, Blackwell would be turned away. The young men voted unanimously to accept her.

On January 23, 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to achieve a medical degree in the United States. The local press reported her graduation favourably, and when the dean, Dr. Charles Lee, conferred her degree, he stood up and bowed to her.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/966869316727193/?type=3,2016-02-04 08:02:18,58,1,8,58,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_966835626730562,"Pierre Bonnard (French: [bɔnaʁ]; 3 October 1867 – 23 January 1947) was a French painter and printmaker, as well as a founding member of the Post-Impressionist group of avant-garde painters Les Nabis. Bonnard preferred to work from memory, using drawings as a reference, and his paintings are often characterized by a dreamlike quality. The intimate domestic scenes, for which he is perhaps best known, often include his wife Marthe de Meligny.

Bonnard has been described as ""the most thoroughly idiosyncratic of all the great twentieth- century painters"", and the unusual vantage points of his compositions rely less on traditional modes of pictorial structure than voluptuous color, poetic allusions and visual wit.

Bonnard is known for his intense use of color, especially via areas built with small brush marks and close values. His often complex compositions—typically of sunlit interiors of rooms and gardens populated with friends and family members—are both narrative and autobiographical. His wife Marthe was an ever-present subject over the course of several decades. She is seen seated at the kitchen table, with the remnants of a meal; or nude, as in a series of paintings where she reclines in the bathtub. He also painted several self-portraits, landscapes, street scenes, and many still lifes, which usually depicted flowers and fruit. wiki",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/966835626730562/?type=3,2016-02-04 07:20:14,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0

the National Reich Church of Germany would claim exclusive control over all churches:

>crucifixes, Bibles and saints were to be removed from altars

>Mein Kampf would be placed on altars as ""to the German nation and therefore to God the most sacred book""

428053320608798_965546733526118,"Today in History:  1976  Ernesto Miranda, famous from the Supreme Court ruling on Miranda vs. Arizona is stabbed to death. 

Who was Ernesto Miranda?

Ernesto Arturo Miranda was born in Mesa, Arizona on March 9, 1941. Miranda began getting in trouble when he was in grade school. Shortly after his mother died, his father remarried. Miranda and his father didn't get along very well; he kept his distance from his brothers and stepmother as well. Miranda's first criminal conviction was during his eighth grade year. The following year, he was convicted of burglary and sentenced to a year in reform school.

In 1956, about a month after his release from the reform school, Arizona State Industrial School for Boys (ASISB), he fell afoul of the law once more and was returned to ASISB. Upon his second release from reform school he relocated to Los Angeles, California. Within months of his arrival in LA, Miranda was arrested (but not convicted) on suspicion of armed robbery and for some sex offenses. After two and a half years in custody the 18-year-old Miranda was extradited back to Arizona.

He drifted through the South for a few months, spending time in jail in Texas for living on the street without money or a place to live, and was arrested in Nashville for driving a stolen car. Because he had taken the stolen vehicle across state lines, Miranda was sentenced to a year and a day in the federal prison system, serving time in Chillicothe, Ohio and later in Lompoc, California.

The next couple of years Miranda kept out of jail, working at various places, until he became a laborer on the night loading dock for the Phoenix produce company. At that time he started living with Twila Hoffman, a 29-year-old mother of a boy and a girl by another man, from whom she could not afford a divorce

Miranda v. Arizona: Miranda was arrested at his home and taken in custody to a police station where he was identified by the complaining witness. He was then interrogated by two police officers for two hours, which resulted in a signed, written confession. At trial, the oral and written confessions were presented to the jury. Miranda was found guilty of kidnapping and rape and was sentenced to 20-30 years imprisonment on each count. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona held that Miranda's constitutional rights were not violated in obtaining the confession

Issues 

Whether ""statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation"" are admissible against him in a criminal trial and whether ""procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to incriminate himself"" are necessary. 

After Miranda's conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court, the State of Arizona retried him. At the second trial, Miranda's confession was not introduced into evidence. Miranda was once again convicted and sentenced to 20-30 years in prison. 

Because of the ruling, police departments around the country started to issue Miranda warning cards to their officers to recite. They read:

""You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney and to have an attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided to you at no cost. During any questioning, you may decide at any time to exercise these rights, not answer any questions or make any statements. Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you?""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/965546733526118/?type=3,2016-02-01 15:11:45,3,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0

Duane Hanson (January 17, 1925 – January 6, 1996) was an American artist and sculptor from Minnesota who worked in South Florida. He was known for his lifecast realistic works of people, cast in various materials, including polyester resin, fiberglass, Bondo, and bronze. His work is often associated with the Pop Art movement, as well as hyperrealism.

Although detractors may liken his work to figures in a wax museum, the content of his sculptures is more complex and subtly expressive than that normally found in waxworks..

His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the New York School of writers, including John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, and James Schuyler. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on Great Spruce Head Island, Maine and the family home at 49 South Main Street, Southampton, New York.
His painterly vision, which encompassed a fascination with nature and the ability to reveal extraordinariness in ordinary life, was heavily indebted to the French painters Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard.

Benny Andrews was a figural painter in the expressionist style who painted a diverse range of themes of suffering and injustice, including The Holocaust, Native American forced migrations, and most recently, Hurricane Katrina. Other influences on his work include Surrealism and Southern folk art.

428053320608798_963259760421482,"Govert (or Govaert) Teuniszoon Flinck (25 January 1615 – 2 February 1660) was a Dutch painter of the Dutch Golden Age. Born at Kleve, capital of the Duchy of Cleves, which was occupied at the time by the United Provinces, he was apprenticed by his father to a silk mercer, but having secretly acquired a passion for etching and drawing, was sent to Leeuwarden, where he boarded in the house of Lambert Jacobszoon, a Mennonite, better known as an itinerant preacher than as a painter.
Here Flinck was joined by Jacob Backer, and the companionship of a youth determined like himself to be an artist only confirmed his passion for painting. Amongst the neighbours of Jacobszon at Leeuwarden were the sons and relations of Rombertus van Uylenburgh, whose daughter Saskia married Rembrandt in 1634. Other members of the same family lived at Amsterdam, cultivating the arts either professionally or as amateurs. The pupils of Lambert probably gained some knowledge of Rembrandt by intercourse with the Ulenburgs. Certainly Joachim von Sandrart, who visited Holland in 1637, found Flinck acknowledged as one of Rembrandt's best pupils, and living habitually in the house of the dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh at Amsterdam.
For many years Flinck laboured on the lines of Rembrandt, following that master's style in all the works which he executed between 1636 and 1648. With aspirations as a history painter, however, he looked to the swelling forms and grand action of Peter Paul Rubens, which led to many commissions for official and diplomatic painting. Flinck's relations with Cleves became in time very important. He was introduced to the court of the Great Elector, Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg, who possessed the Duchy and who married in 1646 Louisa of Orange. He obtained the patronage of John Maurice of Nassau, who was made stadtholder of Cleves in 1649.
In 1652 a citizen of Amsterdam, Flinck married in 1656 an heiress, Sophie van der Houven, daughter of a director of the Dutch East India Company. Flinck was already well known in the patrician circles over which the brothers Cornelis and Andries de Graeff and the alderman Jan Six presided; he was on terms of intimacy with the poet Joost van den Vondel and the treasurer Johannes Uitenbogaard. In his house, adorned with casts after the Antique, costumes, and a noble collection of prints, he often received the stadtholder John Maurice, whose portrait is still preserved in the work of the learned Caspar Barlaeus. Flinck died in Amsterdam on 2 February 1660.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/963259760421482/?type=3,2016-01-28 06:28:52,11,0,0,11,0,0,0,0,0

Angela Yvonne Davis (born January 26, 1944) is an American political activist, scholar, and author. She emerged as a prominent counterculture activist and radical in the 1960s as a leader of the Communist Party USA, and had close relations with the Black Panther Party through her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement. Her interests included prisoner rights; she founded Critical Resistance, an organization working to abolish the prison-industrial complex. She is a retired professor with the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a former director of the university's Feminist Studies department.

Davis was arrested, charged, tried, and acquitted of conspiracy in the 1970 armed take-over of a Marin County courtroom, in which four persons died.

Her research interests are feminism, African-American studies, critical theory, Marxism, popular music, social consciousness, and the philosophy and history of punishment and prisons. Her membership in the Communist Party led to Ronald Reagan's request in 1969 to have her barred from teaching at any university in the State of California. She was twice a candidate for Vice President on the Communist Party USA ticket during the 1980s.

Her greatest impact was on figural painting, especially portraits and paintings of typical people's lives in rustic or urban places. Since the time she had spent in Berlin, her most important genre became floral still life. Her early work reflects characteristics of München studio-work. The main colors are dark and brownish, only the pastels are light and rosy. From 1889 onwards her painting became lighter with blue nuances, typical for Parisian art at the time.

From here on, many artists took the next step that led into Impressionism, but Ivana Kobilca did not. In the latest period of her work, her ability to create fresh and interesting paintings started to fade. With some exceptions, her works of that period are dull and impersonal.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/962265430520915/?type=3,2016-01-26 07:52:09,11,2,3,11,0,0,0,0,0

Mildred Elizabeth Gillars (November 29, 1900 – June 25, 1988), nicknamed ""Axis Sally"" along with Rita Zucca, was an American broadcaster employed by the Third Reich in Nazi Germany to proliferate propaganda during World War II. She was convicted of treason by the United States in 1949 following her capture in post-war Berlin.

Gillars' main programs from Berlin were:
Home Sweet Home Hour, from December 24, 1942, until 1945,, a regular propaganda program the purpose of which was to make US forces in Europe feel homesick. A running theme of these broadcasts was the infidelity of soldiers' wives and sweethearts while the listeners were stationed in Europe and North Africa.

Opening with the sound of a train whistle, Home Sweet Home attempted to exploit the fears of American soldiers about the home front. The broadcasts were designed to make soldiers cast doubt about their mission, their leaders, and their prospects after the war.

Midge-at-the-Mike, broadcast from March to late fall 1943, in which she played American songs interspersed with defeatist propaganda, anti-Semitic rhetoric and attacks on Franklin D. Roosevelt.

GI's Letter-box and Medical Reports 1944, directed at the US home audience in which Gillars used information on wounded and captured US airmen to cause fear and worry in their families. After D-Day, June 6, 1944, US soldiers wounded and captured in France were also reported on. 

Gillars and Koischwitz worked for a time from Chartres and Paris for this purpose, visiting hospitals and interviewing POWs.,  In 1943 they had toured POW camps in Germany, interviewing captured Americans and recording their messages for their families in the US. The interviews were then edited for broadcast as though the speakers were well-treated or sympathetic to the Nazi cause.

Gillars made her most notorious broadcast on June 5, 1944, just prior to the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, in a radio play written by Koischwitz, Vision Of Invasion. She played Evelyn, an Ohio mother, who dreams that her son had died a horrific death on a ship in the English Channel during an attempted invasion of Occupied Europe.

Koischwitz died in August 1944 and Gillars' broadcasts became lackluster and repetitive without his creative energy. She remained in Berlin until the end of the war. Her last broadcast was on May 6, 1945, just two days before the German surrender.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/961987653882026/?type=3,2016-01-25 16:47:53,17,3,16,17,0,0,0,0,0

The Library of Congress titled the image: ""Destitute pea pickers in California. Mother of seven children. Age thirty-two. Nipomo, California.

While Thompson's identity was not known for over forty years after the photos were taken, the images became famous. The sixth image, especially, which later became known as Migrant Mother, ""has achieved near mythical status, symbolizing, if not defining, an entire era in United States history."" Roy Stryker called Migrant Mother the ""ultimate"" photo of the Depression Era: ""[Lange] never surpassed it. To me, it was the picture ... . The others were marvelous, but that was special ... . She is immortal."" As a whole, the photographs taken for the Resettlement Administration ""have been widely heralded as the epitome of documentary photography.""

Bush, the shorter candidate, didn't win the popular vote against the taller Al Gore. In two of these elections, candidates were the same height. 

So it behooves the candidates to pad the height issue.  McCain was a teenie tiny man and next to Obama it showed.  Remember the television appearance where they were sitting in wing chairs and McCain looked as though he sat in a giant chair?  Rand Paul is petitie as is Rubio and Cruz.

You may not know the name, but you know his work. Yousuf Karsh passed away at the age of 93 on July 3, 2002. He was one of the greatest portrait photographers of the past century: ""A classic rags-to-riches immigrant story [...] Karsh was born in Turkish Armenia, growing up as a Christian in predominantly Muslim Turkey. Karsh was just 14 when the family fled the horror of genocide in Armenia for freedom in Syria.

His most famous portraits include: the 1941 picture of Winston Churchill as an indomitable wartime leader; George Bernard Shaw as quizzical old sage in 1943; Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1946 as a five-star general and Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force; Ernest Hemingway in a turtle-neck sweater in 1957;

Mr Karsh's portraits have been faulted, by those reckless enough to criticise him, for all looking the same: impressive, solemn, usually in black and white to heighten the feeling of drama. It is said he could make the woman next door look like Queen Elizabeth. His admirers retort that this was his style. It was like complaining that Rembrandt's paintings did not make you laugh. No one expressed surprise that Karsh and Rembrandt could be mentioned in the same breath.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/957850970962361/?type=3,2016-01-18 07:03:40,68,4,9,68,0,0,0,0,0

It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.  

The woman in the painting is Anna Christina Olson (3 May 1893 – 27 January 1968). She is known to have suffered from polio, a muscular deterioration that paralyzed her lower body. Wyeth was inspired to create the painting when he saw her crawling across a field while he was watching from a window in the house. Wyeth had a summer home in the area and was on friendly terms with Olson, using her and her younger brother as the subjects of paintings from 1940 to 1968. Although Olson was the inspiration and subject of the painting, she was not the primary model — Wyeth's wife Betsy posed as the torso of the painting. Olson was 55 at the time Wyeth created the work.

The house depicted in the painting is known as the Olson House, and is located in Cushing, Maine",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/956419947772130/?type=3,2016-01-15 12:35:12,2,1,3,2,0,0,0,0,0

""They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump.  Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.""

Bennett did not author this but a good read regardless: 
Former U. S. Secretary of Education , William J. Bennett's frankly candid and shocking observations of Donald Trump's impact on the behavior of the entrenched Washington D. C. bureaucrats in both parties -- and the risk The Donald faces in so doing.

William J. Bennett, Host of Bill Bennett's Morning in America Show, is one of America's most important, influential, and respected voices on cultural, political, and education issues. He has one of the strongest Christian world views of any writer in modern times.

What I See Happening In a Trump Presidency

By Bill Bennett 

They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump.

Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.

It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media. They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it's in all of their interests to protect one another. It's one for all and all for one.

It's a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We're the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened.

Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart. It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It's because most of the other politicians are part of the a good old boys club. They talk big, but they won't change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations - like Big Pharmacy or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock, and barrel by foreigners like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary and their Clinton Foundation donations.

These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. But there's one man who isn't beholden to anyone There's one man who doesn't need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher's union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association to fund his campaign.

Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn't need anyone's help. That means he doesn't care what the media says. He doesn't care what the corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat to those people. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters.

Don't you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don't you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don't you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to de-fund Obamacare or Obama's clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right?

First, I'd guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything.

Ask former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even knew he was withdrawing large sums of his own money from his own bank account. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They surveil everything. Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists, so they are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment. Fourth , why rock the boat? After defeat or retirement, if you're a good old boy, you've got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.

But Trump doesn't play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cozy relationship between big government, big media, and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump. Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama's birth certificate. He questioned Obama's college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university. Now, he's doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do. He's questioning our relationship with Mexico; he's questioning why the border is wide open; he's questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he's questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; he's questioning why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he's questioning why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.

Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question! I'm certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare's architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. Trump will investigate Obama's widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama's college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs report before the 2012 election?

Obama, the multinational corporations and the media need to stop Trump. They recognize this could get out of control. If left unchecked, telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump could wake a sleeping giant. Trump's election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked books and Obama's records, the game is over. The jig is up. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi. The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison.

Obamacare will be de-funded and dismantled. Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved. That's why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.

Yes, it's become open season on Donald Trump. The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his businesses, and, if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. But they can't silence him. And they sure can't intimidate him. The more they try, the more the public will realize that he's the one telling the truth.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/955384677875657/?type=3,2016-01-13 14:34:05,27,14,28,27,0,0,0,0,0

The television is always a constant while I am working.  The news plays 24-7 and since the stock market is not doing so well right now, I pay more attention to the background noise and so far..... at least according to the TV pundits and commericials Marco Rubio is striking fear in the hearts of many....... the unifying reason is his ""handsomeness"".  Pulchritude is an amazing weapon and according to both the male and female pundits he has a good share of it.  

1.  Hillary Clinton, her family and her campaign team....  HE is the ONE she FEARS  the most.....A Hillary Clinton match-up with Marco Rubio is a scary thought for Democrats,"" because he is good looking ...... a bit more than she is.

2.  Jeb Bush is supposedly living in terror of Marco, not for any obvious reasons but because of his ""boyish good looks, a gift for speechmaking.""

3.  I never hear that Cruz is shaking too much in his boots - he once said ""I think Democrats and the media are afraid of Marco Rubio because he is a smart, intelligent, conservative Hispanic. And they are looking for any excuse they can to attack him, because that threatens them,"" ..... Curz also has his own Hispanic roots so they probably nullify the ""fear factor"".He has a more impressive resume' but not as ""handsome"".  

4.  The Telegraph seems to be afraid for the ederly since they stated that  ""Marco Rubio, the 44-year-old senator from Florida"" who is also ""boyishly handsome""  might do something to their Social Security becaue he full of ""youth and energy"" and of course because he is full of ""good looks"".

5.  One author says that ""He's easily the best politician in the GOP field. because the 44 year-old Cuban-American son of a bartender, Rubio has youth, eloquence, and a a photogenic family.

Well..... this is ""silly season"".  The one unifying factor that makes people afraid of a one term Senator with a stint in the Florida legislator is that he looks better than the entire field of contestants - you know the ""boyish good looks"" stuff.  He has never been in the military but after a brief few years in the Senate is is an ""expert"" in Foreign Affairs.  He can speak spanish fluently and wears wickedly beautiful boots.  Oh yeah but then  again..... he is also ""boyishly handsome"" and photogenic... and has ""youth and energy.""

He became a student at the National Academy of Design in New York.His style evolved from realism to expressionism to a powerful folk style for which he is best known.

He spent the late 1920s in France, where he learned about modernism.During this time, he met the Danish textile artist Holcha Krake in Cagnes-sur-Mer. Later that same year, Johnson returned to Europe where he married Holcha Krake.[4 Johnson and his wife spent most of the 1930s in Scandinavia, where his interest in folk art influenced his painting. They returned to the United States in 1938, as Nazi sentiments increased in Germany and Europe.[5] The inter-racial couple were to experience prejudice in the United States as well.n 1941, Johnson held a solo exhibition at Alma Reed Galleries.[2] However, although he enjoyed a degree of success as an artist during the 1940s and 1950s, he was never able to achieve financial stability. In 1942 a fire destroyed his studio, his artwork and his supplies.[2] In 1944 his wife Holcha died from breast cancer. To deal with his grief, he took work in a Navy Yard, and in 1946 left for Denmark to be with his wife's family. Johnson soon fell ill himself, from the effects of advanced syphilis. He returned to New York in 1947 to enter the Central Islip State Hospital on Long Island, where he was treated for syphilis-induced paresis.[9] He spent the last twenty-three years of his life there.[4] He stopped painting in 1956[10] and died on January 1, 1970.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/954013444679447/?type=3,2016-01-10 19:26:34,19,1,0,19,0,0,0,0,0

No way, and I do mean NO WAY is Hillary Clinton going to win the election. ....For many reasons people are not saying this...... political correctness cuts both ways and people seldom say what they think for fear of being called ""sexist"" or ""racist"", but that is the way things work down here in the regular world.....People tell you what you want to hear and then do what they want to do...She will get the feminist vote, however.....maybe.

 So what are they worried about?  Is it the ""Republican Brand""?  No, it can't be since people stayed at home rather than turning out to vote for Romney in what was supposed to be a ""landslide"".  

For years the GOP elites, along with their high-priced consultants, have cynically manipulated the Republican base, constantly promising to deliver on one issue after another, in order to get elected, yet delivering on nothing because there was never the intention of doing so.  

It is a new day.  The Republican Party has signed its own death warrant by stabbing the backs of their voter base so many times it's unfathomable! That's why they are dying! I believe  Trump is the best for this country. Cruz next.

The base is fed up with the ""old guard"" and I expect Trump to sweep the field. He loves the country and has the knowledge, values and skills to get the country moving again after dopey and the dims severely damaged it culturally and economically.  I suspect he will be good enough.

Bill hid behind the skirts of feminists — including his wife and esteemed women in his cabinet — when he got caught playing around. And feminists, eager to protect his progressive agenda on women, allowed the women swirling around Bill to become collateral damage, torched as trailer trash or erotomaniacs.

Trump can be a bully. But Hillary was a bully, too, in the way she dealt with her husband's paramours. Her impulse, as Lewinsky wrote in Vanity Fair, was to blame the woman.

Lucas Cranach the Elder (Lucas Cranach der Ältere, c. 1472 – 16 October 1553) was a German Renaissance painter and printmaker in woodcut and engraving. He was court painter to the Electors of Saxony for most of his career, and is known for his portraits, both of German princes and those of the leaders of the Protestant Reformation, whose cause he embraced with enthusiasm, becoming a close friend of Martin Luther. He also painted religious subjects, first in the Catholic tradition, and later trying to find new ways of conveying Lutheran religious concerns in art. He continued throughout his career to paint nude subjects drawn from mythology and religion. He had a large workshop and many works exist in different versions; his son Lucas Cranach the Younger, and others, continued to create versions of his father's works for decades after his death.

It's just too much.

Bill Clinton is a despicable man, like all sexual predators.  He's also a coward, as the record of his predation shows.  Approaching women in the manner he did to, say, Paula Jones is dangerous.  Women like Paula may have boyfriends or fathers or brothers who would be willing to physically assault anyone who behaved as Clinton did.  I know guys like that.  Bones get broken.  But Clinton waited until he was the governor of Arkansas to unleash his inner predator and was thus assured of state trooper protection from any retaliation.  As I've said before.  He's a punk.

A punk embraced, quite recently, with open arms by all the Bushes, 1, 2, and 3.  He's such a great guy, they love hanging out with him.

Until now, contemporary art lovers have been far more attracted to the scandalous controversy caused by artists like Caravaggio and may even prefer the more rebellious artist's dark and tortured paintings.

Yet, the art of Annibale Carracci was far more influential in the course of Baroque art. His style was revolutionary for its unprecedented naturalism and careful, objective study from life. Unlike like-minded contemporary Caravaggio, however, Annibale was able to mix that revolutionary realism with the idealized perfection of classical and Renaissance art, thus pioneering a style of ""idealized realism"" that represented the middle path between the outlandish fantasy of Mannerism and the dark, gritty realism of Caravaggio and his followers.

It's a credit to Carracci that artists such as Poussin, Bernini and Rubens have admired his work and many of his assistant and pupils went on to become renowned artists in their own right, including Giovanni Lanfranco, Domenichino and Guido Reni.

However, although he was adored in the 17th century, Annibale Carracci's reputation suffered the same as the rest of the Baroque: it was smashed in the 18th century with the rise of Neoclassicism.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/953163908097734/?type=3,2016-01-09 08:59:01,16,2,1,16,0,0,0,0,0

William Holman Hunt OM (2 April 1827 – 7 September 1910) was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism. These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs. For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact. Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career. He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/952719638142161/?type=3,2016-01-08 12:06:51,16,1,1,16,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_951207764960015,"THIS IS WHY TRUMP IS WINNING:

Peggy Noonan wrote about Trump this weekend in her Wall Street Journal Column. 

Trump - Things You Might Not Know About Him

  Trump, hopefully, is waking some of the RINOs up.  The criticisms of Trump are amazingly missing something. They are lacking in negative stories from those who work for him or have had business dealings with him.  After all the employees he's had and all the business deals he's made there is a void of criticism. In fact, long term employees call him a strong and merciful leader and say he is far more righteous and of high integrity than people may think.  And while it may surprise many, he's actually humble when it comes to his generosity and kindness.  A good example is a story that tells of his limo breaking down on a deserted highway outside of New York City.  A middle-aged couple stopped to help him and as a thank you he paid off their mortgage, but he didn't brag about that.  Generous and good people rarely talk of charity they bestow on others.But as much as all this is interesting, the real thing that people want to know is what Donald Trump's plan is for America. It's funny how so many people say they don't know what it is, or they act like Trump is hiding it. The information is readily available if people would just do a little homework.  But, since most Americans won't.  

1.) Trump believes that America should not intervene militarily in other country's problems without being compensated for doing so.  If America is going to risk the lives of our soldiers and incur the expense of going to war, then the nations we help must be willing to pay for our help.  Using the Iraq War as an example, he cites the huge monetary expense to American taxpayers (over $1.5 trillion, and possibly much more depending on what sources are used to determine the cost) in addition to the cost in human life.  He suggests that Iraq should have been required to give us enough of their oil to pay for the expenses we incurred. He includes in those expenses the medical costs for our military and $5 million for each family that lost a loved one in the war and $2 million for each family of soldiers who received severe injuries.  

2.) Trump wants America to have a strong military again.  He believes the single most important function of the federal government is national defense.  He has said he wants to find the General Patton or General MacArthur that could lead our military buildup back to the strength it needs to be. While he hasn't said it directly that I know of, Trump's attitude about America and about winning tells me he'd most likely be quick to eliminate rules of engagement that handicap our military in battle.  Clearly Trump is a ""win at all costs"" kind of guy, and I'm sure that would apply to our national defense and security, too  

3.) Trump wants a strong foreign policy and believes that it must include 7 core principles  American interests come first.  Always.  No apologies. Maximum firepower and military preparedness. Only go to war to win. Stay loyal to your friends and suspicious of your enemies.Keep the technological sword razor sharp. See the unseen Prepare for threats before they materialize. Respect and support our present and past warriors. 

4.) Trump believes that terrorists who are captured should be treated as military combatants, not as criminals like the Obama administration treats them. 

5.) Trump makes the point that China's manipulation of their currency has given them unfair advantage in our trade dealings with them.  He says we must tax their imports to offset their currency manipulation, which will cause American companies to be competitive again and drive manufacturing back to America and create jobs here. Although he sees China as the biggest offender, he believes that America should protect itself from all foreign efforts to take our jobs and manufacturing.  For example, Ford is building a plant in Mexico and Trump suggests that every part or vehicle Ford makes in Mexico be taxed 35% if they want to bring it into the U. S., which would cause companies like Ford to no longer be competitive using their Mexican operations and move manufacturing back to the U.S., once again creating jobs here.  

6.) Trump wants passage of NOPEC legislation (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act – NOPEC – S.394), which would allow the government to sue OPEC for violating antitrust laws.  According to Trump, that would break up the cartel. He also wants to unleash our energy companies to drill domestically (sound like Sarah Palin's drill baby, drill?) thereby increasing domestic production creating jobs and driving domestic costs of oil and gas down while reducing dependence on foreign oil. 

7.) Trump believes a secure border is critical for both security and prosperity in America.  He wants to build a wall to stop illegals from entering and put controls on immigration. (And he says he'll get Mexico to pay for the wall, which many have scoffed at, but given his business successes I wouldn't put it past him.)  He also wants to enforce our immigration laws and provide no path to citizenship for illegals.  

8.) Trump wants a radical change to the tax system to not only make it better for average Americans, but also to encourage businesses to stay here and foreign businesses to move here. The resulting influx of money to our nation would do wonders for our economy.  He wants to make America the place to do business.  He also wants to lower the death tax and the taxes on capital gains and dividends. This would put more than $1.6 trillion back into the economy and help rebuild the 1.5 million jobs we've lost to the current tax system.  He also wants to charge companies who outsource jobs overseas a 20% tax, but for those willing to move jobs back to America they would not be taxed. And for citizens he has a tax plan that would allow Americans to keep more of what they earn and spark economic growth.  He wants to change the personal income tax to: Up to $30,000 taxed at 1%. From $30,000 to $100,000 taxed at 5%. From $100,000 to $1,000,000 taxed at 10%. $1,000,000 and above taxed at 15%. 

9.) Trump wants Obamacare repealed. He says it's a ""job-killing, health care-destroying monstrosity"" that ""can't be reformed, salvaged, or fixed.""  He believes in allowing real competition in the health insurance marketplace to allow competition to drive prices down.  He also believes in tort reform to get rid of defensive medicine and lower costs.  

10.) Trump wants spending reforms in Washington, acknowledging that America spends far more than it receives in revenue.  He has said he believes that if we don't stop increasing the national debt once it hits $24 trillion it will be impossible to save this country.  

11.) Even though he says we need to cut spending, he does not want to harm those on Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. He believes that the citizens have faithfully paid in to the system to have these services available and that the American government has an obligation to fulfill its end of the bargain and provide those benefits. Therefore, he wants to build the economy up so that we have the revenue to pay those costs without cutting the benefits to the recipients.  He disagrees with Democrats who think raising taxes is the answer and says that when you do that you stifle the economy.  On the other hand, when you lower taxes and create an environment to help businesses they will grow, hire more workers, and those new workers will be paying taxes that become more tax revenue for the government.  

12.) Trump also wants reform of the welfare state saying that America needs ""a safety net, not a hammock."" He believes in a welfare to work program that would help reduce the welfare roles and encourage people to get back to work.  And he wants a crackdown on entitlement fraud.  

13.) Trump believes climate change is a hoax.  

14.) Trump opposes Common Core.  

15.) Trump is pro-life, although he allows for an exception due to rape, incest, or the life of the mother.  

16.) Trump is pro 2nd Amendment rights.  

17.) Trump's view on same-sex marriage is that marriage is between a man and a woman, but he also believes that this is a states rights issue, not a federal issue.  

18.) Trump supports the death penalty.  Trump believes that there is a lack of common sense, innovative thinking in Washington (Hmmm... looks like he believes in horse sense!).  He says it's about seeing the unseen and that's the kind of thinking we need to turn this country around.  He tells a personal story to illustrate the point: ""When I opened Trump National Golf Club at Rancho Palos Verdes in Los Angeles, I was immediately told that I would need to build a new and costly ballroom. The current ballroom was gorgeous, but it only sat 200 people and we were losing business because people needed a larger space for their events.  Building a new ballroom would take years to get approval and permits (since it's on the Pacific Ocean), and cost about $5 million.  I took one look at the ballroom and saw immediately what needed to be done.  The problem wasn't the size of the room, it was the size of the chairs. They were huge, heavy, and unwieldy.  We didn't need a bigger ballroom, we needed smaller chairs!  So I had them replaced with high-end, smaller chairs. I then had our people sell the old chairs and got more money for them than the cost of the new chairs. In the end, the ballroom went from seating 200 people to seating 320 people.  Our visitors got the space they desired, and I spared everyone the hassle of years of construction and $5 million of expense.  It's amazing what you can accomplish with a little common sense.  On top of his saving years of construction and $5 million in expenses, he also was able to keep the ballroom open for business during the time it would have been under remodeling, which allowed him to continue to make money on the space instead of losing that revenue during construction time. 

19. Donald Trump's entire life has been made up of success and winning.  He's been accused of bankruptcies, but that's not true.  He's never filed personal bankruptcy.  He's bought companies and legally used bankruptcy laws to restructure their debt, just as businesses do all the time.  But he's never been bankrupt personally.

20. He's a fighter that clearly loves America and would fight for our nation.  Earlier I quoted Trump saying, ""I love America.  And when you love something, you protect it passionately – fiercely, even.""   We never hear that from Democrats or even from most Republicans.  Donald Trump is saying things that desperately need to be said but no other candidate has shown the fortitude to stand up and say them.  Looking over this list of what he wants for America I see a very necessary set of goals that are long past due. 

Before we criticize someone because the media does, maybe we should seriously consider what he has to offer, as it is important to know what each of our candidates to replace a President who has ruined us globally, and who has put us on a path to disaster!   This is not an appeal to vote for Trump, only to give some depth of comparison, before this week's debate.

If Obama could win for himself and his successor broader power to regulate the sale of firearms for the executive alone he will have struck a small, but very significant blow in his bid for large-scale gun control. Obama ultimately wants the right to regulate firearms the same way he can regulate the environment, banks and food, and this could be the start.

The path to the kinds of confiscations that Obama has said might be necessary could run through a loophole just like this.

02 January 2016, 06:36 | Jaime Mckinney

 
During a debate earlier this month, Bush called chaos candidate and said ""he'd be a chaos president"". The feedback come as Bush continues his full assault on Trump over the past several weeks questioning each one little thing from his rival's seriousness to intellectual prowess.
Asked about the effect of Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States on Republican primary voters, Bush replied, ""In a month from now, voters won't agree with him"".
For a look at the foreign policy flashpoints that are likely to drive the conversation in 2016, from ISIS to the Iranian Nuclear deal and beyond, we'll turn to two experts - former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell, a senior CBS News security contributor, and Tom Donilon, a former National security Advisor under President Obama.

Bush has taken swipes at Trump in the past. That balancing act is emblematic of the dilemma facing the Republican pack of a dozen current candidates who have chased the real estate magnate for months.

Potential supporters said they don't understand why Bush isn't resonating with Republican voters.

""You guys are the violin and he's the violinist, and he's just playing you like nobody's business"", he said.

Jeb Bush's campaign is shifting gears in an effort to ramp up its ground game ahead of the first primary votes being case.
Although Cruz, Rubio, Bush, and Christie have been pegged as presidential heavyweights in key states, Trump carries more than a third of the conservative electorate.

Such divisions have allowed candidates like Mr. Trump to soar in the polls, he said, but allowing candidates like the bombastic businessman to be the front-runner and face of the party would doom a party that needs to ""realize our demography as a nation is changing"".

The hopeful GOP presidential candidate even shared a clip of his advice on Facebook, joking he gave a ""master class"" on selfie taking.

Trump had re-tweeted a doctored picture of Bush appearing to pick his nose, after which Bush's national press secretary, Kristy Campbell, weighed in, tweeting: ""Out on Twitter there arose such a clatter, late night twitter-drunk Donald is back at it!""
The uptick in spending comes as Trump finds himself neck-and-neck in the polls with Texas Sen. ""The caliphate was a - it happened at warp speed, and the withdrawal of America precipitated it. It wasn't that we created it, but we precipitated it"".
""Jeb Bush has spent $59-million & [is] done"", he added, referring to the former Florida governor whom many pundits expected to be the dynastic front-runner. ""People are legitimately angry with Washington, D.C. And yes, Mr. President, they're legitimately angry with you"". 'I want my damn Selfie. ""It's a strategy to maintain this divisive kind of culture we're in right now"". It seems to be a fascination.

By Daymond Steer

CONWAY — Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, at an editorial board meeting Tuesday, sparred with a conservative columnist over Benghazi and spoke about how she'd address opioid addiction. 

The former first lady, secretary of state and senator from New York is running neck-and-neck with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire Democratic primary polls. A third challenger, Martin O'Malley, is a distant third. The primary is Feb. 9.

Clinton took New Hampshire in 2008 and was the first woman to win a major party's presidential primary, but ultimately the nomination went to Barack Obama.

Before getting into the details of her foreign policy, Clinton, 68, who met with Sun staff for over an hour, took a swipe at Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, who leads the polls on the GOP side.

""Right now, particularly in the Republican primary, they are being given a catharsis, which is fine,"" said Clinton. ""But if that's all you do, then it's really going to eat away at the body politic.""

Clinton also alluded to recent news that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, is starting to campaign for her. ""My husband has  a knack for explaining complicated issues in a way that's easy to understand,"" she said, and now that he's wrapped up his foundation work to help her on the stump, ""I'm delighted,"" Clinton said.

""I think it will actually be an antidote to the sound and fury we are experiencing on the other side,"" she added.

Also on the personal front, Clinton talked about being a grandmother to 15-month-old Charlotte (who calls her ""Gumma"") and how she's over the moon at learning that daughter Chelsea is pregnant again.

Conway Daily Sun Publisher Mark Guerringue asked about her vote to support the Iraq War and her actions as secretary of state during the attacks on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 that led to the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, two of which were with the CIA.

""With Iraq I have said numerous times that it was a mistake to give George Bush that authority, and I certainly believe as secretary of state I more than represented the best interest of our country,"" Clinton said. ""There is nobody who is 100 percent right on every foreign policy call, and I think my record is one I'm very proud of.""

As for Benghazi, she said eight or nine independent investigations have taken place. She also said that as a matter of course, the U.S. sends Americans into dangerous situations. ""Reagan sent Marines to Beirut, and we lost hundreds of Marines, and we had our embassy bombed,"" said Clinton. ""It was never made into a political issue.""

""There were a lot of useful recommendations, and I accepted every one of them before I left,"" said Clinton. ""I said 'OK let's fix this.'""

Republicans have tried to politicize the attacks, and Clinton spent 11 hours testifying before Congress about them.

Guerringue also asked about the controversy surrounding an email to her daughter in which she blamed the attack on ""an al-Qaeda-like group,"" while a statement put out by her State Department made it appear that the attack was a spontaneous uprising stemming from a video on the Internet. She chalked up the mixed messages to the ""fog of war"" and likened the situation to a ""40-alarm fire.""

She said ""responsible"" congressional committees have concluded there were no military assets that could have arrived at the mission in time to save American lives. She said the intelligence committee said the CIA and its contractors had an annex relatively close by but they couldn't get there in time to save Stevens. Two CIA and two State Department people died, and she said using their deaths for political purposes ""dishonors them."" She said far more Americans were killed in attacks on diplomatic assaults in Beirut, Tanzania and Kenya.

Sun Columnist Tom McLaughlin said she told an Egyptian diplomat the Benghazi attack was planned and not a protest but that she told family members of the deceased that the attack was the result of a demonstration. He said she then told George Stephanopoulos that she didn't tell the families the attack was a demonstration about a film.

""Somebody is lying,"" said McLaughlin.""Who is it?

Clinton replied, ""Not me, that's all I can tell you.""

At the time, Clinton said, everyone was emotionally distraught. She said some families didn't know their sons were working for the CIA or were in Benghazi. Clinton said the information she had about the attack was from the intelligence community.

""What happened is people were doing the best they could with information that was changing,"" said Clinton. ""The CIA wrote and approved the talking points that were used. It was also true that from Egypt to Tunisia to Pakistan, the video was the primary spark that was sending people into protesting against our facilities. All of this was happening simultaneously.""

Continuing to press, McLaughlin said three family members victims said that Clinton told him that the attack was the result of the video and or that the filmmaker should be arrested.

Clinton replied that other family members believe differently and stressed she had sympathy for all involved. ""I can't recite for you everything that was in a conversation where people were sobbing, where people were distraught, the president and the vice president, we were all making the rounds talking to people, listening to people,"" said Clinton. ""I was in a very difficult position because we have not yet said two of the four dead were CIA ... This was a part of the fog of war.""

In terms of the U.S. involvement in Libya, which helped over throw Libyan dictator Mpammar Gadhafi in 2011, Clinton said the administration received support from Congress, the U.N. Security Council, and European and Arab states to act in a ""supporting roll.""

She said as bad as parts of Libya are now, it's not as bad as Syria. She said President Barack Obama is on the right track in terms of Syria. Aside from special forces, Clinton said she is ""adamantly against"" putting American troops on the ground in Syria. ""That would be a grave error,"" she said. But, she said, special forces is a different story.

On the domestic front, Clinton addressed the heroin epidemic that's gripping New Hampshire and the rest of the nation. She said numerous people on the campaign trail have asked her to address it. Clinton said that children of her friends have died of overdoses. Clinton also seeks to fight Alzheimer's disease if elected president. She unveiled her plan in Portsmouth.

""I really want to be a president who pays attention to what keeps people up at night,"" Clinton said, before leaving to address a crowd of several hundred in Berlin.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/949082501839208/?type=3,2016-01-01 08:48:40,9,10,3,9,0,0,0,0,0

Why didn't Oday Aboushi criticize Saudi Arabia or any of the Gulf Arab States, who refuse to take in any Islamic refugees. How is their actual policy different than Trump's proposed policy?
They are already dominant Muslim and the ""refugees"" are a weapon of domination - logic as an argument is useless in a post-Christian world. 

Unfortunately this is becoming a typical American story, uninformed idiocy is widespread throughout the land. Thoughts of self preservation have been replaced by feel good ism and the denial of the existence of evil.  

Further:

As I was reading the article I was wondering who the Christian and Jewish athletes were who were being recognized for their athletic achievements?

Trump's plans are to prevent the US from going the way of Europe which day by day is surrendering it's culture to Muslim immigrants.

Case in point. No fireworks tonight, New years Eve, in Brussels, Belgium Brussels happens to be the HQ of the European Union [EU] Brussels also happens to have a neighborhood called Molenbeek which is a recognized no-go zone. Apparently the city leaders of Brussels thought it prudent to cancel the fireworks out of fear that their residents on Molenbeek might try to add some additional fireworks of their own.

If the civilised world does not take steps to eradicate jihad and its barbaric muslim practitioners the world will be doomed.

Just another colossal display of ignorance and another reason to ignore players, teams, and sports where the players spout off on things they know nothing about.

Play football  Oday and score points for your team........leave the prognosticating to the prognosticators.

428053320608798_948508795229912,"A Writer's Nostalgic Memories of a New Year's Past.

The final countdown to New Years Eve 1960 had begun. It was a few minutes to midnight and that marvelous World of Tomorrow was nearly here. While my parents New Years Eve party was in full swing, I was down for the count.

Earlier in the evening I had retreated from the boisterous party into the quiet seclusion of my parent's bedroom. Stretching out on the cool satiny bed, I hibernated under the heavy pile of coats that had been tossed on my parent's bed earlier by the guests.

Enveloped in a tangle of ranch minks, Persian lamb and camels hair, I faded off to sleep. Although permitted to stay up to midnight to bring in the new year, exhaustion won out over my 4-year-old body.

Despite my best efforts I dozed off.

At 11:45 Dad came in to wake me for the midnight celebration that lay ahead. Out of the darkness, I was gently scooped up out of the warm safety of the furs.
 Groggily, I recognized my father's voice , as he carried me into the future.

The future looked very foggy, as the living room was filled with a haze of blue cigarette smoke.

The once full cigarette urns were empty. The assortment of Ronson silver plated table lighters shaped like small Aladdin's lamps seemed to have been given quite a work out.

Mom was scurrying around emptying overflowing ashtrays with the silent butler, that small, silver, oval flip-top garbage can with a long handle that kept cigarette butts safe from tray to kitchen. First rule of hostessing- never allow more than one lipstick-stained cigarette butt to accumulate in an ash tray.

 All the guests were now dressed in party hats embellished with glitter, and feathers; some cone-shaped cardboard hats, some featuring ruffled crepe paper fringe.

The mood of the party was downright effervescent, as bubbly, sparkling sprightly as the glass of royal -ring-a-ding-ding-crown cola I quietly sipped between mouthfuls of Chex party mix.

Dad's excellent cocktails were getting down to work. These buoyant bouffant beauties were letting their hair down. Mama loved to cha-cha but Papa loved to Mambo.

The executive branch, the congress, and most of the judiciary have no more respect for me as a human being than colonial empires had for the most backward and primitive of their subjects.

Trump has shown an ability to hit back. Our DC establishment knows very well how much average Americans hate and distrust them. When Trump came out last week and actually said that he hated ""some media people"" his poll numbers went up.

He could not muster the fortitude to do so and carry those issues to the public if Obama ""shut down' the government over them. More significantly, the Republicans in the House elected Ryan Speaker, which tells us even more about them than about him. Lastly whatever Ryan did, if the Republican majorities in either the House or the Senate had voted against the budget it would not have passed.)

.Alleged police practices at Homan Square, according to those familiar with the facility who spoke out to the Guardian after its investigation into Chicago police abuse, include:

>Keeping arrestees out of official booking databases.
>Beating by police, resulting in head wounds.
>Shackling for prolonged periods.
>Denying attorneys access to the ""secure"" facility.
>Holding people without legal counsel for between 12 and 24 hours, including people as young as 15.

Knight was a painter in the figurative, realist tradition who embraced English Impressionism. During her long career, Knight was among the most successful and popular painters in Britain. In 1929 she was created a Dame and in 1936 became the first woman elected to the Royal Academy since its foundation in 1768. Her large retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy, in 1965, was another first for a woman. Although Knight was known for painting amidst the world of the theatre and ballet in London, and for being a war artist during the Second World War, she was also greatly interested in, and inspired by, more marginalised communities and individuals including Gypsies and circus performers. Her success in the male-dominated British art establishment paved the way for greater status and recognition for women artists.",The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's cover photo,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428054633942000.98516.428053320608798/947488215331970/?type=3,2015-12-29 10:14:27,16,2,1,16,0,0,0,0,0

The feeble resistance to the left's big government designs mostly comes from moderate Democrats if it comes at all. It is clear that Hanson is mostly attempting to warn fellow Americans about a future that looks like California, rather than preach to his native state which is intent to keep the wheels of history turning in a militantly progressive direction.

428053320608798_936010469813078,"Angela Merkel, TIME Person of the Year.....

I spent a great deal of my younger life in Germany.  It is quite a lovely place.  So far this year Europe's leading economy, Germany,  has registered 964,574 new asylum seekers, more than four times the number that arrived in 2014.Syrians topped the figures, with about one in three applications coming from citizens of the war-torn country, for whom Germany has adopted an open-door policy.

Let me be clear, this amounts to 1 percent of the German population.  If we, would do such a thing, it would be the equivalent of greater than 3.5 million refugees.  

I don't think that the American people would be happy with that.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to welcome Syrian refugees has won her praise but also sparked a backlash, with some senior ministers openly questioning the approach and her usually-high poll ratings slipping several points.  The processing time for both Syrians and citizens of Balkans countries was now particularly short, at around three months.

How are they ""vetting"" them.... if at all?

She stated recently in an interview:

""Our essential values are humanity, neighborly love and the joy of fellowship. We believe in the right of every individual to seek happiness and to live their lives, we believe in respect and tolerance. And we know that our free life is stronger than any terrorism.""

Said the hen to the fox as she invited him into the hen house for dinner. The fox replied, I do too as he licked his lips.

Typical TIME magazine choice.  Other blunders in the past included the choice of Adolf Hitler and the Ayatollah.  Bravo for the   publication with a selection honoring someone who has altered the cultural survival of her own country for the worse by foisting millions of uneducated unemployed people on her countrymen which will result in a burden for every German man woman and child. Reading some of the accounts of medical personnel in German hospitals makes one ill with diseases, foul attitudes, and terrible conditions being brought by those with no intention of assimilating or adding to German culture. 

Congratulations Angela Merkel.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/936010469813078/?type=3,2015-12-09 10:27:27,20,10,19,20,0,0,0,0,0

With this latest move, Trump has forced the rest of the GOP field to take the side of Hillary Clinton and more importantly, Barack Obama.  He has led the GOP to discussing relevant topics instead of reading from focus group ""me too"" moderate positions.  And they all fell for it.  This is a game you learn on the playground....... bring the competition to you.......  They all lined up and one tried to out-dem the other, with fear, with the need to conform........ no-one distinguished him/herself by calling for recognition of the actual act...... Well maybe just one ---- Rand Paul.  Who, by the way, even though his poll numbers are ""nowhere"" he is quite coherent about the Middle East and very, very smart.

""Thinking Outside the Box"" is one of the lessons. Trump uses this principle every few days and allows the rest of the group to clump together in one group .....it makes them indistinguishable one from the other.  In other words, if they all think the same..... who will lead?

NOT ONE in the field took the high bar and went to visit the families of the dead, the first responders or come up with a solution.  Oh, boy.

Redding didn't see its release; he was killed three days later in a plane crash. Redding wrote the first verse of the song, under the abbreviated title 'Dock of the Bay', on a houseboat at Waldo Point in Sausalito, California a short time after his appearance at The Monterey pop festival. Redding's familiar whistling, heard before the song's fade was the singer fooling around, he had intended to return to the studio at a later date to add words in place of the whistling.

Right to Rise has $75 million in the bank, and Murphy's not going to let it go to waste, according to Politico.

According to another source close to Right to Rise, Murphy has been floating another tactical shift to potential supporters, suggesting that he might spend the bulk of the $75 million to carpet bomb Rubio, Cruz, Carson, Christie—everyone but Trump. The thinking: making the race into a binary choice between Bush and Trump might be the only way a majority of primary voters go with Bush.

Oh, the outrage regarding Donald Trump's statements about the events following 9-11.  But i remember the story, vaguely because it was so many years ago, however, the OTHER candidate is full of whoppers regarding that time and ...... no outrage:

Hillary told us:

>Chelsea Clinton was jogging around the World Trade Center on 9/11.  Immensely insensitive to those who actually were affected by this horrific attack, Hillary later admitted that Chelsea was actually safely in her Union Square apartment at the time of the attack.

>She landed under sniper fire in Bosnia.  In true Brian Williams-esque form, to listen to Hillary's account, she was ducking and running in a dramatic M*A*S*H type arrival scene in fear for her life.  In actuality, she and Chelsea can be seen on video walking across the Bosnian tarmac… smiling and greeting well wishers.  But hey, anybody could misremember deadly sniper fire, right?

428053320608798_928164580597667,"As most of you know, I often cite the articles from the New York Times on various issues.  This is a premier newspaper with wonderful journalists for the most part.  The one area that they have the propensity to make up stories and outright lies would be in the political arena.  They are committed to the liberal cause.  When you combine this with the Republican super-pacs that would like a Kasich, Rubio or Bush in the lead, well you get audience plants, leading questions with answers that go ""viral"" and the general ""piling on"".  The sad part is, they might actually ""pull it out"" ---- that is, defeating Trump.

But I have a question..........  How many people will say..... ""Well the tricksters and super pacs won, so I will go out in the rain, snow, sleet and hail to vote for the guys that they approve of""......  I don't know of anyone who will ""bend to the will"" of the puppet master.  In part because most people do not consider themselves as puppets.  

By the way, we should have a database of refugees, Syrian or other wise.  Don't we have databases of the citizens of the USA which is updated every 10 years in the form of a Census?  And, is this database of US citizens accessed by means of a social security number?  In the least, I think that it would be important to keep track of people who do not speak the language and have no knowledge of the culture.  That would go far in assisting them in their new found country and assuaging the fears of the citizens of America.  

After all, there are two parties to this refugee situation, and if the refugees have ""rights"", I think the rights of the citizens of America should also count.  

What do you think?

428053320608798_924753807605411,"1914 The brassiere, invented by Caresse Crosby, is patented.

Born on April 20, 1891 in New Rochelle, New York, she was nicknamed ""Polly"" to distinguish her from her mother.

In 1910, at age 19, Polly was preparing to attend yet another débutante ball one evening. As was customary, she put on a corset stiffened with whalebone and a restrictive, tight corset cover that flattened and jammed her large breasts together into a single mono-bosom.

She wore a dress she had worn on her debut a few weeks previously, a sheer evening gown with a plunging neckline that displayed her ample cleavage. But the corset cover, a ""boxlike armour of whalebone and pink cordage,"" poked out from under gown, and this time she called Marie, her personal maid. She told her, ""Bring me two of my pocket handkerchiefs and some pink ribbon… And bring the needle and thread and some pins."" She fashioned the handkerchiefs and ribbon into a simple bra.

Polly's new undergarment complemented the new fashions of the time. She was mobbed after the dance by other girls who wanted to know how she moved so freely,and when she showed her new garment to friends the next day, they all wanted one. One day, she received a request for one of her contraptions from a stranger, who offered a dollar for her efforts. She knew then that this could become a viable business.

She later sold the brassiere patent to The Warner Brothers Corset Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut for US$1,500 (roughly equivalent to $21,000 in current dollars). Warner manufactured the ""Crosby"" bra for a while, but it was not a popular style and was eventually discontinued.[25] Warner went on to earn more than US$15 million from the bra patent over the next thirty years.
In her later years, she wrote,

I can't say the brassiere will ever take as great a place in history as the steamboat, but I did invent it.

In 1934, she had begun a love affair with black actor-boxer Canada Lee despite the threat of miscegenation laws. They had lunch uptown in Harlem at the then new restaurant Franks where they could maintain their secret relationship. By the 1940s, Lee was a Broadway star and featured in the nationwide run of the play Native Son. But the only restaurant in Washington D.C. where they could eat together was an African restaurant named the Bugazi. Unlike so many of her lovers, he didn't ask for money, even when his nightclub The Chicken Coop had a difficult time. When Crosby's brother Walter expressed his dismay at their relationship during a dinner in the early 1940s, Caresse was offended, and had little contact with Walter over the next 10 years. Crosby and Lee's intimate relationship continued into the mid-1940s and contributed to her world-view. Crosby wrote a never-published play, The Cage, transparently based on their relationship.

She was a ""naughty"" girl until the end when she died on January 26, 1970.

I ran the story regarding the pastor this morning to see how many people actually read and become engaged with this tabloid heading.  Well I guess I found out.  Remember, my Ph.D. has a concentration in psychology.  

I personally have no thought one way or the other about these people.  Sad story, but it has happens over and over again.  I think there are about 17 preachers who have had a spouse hurt or killed over the past 10 years.  Look it up.

The first thing I must note is that a number of respondents to the ""pastor"" story were from Indiana.  Yes, I checked it out.   So I discounted those since they have a vested interest in the outcome of the ""problem"".  Then the trolls trying to get ""everyone"" to ""unlike"" the page or asking me if my ""staff' wrote the piece.  Well, unlike if you want,  but my staff of 10 will still write.  These 10 are my 10 fingers.

Let me remind you all of one thing......  We are in a mess in America.  We have elite college students marching for God only knows what, racial strife,  open borders, culture denigration, slaughter of Christians, the loss of our religious liberty, bogus unemployment rates, the greatest number of people out of the workforce, and the list goes on..... 

But y'all are so wrapped up in whether or not the pastor and his wife were ""madly in love"".

And what are you all concerned about?  Some small town story about a pastor and his wife......  oh by the way..... the husband in most cases is the usual suspect..... and the police will send out bogus signals of innocence to make sure that people are caught off guard.  

Art gets almost no mention, the same with politics, religion, history, literature, drug epidemic, employment news, or even puppy stories.... but tabloid he said - she said and the need to control even a free site THAT CAN ONLY BENEFIT YOU WITH THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS YOUR THOUGHTS AND HAVE SOMEONE ACTUALLY ANSWER YOU.

Sites showing Kim Kardashian's oily behind or posting paranoid ""they are hurting us"" are all over the web.  

This is quite disheartening.... but let me remind you that pushy totalitarian thinking is what the left will do to YOU and they do it better than anyone.

Chest Bumps:

Asked to explain why Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, had bumped pectoral regions with another man — a City Council member, as it turned out — Mr. Bush obliged. The man, he said, ""was a co-chairman for Ted Cruz, and he came up to me and said: 'I've changed my mind after the debate. I'm for you.' ""

""I do that for every convert,"" Mr. Bush said with a laugh, turning to a group of reporters following him. ""Anytime you guys want to try a chest bump, I'm all in.""

Warm kisses:

Bush may have made more than a few fellow Republicans squirm when, asked whether he would back a budget deal that would have $10 in spending cuts for a dollar of new taxes, the former Florida governor said, ""You find me a Democrat for cutting spending $10, and I'll give them a warm kiss.""

428053320608798_923164781097647,"Question:  Angela, why are you ""in the tank"" for Trump and spend time ""smearing"" Carson?

First of all, I am not ""in the tank"" for anyone.  When I go to pages and websites, for about 80 percent of them you will find out what ""in the tank"" means.  And I do mean this on the right and on the left.  Some on the far corners are so profane that they border on paranoia.  ""It's us against them"", ""Everyone hates us so we have to band together"", """"We have a rational excuse for everything so I am going to stick my fingers in my ear and stick out my tongue ... at you"".  And finally, ""they lie"" so we should too!  And then the biggest and best-est liar will be the President!

But let me define for you what a conservative is:  Conservatives believe in personal responsibility, limited government, free markets, individual liberty, traditional American values and a strong national defense. Believe the role of government should be to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals. Conservative policies generally emphasize empowerment of the individual to solve problems.

No place in this definition do you find the need to dedicate yourself to delusional thinking or lying to ""get over"".  Every one of the candidates on the right have been reviewed by this site.  AND I have said time and time again that Ben Carson is a lovely man.  That being said, the stories that he writes in his biography have garnered him much acclaim and praise, and it has paid off financially and politically.  To this end, since he has no political dossier, people are questioning his assertion of ""I never lie"" with scrutiny over his personal story.  

Right now we are experiencing a very ugly racial problem.  I think it is not worse than it has EVER been but it is pretty bad given the advances of this modern era.  It is as though such a broad band of people have been driven to believe that the KKK are riding through the streets ready to burn crosses at every door.  Believe me, this paranoia was necessary for the left to circle the wagons of the minority population, concentrate and garner the vote.  To a great extent it has worked.

So....... into this foray comes Dr. Ben Carson, neurosurgeon, soft spoken, and successful Black guy from the inner city.  And guess what?  He now identifies as a Republican.  He has become that rare Ibis that has flown into our midst.  So we assume that every question he gets regarding everything from his biography to his view of the pyramids as ""offensive"", we rationalize that ""smart"" people know that the pyramids were built by Joseph and used to store grain......  We reason that the Bible records that Joseph was given a chariot to travel through Egypt.Joseph would have lived well into the fourth dynasty if he was Imhotep of the 3rd dynasty and would no doubt have served more than one pharaoh. 

Oh well...... now I am tying myself in knots.   

We engage in delusional thinking every 4 years. in 2008 we thought that Sarah Palin was going to ""save the day"" only to throw her away when it did not work.  In 2012 we ran a patrician politician who was unable to connect to the 47 percent he spoke about.  All the way up to the election night we paid no attention to the fact that the 47% were centered around the population centers with the greatest electoral votes........  We deluded ourselves that we would ""win by a landslide"".  

Now we need to show the world that we ""love"" this guy, we are not prejudiced!  So we don't ask the questions about the pyramids.....  And we feign anger, point fingers and prepare for the final ""blow up"" when the soft dulcet tone will not be able to explain how ""tithing"" will become a tax policy.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/923164781097647/?type=3,2015-11-09 09:45:30,22,7,1,22,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_922989404448518,"Question: What Is the Halo Effect?

Answer:

The halo effect is a type of cognitive bias in which our overall impression of a person influences how we feel and think about his or her character. Essentially, your overall impression of a person (""He is nice!"") impacts your evaluations of that person's specific traits (""He is also smart!"").

One great example of the halo effect in action is our overall impression of celebrities.

Since we perceive them as attractive, successful, and often likeable, we also tend to see them as intelligent, kind, and funny.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/922989404448518/?type=3,2015-11-08 22:45:23,12,1,2,12,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_922152744532184,"Answers to Burning Questions:

1.  Angela, do you get a ""scholarship"" to West Point?  NO.

You apply to West Point by requesting and completing a PreCandidate Questionnaire and by obtaining a nomination, normally from a United States Congressman or a Senator.A candidate file will be started after you return the PreCandidate Questionnaire, preferably in the spring of your junior year of high school.

2.  What about the meeting with Westmoreland and Carson?

""In 1969, those who would have completed the entire process would have received their acceptance letters from the Army Adjutant General,"" said Theresa Brinkerhoff, a spokeswoman for the academy. She said West Point has no records that indicate Carson even began the application process. ""If he chose to pursue (the application process), then we would have records indicating such,"" she said.

 Records produced by the US Army show that General Westmoreland was not in Detroit on May 23rd, 24th, 26th, and 27th, but was in Washington keeping a low profile and conducting meetings along with making a trip to Massachusetts and Vermont.

On May 23rd and 24th, General Westmoreland went to Massachusetts and Vermont. On the night of the 23rd, he had a cocktail with Gen. Hamlett in Montpelier (VT) after having visited Fort Devens (MA) that afternoon. On the day of the 24th, he addressed a convocation at Norwich University before returning to Washington that evening. On Monday the 26th and Tuesday the 27th, he held meetings in Washington, played tennis, and went to a ball conducted by the Washington Association of Military Attaches.

As with most generals, he kept meticulous records.

Several reports of an event in February of that year, similar to the one Carson described. Then, Westmoreland was the featured guest at a 1,500-person banquet to celebrate Medal of Honor recipient Dwight Johnson. The event drew prominent guests, including the governor at the time, the mayor of Detroit, the president of Ford Motor Company and nine previous Medal of Honor awardees, according to an Associated Press account of the event.

Carson, a leader of the city's ROTC program at the time, may have been among the invited guests at the $10-a-plate event.

It is possible that the one personal day he had, Sunday May 26, 1969, he could have flown to Detroit to meet with Ben Carson..... but why?

428053320608798_917899701624155,"Happy Birthday to the GREAT Mahalia Jackson!

Mahalia Jackson (October 26, 1911 – January 27, 1972) was an American gospel singer. Possessing a powerful contralto voice, she was referred to as ""The Queen of Gospel"". She became one of the most influential gospel singers in the world and was heralded internationally as a singer and civil rights activist. She was described by entertainer Harry Belafonte as ""the single most powerful black woman in the United States"". She recorded about 30 albums (mostly for Columbia Records) during her career, and her 45 rpm records included a dozen ""golds""—million-sellers.

""I sing God's music because it makes me feel free"", Jackson once said about her choice of gospel, adding, ""It gives me hope. With the blues, when you finish, you still have the blues.""

Mahalia was an ""over-comer"", she was five when her mother Charity died, leaving her family to decide who would raise Halie and her brother. Aunt Duke assumed this responsibility, and the children were forced to work from sunup to sundown. Aunt Duke would always inspect the house using the ""white glove"" method. If the house was not cleaned properly, Jackson was beaten. If one of the other relatives could not do their chores or clean at their job, Jackson or one of her cousins was expected to perform that particular task. School was hardly an option. Jackson loved to sing and church is where she loved to sing the most. Her Aunt Bell told her one day she would sing in front of royalty, a prediction that would eventually come true. Jackson began her singing career at the local Mount Mariah Baptist Church. She was baptized in the Mississippi River by Mt. Mariah's pastor, the Rev. E.D. Lawrence, then went back to the church to ""receive the right hand of fellowship"".

Jackson played an important role during the civil rights movement. In August 1956, she met Ralph Abernathy and Martin Luther King, Jr. at the National Baptist Convention. A few months later, both King and Abernathy contacted her about coming to Montgomery, Alabama, to sing at a rally to raise money for the bus boycott. They also hoped she would inspire the people who were getting discouraged with the boycott.

Despite death threats, Jackson agreed to sing in Montgomery. Her concert was on December 6, 1956. By then, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in Browder v. Gayle that bus segregation was unconstitutional. In Montgomery, the ruling was not yet put into effect, so the bus boycott continued. At this concert she sang ""I've Heard of a City called Heaven"", ""Move On Up a Little Higher"" and ""Silent Night"". There was a good turnout at the concert and they were happy with the amount of money raised. However, when she returned to the Abernathy's home, it had been bombed. The boycott finally ended on December 21, 1956, when federal injunctions were served, forcing Montgomery to comply with the court ruling.

Although Jackson was internationally known and had moved up to the northern states, she still encountered racial prejudice. One account of this was when she tried to buy a house in Chicago. Everywhere she went, the white owners and real estate agents would turn her away, claiming the house had already been sold or they changed their minds about selling. When she finally found a house, the neighbors were not happy. Shots were fired at her windows and she had to contact the police for protection. White families started moving out and black families started moving in. Everything remained the same in her neighborhood except for the skin color of the residents.  Wiki

Jackson died in Chicago on January 27, 1972 at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park, Illinois, of heart failure and diabetes complications.Two cities paid tribute: Chicago and New Orleans. Beginning in Chicago, outside the Greater Salem Baptist Church, 50,000 people filed silently past her mahogany, glass-topped coffin in final tribute to the queen of gospel song.[27] The next day, as many people who could—6,000 or more—filled every seat and stood along the walls of the city's public concert hall, the Arie Crown Theater of McCormick Place, for a two-hour funeral service. Her pastor, Rev. Leon Jenkins, Mayor Richard J. Daley, and Mrs. Coretta Scott King eulogized her during the Chicago funeral as ""a friend – proud, black and beautiful"".[28] Sammy Davis, Jr., and Ella Fitzgerald paid their respects. Joseph H. Jackson, president of the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc., delivered the eulogy at the Chicago funeral. Aretha Franklin closed the Chicago rites with a moving rendition of ""Precious Lord, Take My Hand"".

Three days later, a thousand miles away, the scene repeated itself: again the long lines, again the silent tribute, again the thousands filling the great hall of the Rivergate Convention Center in downtown New Orleans this time. Mayor Moon Landrieu and Louisiana Governor John J. McKeithen joined gospel singer Bessie Griffin. Dick Gregory praised Jackson's ""moral force"" as the main reason for her success.[29] Lou Rawls sang ""Just a Closer Walk With Thee"". The funeral cortège of 24 limousines drove slowly past her childhood place of worship, Mt. Moriah Baptist Church, where her recordings played through loudspeakers. The procession made its way to Providence Memorial Park in Metairie, Louisiana, where she was entombed.Despite the inscription of her birth year on her gravestone as 1912, she was actually born in 1911. Among her surviving relatives are her great-nephews, NBA basketball player Danny Granger and soul artist Scotty Granger.

Jackson's estate was reported at more than four million dollars. Some reporters estimated record royalties, television and movie residuals, and various investments made it worth more. The bulk of the estate was left to a number of relatives, many of whom cared for her during her early years. Among principal heirs were relatives including her half-brother, John Jackson, and aunt, Hannah Robinson. Neither of her ex-husbands, Isaac Hockenhull (1936–1941) and Sigmund Galloway (1964–1967), were mentioned in her will.

""However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.""

428053320608798_900534716693987,"Katsushika Hokusai

Hokusai's work typified that type of Japanese art which we now call ukiyoe (""pictures of the floating world"") so we, with our incessant need to classify All Things Art, label him as an Ukiyo-e artist.

That is, however, a rather limiting description of Hokusai's art. He also exemplified styles ranging from the Kanō (15th-century secular ink painters) and Sumiyoshi schools, to shunga (erotic pictures), with numerous styles of 18th - 19th century Japanese illustration in between.

Hokusai's childhood name is widely supposed to have been Tokitaro, but hold on. Over the course of his next, just-shy-of-90 years, he went by no fewer than 30 different names including Shunrō, Sōri, Kakō, Tatsumasa, Gakyōjin, Taito, Iichi, and Manji (and those are merely the better-known ones). Word of friendly advice? Modern scholarship sticks with ""Hokusai,"" often without the ""Katsushika.""

Life:

Born to an artisan family, Hokusai was apprenticed to a woodblock engraver at a young age. By the time he was 19, the leading ukiyoe master, Katsukawa Shunshō, had taken him on as a pupil and Hokusai was more-or-less formally introduced to artistic society at age 20. Once he began receiving paying commissions there was no turning back, and he'd parted ways with the Katsukawa school by 1795. Until he died, however, he never ceased learning all he could about art from ukiyoe (and other) masters.

Early on in this quest for knowledge, Hokusai was exposed to Western art and quickly picked up (traditionally non-Japanese) artistic techniques such as one-point perspective. It's hard to describe the tremendous impact this chance encounter had on Art History from there on out. It led Hokusai to an entirely new style of ukiyoe that continues to echo in Japanese art to this day. And, unbeknownst to Hokusai, his new style would travel back to Western art and directly influence its future.

Over the course of his long life, Hokusai continued to operate with a restless, incessant thirst for creation. Though he was frequently (and rather proudly) broke, he never turned down a job, whether it was for a distinguished publisher or a brothel. He changed his residence over 90 times, marketed himself with pure genius, enjoyed fame in his own lifetime and painted until he died at a ripe old age. Conservative estimates mark his total output at an astounding 30,000 pieces.

These days, many people - readers and employed artists, alike - owe him a debt of gratitude for originating manga as an art form. We also often tend to think of him as a (if not the) ""classic"" Japanese artist - a tendency that needs to be re-examined. In his time, Hokusai's art was radically different and very un-Japanese. It's just one of those weird twists of fate that the French Impressionists (and beyond) mistakenly believed Hokusai's original style represented all of Japanese art.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/900534716693987/?type=3,2015-09-14 22:10:01,12,2,2,12,0,0,0,0,0

Inventor (1819–1867)

Inventor Elias Howe patented his plans for the first practical sewing machine in 1846, and successfully sued Isaac Singer for the rights in 1854.

In 1846 Elias Howe patented the first practical sewing machine. It attracted little attention, and he moved to England to perfect it for use with leather and similar materials. When he returned the next year, he found that I. M. Singer was making and selling his sewing machine. Howe finally established his patent rights in 1854, and his invention revolutionized the garment industry.

428053320608798_897508486996610,"Today in 1921
Margaret Gorman, District of Columbia, became the first Miss America!

In the summer of 1921, while getting ready to enter the Junior Class of Western High School, Margaret Gorman's picture was one of approximately one thousand photos entered into a popularity contest held by the Washington Herald. Six remaining finalists were escorted around the city throughout the summer and Margaret Gorman was chosen as the first ""Miss Washington, D. C."" The prize for the winner was a trip to the Second Annual Atlantic City Pageant as an honored guest.

Margaret, along with other ""Inter-City Beauties,"" arrived in Atlantic City and entered a new event: The ""Inter-City Beauty"" Contest. It was judged in stylish afternoon attire by the judges, but and the public alike, who shared in 50 percent of the final score. Undoubtedly personality played a large role in the voting as masses of people surrounded each entrant to get to know her better and throw questions at them throughout the event. Later, the entrants were escorted and presented on the stage of the Keith Theatre on the Garden Pier.

The amateur prize, the Watkins Trophy, was awarded to Margaret Gorman, Miss South Jersey, Kathryn M. Gearon placed second, receiving $100 in gold. A special professional prize, the Endicott Trophy, was awarded to Miss New York, silent film actress Virginia Lee.

An immediate hit with the crowds, the ""Inter-City Beauties"" were later judged head-to-head against two other ""Beauty"" winners in selected classes of the now famous Bather's Revue: an ""amateur winner"" from over two hundred local women and tourists, and a ""professional winner,"" which included a field of eleven professional models and actresses. In this extravagant and much-hyped final event, Margaret Gorman won the Grand Prize: the Golden Mermaid trophy.

After much celebration, it was back to Western High School for Margaret.

Upon her return to Atlantic City the following year, Margaret was expected to defend her positions. However, with the Washington Herald having selected a new ""Miss Washington, D.C.1922,"" Atlantic City Pageant officials didn't know what new title to award Margaret. Since both titles she won in 1921 were a little awkward (""Inter-City Beauty, Amateur"" and ""The Most Beautiful Bathing Girl in America""), it was decided to call her ""Miss America"".

She is the only Miss America to receive a crown at the conclusion of her year.

Margaret did compete in succeeding years unsuccessfully, but she always remained a favorite of Atlantic City crowds. In the mid-twenties, she married Victor Cahill, who was a real estate man. She enjoyed a happy marriage until his passing in 1957. She remained a life-long resident of Washington D.C. but enjoyed traveling as a favorite hobby. Near the end of her life, she said, ""I've lived a charmed life. I've been very lucky. God has been very kind to me."" Leaving behind several nieces and nephews who have fond and loving memories of Margaret, she passed away in early October 1995 at age 90.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/897508486996610/?type=3,2015-09-09 09:09:07,26,2,3,26,0,0,0,0,0

The Lonely Tree (German: Der einsame Baum) is an 1822 oil-on-canvas painting by German painter Caspar David Friedrich. It measures 55 × 71 centimetres (22 × 28 in). The work depicts a panoramic view of a romantic landscape of plains with mountains in the background. A solitary oak tree dominates the foreground.

An ancient oak stands at the centre of the painting, clearly damaged but still standing. The tree's branches, dark in silhouette, project into the largely overcast morning sky. Banks of cloud seem to form a dome above the tree. The crown of the tree is dead, and the top of its trunk and two truncated branches resemble a cross. A shepherd shelters under the leaf-bearing lower branches. His flock of sheep graze beside a pond in the wide grassy meadow around the tree. In the middle distance, villages and a town nestle among other trees and bushes. Tree-clad hills pile up into blue-grey mountains in the background.

It's offensive to hear Jeb Bush call himself, and by extension his amnesty policies, ""conservative.""  Legalizing illegal aliens has nothing to do with limited government and individual freedom.  We lose our individual freedoms when illegals rape and kill our citizens, when they take our tax dollars for ""social"" services, and when Spanish becomes the primary language in our kindergartens.  Limited government is about attending to the security of the nation, but Jeb Bush twists it like a punch line in a joke.

This completely sidesteps the plain, obvious and galling fact that we are not deporting those illegal immigrants who are arrested by the police for violating other laws — and are then turned loose back into American society.

""The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins."" 
- attributed to Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. 

In other words, ONE GROUP HAS NO RIGHT TO INFRINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF ANY OTHER GROUP.

 I am very weary of the few black people who use their color to intimidate people.  These women were not escorted off because they were black.  They were being disrespectful of the other people on the train and, rightly, were asked to leave when they refused to show some respect and abide by the ""rules"" of respect.  They were asked more than once to bring their boisterous talk and laughter down.  More than once.  That does not sound like they were targeted because of their color, but because of their brazen refusal to do as asked.

Fallout

August 2, 2015

April 30th, 1997, was the night the episode aired when Ellen came out in front of America. June 28th, 2015, the Supreme Court legalized same sex marriage. Eighteen years, one month and 29 days. That's how long it took the fallout I expected after watching the episode to arrive.

Since the Supreme Court's decision I have been in a bit of a daze I suppose. In a matter of hours I watched as FB became a rainbow parade before my eyes, and watched people I know declare how happy they were people were finally getting what they deserved. I had an over whelming desire to grab each one by both ears and say ""But what about the kids?! Did you ever stop to think about the kids?! What about what they deserve?!"" I didn't waste my time though because most people can't seem to see through the garbage propaganda they've been fed by the media and entertainment.

Admittedly, a lot of people on my FB have no idea my mom is gay. Let alone how I feel about it. And because I'm still trying to protect my mom and my family, I have hesitated saying much at all about my stance there. The one time I did share an anti-gay marriage article, I received a very hostile personal message from a family member accusing me of being disrespectful, and a holy roller. While I have religious beliefs, my position on this stems from my personal experience first, and my religious beliefs second. I don't have to use religion to defend why I think gay marriage and gay parenting is wrong, and to date, I haven't.

That family member ended up unfriending me shortly thereafter, which is fine I suppose.

Another family member, on the other hand, was scrolling through her feed one day and came across a familiar face. It was a link to an interview I had done with CBN. She was very supportive of what I had said in the interview, which was a huge relief.

Coming out and speaking about this has not been a cake walk. I have been called horrible names, ridiculed, and stressed out at times beyond anything I had previously experienced. I have put relationships that I cherish on the line and risk losing so much. But at the same time I know that kids like myself have to do this because no one else can, and in some ways, few others will. I have come to better understand how the system works and why it so imperative that we stand up for what's right. Children do not deserve what is being done to them and as a society we will have to answer for the atrocities being committed as I type. More and more are coming forward, even if not as publicly as myself and the others, but they are trying to speak up as best they can. We are the greatest threat to the gay community, and they are well aware. They admit as much by attacking us with such fervor and heat so publicly.

One of the things I have observed since the SCOTUS ruling is the attitude of many people that supported ssm becoming less. . .supportive. See, the thing is so many people thought that giving in and letting gays have ssm would shut them up and they would go away. Like a little child nags you for something until you finally give in, hoping to just stop the noise. But it didn't work that way in this case. Nope. Once they got it all you saw were articles about where the gay agenda was going next, and how throuples and polyamorous couples want marriage, and now of course all of the trans junk. By the way, I find being referred to as cisgendered very offensive. What the crap people? We're straight. Not cisgendered. There was already a term for us. One had to be created for them.

Once people saw that the gay machine was rolling full steam ahead they felt tricked, beguiled. And the polls show it. The support for ssm is down, but what does it really matter? Too little, too late. My only hope is that people wake up enough to realize that giving them marriage does not mean that we must give them children. For crying out loud, people need to realize what a train wreck this is going to be.

In closing I would just like to say that I've been extremely overwhelmed by the support and words of encouragement I have received from readers. I never imagined my little ol' blog would make it to people all around the world. It's humbling to say the very least. I would love to do a Q&A with any of you that might be interested. What would you like to know about me, the way I was raised, etc? Please leave questions in the comments and I'll throw together a post with answers to the questions I get.

Thank you for reading. Thank you for sharing if you feel so inclined. But most of all, please get involved in the fray in some form or fashion. This is about all of us, and sooner or later this subject is going to touch your life if it hasn't already.

Goodnight from Podunk, Oklahoma, USA

The Chamber of Commerce crowd is so convinced that Jeb is the man that it (so far) has placed a more than $100 million bet on that proposition.

He was delighted to know that he lives in a home built by the Trump clan...... AND  was delighted to learn of his Trump connection. The closest he had come to a Trump affiliation before this, he said, was doing some electrical work at Trump Village, Fred Trump's middle-income housing development in Coney Island, Brooklyn.

It was ""just awesome,"" he said of his link to his preferred presidential candidate, ""a very smart man"" who ""knows business and knows how to run things.""

Ohio Gov. John Kasich was not invited due to his decision to expand Medicaid. Also not invited or opting not to attend were U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, former Virginia Gov.

Al  Qaeda, Arabic for ""the base,"" is an international terrorist network.   Its main goal is to rid Muslim countries of what it sees as the direct influence of the West, and replace it with fundamentalist Islamic regimes. Attacking outside of Muslim countries in acts of violence is directed by high-ranking members of that extremist group.  Unlike what we believe to be true, there is no ""supreme leader"", president nor central ""king-pin"", when one ""leader"" is killed, another takes his place ---- a temporary position at best.

Here are some excerpts from their manual or a small section from an al Qaeda handbook recovered by police from a terrorist's home in Manchester, England.

In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. The main mission for which the military organization is responsible is the overthrow of the godless regimes and their replacement with Islamic regimes. Other missions consist of the following:

>Gathering information about the enemy, the land, the installations, and the neighbors.

>Kidnapping enemy personnel, documents, secrets, and arms.

>Assassinating enemy personnel as well as foreign tourists.

>Freeing the brothers who are captured by the enemy.

>Spreading rumors and writing statements that instigate people against the enemy.

>Blasting and destroying the places of amusement, immorality, and sin.

>Blasting and destroying the embassies and attacking vital economic centers.

>Blasting and destroying bridges leading into and out of the cities.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/883559455058180/?type=3,2015-08-12 04:52:32,14,2,3,14,0,0,0,0,0

On the way, the violent mob put four cars on fire and stubbed to death two dogs that belonged to their 'enemies.'

428053320608798_879422895471836,"Good Wednesday Morning!

In Cold Blood......

Twenty Nine year old Bryant Brewer of Chicago surprised the 43-year-old Officer Soderberg .  Soderberg  was approached by Bryant Brewer, 24, and a physical altercation ensued.  During the struggle, Brewer was able to disarm and fatally shoot Officer Soderberg.  Then, Brewer stole his gun and left the officer to die.  Moments later, Brewer opened fire in what appears to have been an attempted-armed robbery of a civilian.  Officers heard the gunshots and ran out of the building where they discovered Brewer and exchanged gunfire with him.  Brewer was wounded, but recovered.  Officer Thor Soderberg died at the scene.

According to the latest victimization paradigm, Officer Soderberg was probably brutalizing Black men in his spare time both on the job and off......  Right?  Well, no......On July 7, 2010 (the day of his death), Officer Soderberg participated in a weeklong police operation called Operation Protect Youth.  The program was taking place in the Target Response Unit's facility located at 6120 S. Racine Ave — former Englewood District Station.  At approximately 3:45 p.m., Officer Soderberg, a US Army veteran, finished his shift and proceeded to walk to his vehicle in the deployment's parking lot, that was when he met Bryant Brewer.
He was attacked and murdered in cold blood.

Thor Soderberg was honored by the addition of his star to the Police Superintendent's Honored Star Case at the Chicago Police Headquarters.

 His is the 479th Honored Star. 

What about Brewer?  Well........Neither side disputes that Brewer shot Soderberg three times before firing at several other officers and one civilian outside a police deployment center in the Englewood neighborhood.  You see it takes three bullet holes in the body of a policeman for it to be undisputed that the criminal fired at least three times.....

The fact that Brewer (the killer) was inattentive, spoke in gibberish, and appeared disoriented and sometimes hostile during four interviews with him, was cause to make sure that he was not insane or at least mentally impaired......  this task took the work of several psychiatrists, tests and the like conducted over the past several years or so....  I guess we always need to find out the motives of killers, especially when they pump bullets into a policeman..... you see, the killer might be suffering from a bad childhood, maybe his parents did not read to him from the Berenstain Bears collection, maybe he did not get the toy he wanted for Christmas when he was 6 or maybe he was mad about White Supremacy.... 

Mr. Brewer was given quite attentive care by two well thought of psychiatrists and a very sensitive defense lawyer.  He was even thought to be schizophrenic, they pondered his motives......  could it have been the Heineken beer that the Officer Soderberg  was anticipating having ......  it was apparently in his car .... perhaps for future consumption in front of the television later....?  

Geeze, what could it be?  Maybe Mr. Brewer got scared after shooting one shot and then his trigger finger was shaking so hard that the gun ""went off"" two more times!!!!!!!!  

Or just maybe ""Mr. Brewer"" is a common liar, street thug and general killer who knew how to play the system of bleeding heart, compassionate Caucasians who are afraid of being called ""names"".  Perhaps they overlooked the testimony of Brewer's former housemate Vernon Brown, who testified Brewer talked several times about how much he hated police and wanted to kill them.  Maybe he was just a violent, evil person who would have killed both psychiatrists if he had access to THEIR weapon.  

He was smirking when, after hours of awaiting a verdict, the judge came back convicting Brewer of one count of attempted first-degree murder, one count of armed robbery and one count of murder in the first degree.  Sentencing next month.

It only took 6 years.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/879422895471836/?type=3,2015-08-05 06:39:29,40,9,44,40,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_879228162157976,"Today in History:  1944 Anne Frank was  captured

Acting on tip from a Dutch informer, the Nazi Gestapo captures 15-year-old Jewish diarist Anne Frank and her family in a sealed-off area of an Amsterdam warehouse. The Franks had taken shelter there in 1942 out of fear of deportation to a Nazi concentration camp. They occupied the small space with another Jewish family and a single Jewish man, and were aided by Christian friends, who brought them food and supplies. Anne spent much of her time in the ""secret annex"" working on her diary. The diary survived the war, overlooked by the Gestapo that discovered the hiding place, but Anne and nearly all of the others perished in the Nazi death camps.

Annelies Marie Frank was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, on June 12, 1929. She was the second daughter of Otto Frank and Edith Frank-Hollander, both of Jewish families that had lived in Germany for centuries. With the rise of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in 1933, Otto moved his family to Amsterdam to escape the escalating Nazi persecution of Jews. In Holland, he ran a successful spice and jam business. Anne attended a Montessori school with other middle-class Dutch children, but with the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940 she was forced to transfer to a Jewish school. In 1942, Otto began arranging a hiding place in an annex of his warehouse on the Prinsengracht Canal in Amsterdam.

On her 13th birthday in 1942, Anne began a diary relating her everyday experiences, her relationship with her family and friends, and observations about the increasingly dangerous world around her. Less than a month later, Anne's older sister, Margot, received a call-up notice to report to a Nazi ""work camp."" Fearing deportation to a Nazi concentration camp, the Frank family took shelter in the secret annex the next day. One week later, they were joined by Otto Frank's business partner and his family. In November, a Jewish dentist—the eighth occupant of the hiding place—joined the group.

For two years, Anne kept a diary about her life in hiding that is marked with poignancy, humor, and insight. The entrance to the secret annex was hidden by a hinged bookcase, and former employees of Otto and other Dutch friends delivered them food and supplies procured at high risk. Anne and the others lived in rooms with blacked-out windows, and never flushed the toilet during the day out of fear that their presence would be detected. In June 1944, Anne's spirits were raised by the Allied landing at Normandy, and she was hopeful that the long-awaited liberation of Holland would soon begin.

On August 1, 1944, Anne made her last entry in her diary. Three days later, 25 months of seclusion ended with the arrival of the Nazi Gestapo. Anne and the others had been given away by an unknown informer, and they were arrested along with two of the Christians who had helped shelter them. They were sent to a concentration camp in Holland, and in September Anne and most of the others were shipped to the Auschwitz death camp in Poland. In the fall of 1944, with the Soviet liberation of Poland underway, Anne was moved with her sister Margot to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. Suffering under the deplorable conditions of the camp, the two sisters caught typhus and died in early March 1945. The camp was liberated by the British less than two months later.

Otto Frank was the only one of the 10 to survive the Nazi death camps. After the war, he returned to Amsterdam via Russia, and was reunited with Miep Gies, one of his former employees who had helped shelter him. She handed him Anne's diary, which she had found undisturbed after the Nazi raid. In 1947, Anne's diary was published by Otto in its original Dutch as Diary of a Young Girl. An instant best-seller and eventually translated into more than 50 languages, The Diary of Anne Frank has served as a literary testament to the nearly six million Jews, including Anne herself, who were silenced in the Holocaust.

The Frank family's hideaway at Prinsengracht 263 in Amsterdam opened as a museum in 1960. A new English translation of Anne's diary in 1995 restored material that had been edited out of the original version, making the work nearly a third longer.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/879228162157976/?type=3,2015-08-04 19:57:25,107,5,40,107,0,0,0,0,0

The Videos, Planned Parenthood and the Myth of 3%

Many have been riveted by the revelations by videos – now 5, regarding Planned Parenthood and the reported ""harvesting"" of human organs. Money changes hands in this level of commerce but there is currently a dispute as to whether or not the organs (livers, and such) are actually sold for profit (presumably it is illegal to profiteer in human body parts) or as ""reimbursement"" for ""expenses"".

The ""reimbursement"" paradigm is more palatable for some people than than the possibility of doctors without conscience making plans for the new wing on their home, family travel or perhaps a Lamborghini. The ""reimbursement"" paradigm also provides us the necessary cover for feelings of guilt, (for whatever reason) or the comforting knowledge that should the ""problem"" of an unwanted pregnancy arise , we have the ""problem"" covered without the pesky feeling that a part of us could be coldly spliced, diced and sold as spare parts for any reason. ""Reimbursement"" implies a ""helping hand"" while ""profit"" an be thought of as something else…. something colder and less humane.

Essentially, Planned Parenthood,is currently embroiled in a scandal over secret videos capturing its dismemberment of unborn babies and sale of their body parts. In addition, although there has been much objection as to the practice of having the prospective mother view an ultrasound of her baby prior to making the decision to abort, no such though is given by the doctors using the ultrasound procedure to make sure that they preserve and not crush those parts of the child that they need for a particular order.

Callously, one doctor after another discusses in casual talk, or over a glass of wine and a bowl of delectable salad greens, the procedure for procuring bits and pieces of organs, the profitability of each organ and how not to make them ""crunchy"" —- as though they were speaking of frying potato chips. But I have a few questions for this group of modern day body merchants:

1> Planned Parenthood claims that abortions are only 3 percent of what they provide. If the practice of abortion is only 3 percent of what they do, then could they just not get by on the other 97 percent of their business? Or is there something that I am missing in this equation?

Further, is the abortion counted as an abortion by this organization or as just another one of the services that are offered? For example, say you have the abortion, but first another pregnancy test is performed, then afterward you are checked for an STD or two (say two), then you are prescribed medication, and perhaps you obtain two lab tests. Guess what, the abortion only counts for 20 percent or 1/5 of the procedures that you went in for….

From Oct. 1, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2013, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions out of 1,058,490 performed in total for that period. That is roughly 30%. Planned Parenthood performs approximately 30 percent of all abortions in the United States per year.

2>I watched as Elizabeth Warren, the Superwoman of the left and reportedly of Native Americans, argue that the videos are ""fraudulent"". I have not been able to understand how one can inveigle a doctor to speak about the profit of ""baby livers"" and making sure that something is not ""crunchy"". Is she suggesting that the video technicians used robots or synthesizing machines to change the words in these people's mouths? Or is she appealing to those people who will stick their fingers in their ears, shut their eyes and scream until given direction, no matter how nonsensical or improbable from someone who will soothe their mind but never and momentarily numb their soul to such barbaric practices not seen outside of a horror film or reports of the experiments of Josef Mengele. No, Warren's argument was about as thin as her claim that she is a Cherokee Indian tribe member.

3>What does it take to get doctors to the level of callousness about human life that they readily sell the remains of otherwise healthy humans? I watch younger women with the knowledge that technology did not create the ghoulish words and phrases that emanated from the mouths of politicians twist and turn to justify the trafficking of human body parts and I marvel that the human condition has not changed a bit. There is truly nothing new under the sun……..

When I hear the justification that selling human beings is the right thing to do because they are helping the human race with research etc…… I recall that every evil was justified at one time in our history as a necessary ""right"". For example, slavery , Jim Crow, misogyny, female gentile mutilation and just about any practice of brutality or evil can be explained away, rationalized and justified as right for humanity because of the god given quality of man's intellect to reason and justify.

What we have become accustomed to in America is the ability to follow, to act – out, curse people out, give the middle finger and take pills or other things  to dull the banality of their existence……But what is now becoming increasingly rare is the ability to THINK. We cry for ""leaders"" but we destroy them because we are unable to lead ourselves on our small level and because they encourage us to think of greater things. We no longer believe or read Sacred text because it makes us painfully aware of our shortcomings because it causes us to reflect or think about them.  Thinking might just make us aware of right and wrong ,which for some is quite painful.

So try to think about this, if the destruction of a small helpless and perfect life — because by definition a baby has no sin, becomes an ordinary and normal way of doing things in our lives, how soon will it be that we deem certain individuals not worthy for anything more than the donation of vital organs. How soon til we callously euthanize the sick or elderly because they ""have no value"" or they have something of value that we want – maybe he has a great eye, or a healthy kidney or liver……. who cares if he is 26…?

If man can think it, he will do it. Dehumanization is just a thought away. And guess what? Since I started this story…….. 7378 babies have been slaughtered providing untold amounts of livers for the doctors at Planned Parenthood.  How's that for 3 percent?

Officer Ray Tensing, of the University of Cincinnati police department, shot and killed 43-year-old Sam Dubose during a routine traffic stop July 19 near campus.

A body camera video that the police played for reporters showed Officer Tensing stopped Samuel Dubose for a missing front license plate. Dubose failed to provide a driver's license as Tensing requested then tried to prevent Tensing, who told Dubose to take his seat belt off, from opening the car door.

The car started slowly rolling forward as Tensing reached in and yelled for him to stop. The officer then pulled his gun and fired once, killing Dubose.

The police chief said Officer Tensing was not dragged by the car, as the officer had reported, but instead he fell backwards after shooting Dubose in the head.

Tensing, 25, was fired by the University of Cincinnati after his arrest. He worked there for four years and was also a graduate of the university.

Dubose was engaged to be married this week , was a  43-year old music producer and artist, was the father of 13 children.

The Business of Trafficking in Human Body Parts.

As we mourn the loss of Cecil the lion, something is being missed......  StemExpress, the company which makes its money trafficking bits and pieces , organs and tissue of aborted infants obtained a court order blocking the release of footage.showing their peddlers hawking their goods ---- livers, kidneys and other organs in demand.

Employees at StemExpress, a for-profit company, tried to maximize the financial benefit of each fetus by obtaining the most profitable organs.  As one such ""salesperson"" barked """"The harder and more valuable the tissue, the more money you get,"" Ms. O'Donnell said. ""So if you can somehow procure a brain or a heart, you're going to get more money than just chorionic villi or umbilical cord. That's basically what it is. So I guess that's an incentive to try and get the hard stuff.""

Just not the crunchy stuff, that was eaten by one of the doctors.... or however she found out about the crunchiness.

As one of the former employees stated:  ""It's basically a huge trafficking of fetal tissues,"" Holly O'Donnell, the ex-employee, explained. ""StemExpress is a company that hires procurement techs to draw blood and dissect dead fetuses and sell the parts to researchers.""

428053320608798_876420832438709,"Hunting:

Some people will look at the picture today and assume that I am against hunting.  Not true.  By definition, hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal, or pursuing it with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, or trade. In present-day use, lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as game and are usually mammals and birds.

Hunting can also be utilized for modern wildlife management, for example, to help maintain a population of healthy animals within an environment's ecological carrying capacity when natural checks such as predators are absent.

As for game consumption, I have tried it and I respect those who enjoy it but unfortunately for me, I suppose, my palate is not sufficiently sophisticated enough to enjoy it. In fact, I really don't even like poultry, except for the occasional turkey at holidays.  I do, however, certainly respect those who enjoy game meat.  

 Fishing, which is not commonly categorized as a form of hunting. 

What I am talking about in regards to the killing of Cecil is referred to as ""Trophy Hunting"" or poaching which is illegal.  As some hunters will rightly point out, humans have been taking the lives of animals since the dawn of our existence, and it is, therefore, natural. But paired with that instinct, rooted just as deep, is another quality that's uniquely human: a tendency to feel respect for the things we kill.

It is in our nature to hunt. But there's nothing natural about killing for fun.

For well over a century, trophy hunters from the U.S. and Europe have been shelling out money for the chance to shoot Africa's most iconic wildlife, like lions, elephants, and rhinos, posing proudly next to the corpses.

In the last five decades alone, lions have declined from over 100,000 across the continent to as few as 25,000. Still, trophy hunters kill roughly 600 of these animals every year, compounding lions' other threats, like habitat loss and retaliatory killing by villagers, prompting many conservationists to argue that lions should be listed as an endangered species.

Other endangered animals, such as rhinos and elephants, both popular trophy game, are faring even worse -- with some predicting that the latter could go extinct in a little over a decade.

Hunting or trapping for the purpose of providing meat for consumption or control of an over-run population can be thought of as a form of conservation.  It is impossible as man decides to encroach on the natural habitat of animals in order to build homes, shopping centers, highways, businesses and the ubiquitous parking lots that these animals will not become displaced.  As a result of this displacement, they will continue to multiply and pose a danger for themselves as well as the ""people population"".

Trophy hunting advocates tout the activity as a key form of conservation -- but in reality, it merely contributes to the gradual decimation of endangered species around the world. Cecil, the 13 year old lion,  was skinned and beheaded (no part of him was eaten), and the hunters tried to destroy the GPS collar that Cecil was wearing as part of research backed by Oxford University.  Thus it was known that this animal was not for the hunt.

And, as for helping the starving, skinny local African towns, very little of the revenue will go to them.  It usually provides wealth for the organizers.  Last year, hunters bid on  the right to hunt an endangered black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) in Namibia.  The permit was sold for $350,000, well above the previous high bid for a permit in that country, $223,000. It is quite common for an African nation to sell permits for trophy hunting, even for endangered species. Indeed, both Namibia and South Africa are legally permitted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to sell five permits for the hunting of adult male black rhinos each year.

Trophy hunters do not necessarily want to poach as in the case of the wealthy dentist from the Midwest.   A majority of hunters the researchers in a recent study that they preferred hunting in an area where they knew that a portion of the proceeds went back into local communities. Nearly half of the hunters they interviewed also indicated that they'd be willing to pay an equivalent price for a poorer trophy if it was a problem animal that would have had to be killed anyway.

These hunters, bay and large, also stated that they they were less willing to hunt in areas where wild dogs or cheetahs are illegally shot, in countries that intentionally surpass their quotas, or with operators who practice ""put-and-take hunting,"" which is where trophy animals are released onto a fenced-in property just before a hunt. Together this suggests that hunters were willing to place economic pressure on countries and tour companies to operate in as ethical a manner as possible.

428053320608798_876292722451520,"Good Tuesday Evening!

Ordinary Evil.

The mask of ""ordinary"" is powerful.  ""Ordinary"" events occur with regularity, nothing outlandish, nothing to fear.  ""Ordinary people"" are almost always ""well meaning"" and generally mindful of societal norms and habits, they conform to what society expects of them.  They do their jobs and are generally given the ""benefit of the doubt"" whenever there is some conflict or question.  When ""ordinary people"" do things that are considered ""out of the norm"", we have a tendency to to second guess what we see or hear, because the ""mask"" tells us that we can not believe what our ""lying eyes"" show us to be true.  The mask of ""ordinary"" can be a powerful tool.

Doing horrendous things in an orderly fashion depends upon the  ""normalization."" of an act by ""ordinary people"".  The process of ""normalization"" allows degrading acts of barbarism and the unspeakable behavior of one man or woman to another to become accepted as ""ordinary life"" or ""ordinary thinking"".   The normalization of the vicious and ugly behavior and practices for the behavior to take hold and become acceptable as ""the way things are done"".  Once this behavior is accepted, it becomes part of what is deemed to be ""fair"" and any movement against its grain is deemed to be ""unfair"".

Early in the last century, an ""ordinary woman"", with ""ordinary"" looks and even a ""motherly countenance"" said the following words:  ""Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race"" and even said, ""We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.""

""Oh shucks,"" you might say.....""she did not mean THAT"" .......  She just wants to ""empower women"".......  help the Black woman""....... ""heck and darn, she was just in-artful in her speech""......  But, with swift and deft precision, the organization that she founded can boast that according to a recent study from The Center for Disease Control 82 Percent of Abortions in New York City and 64% in Texas Were on Black or Hispanic Babies.

Once again, the mask of ""ordinary"" is powerful.

So..... let's take this a bit further......  Let us get attractive,  accomplished and vocal women to assure us that with the passage of Roe vs. Wade, we will finally achieve ""reproductive freedom"".  We call it ""Freedom of Choice"", which sounds like a glorious term and proclaim any person not ""with it"" to be ""out of the ordinary"" - you know a ""neanderthal"".....  The is deemed ""reproductive fairness"" even though (at the most) only 50% of the equation of an abortion will get a say in the matter.  The other half will, by definition, be ""silenced"".  

Now, take for example, the ""little kerfuffle"" with Planned Parenthood.  It appears that the ""ordinary looking doctors"" have been chopping the ""itty bitty"" parts and pieces of what could have been a great artist, engineer, doctor, philosopher or maybe just another ""ordinary person"" into tinier pieces and selling the parts off.... bit by bit.....  From what I have been told, this has become an ""ordinary practice""...... very similar to that of a ""chop shop"".  Those of us who have lived in a major city would know the concept of a ""chop shop"".  When my first car needed a new part, I went to the ""chop shop"" to get it.  They have every piece of a car, cataloged piece by piece.......  Some pieces are more expensive than others.  Same theory applied to the little intact baby livers.  Take for example the following scenario:

Holly O'Donnell, a licensed phlebotomist , took a job at Planned Parenthood thinking that her job was going to be just drawing blood, not procuring tissue from aborted fetuses,"" says O'Donnell, who fainted in shock on her first day of work in a Planned Parenthood clinic when suddenly asked to dissect a freshly-aborted fetus during her on-the-job training.

Her role soon expanded with her ability to scope out the room of sad pregnant souls in search of those who met criteria for fetal tissue orders and to harvest the fetal body parts after their abortions.  Her job became as ""ordinary"" as the burger maker at Burger King ensuring that the the customer was able to ""have it their way"".  ---- without the ""jingle ""of course.

The final part of the ""Danse Macabre"" of ""ordinariness"" is to convince the best and the brightest among us that they are doing a higher and nobler  (ad certainly more lucrative) level of work or maybe they have become so numb to the horror of their actions because of their training  and what they see.  Or maybe it is just the dehumanization of the ""lump of tissue"" that forms when the sperm fertilizes the egg..... that they treat the bits and pieces of humanity as parcels for sale.  Ordinary looking Deborah Nucatola, describes in the first video of this madness,  how Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of aborted unborn children and admitting she uses partial-birth abortions to supply intact body parts.All while stuffing her round face with salad and guzzling red wine.  

Dr. Maru Gatter, in the second video , tells a biotech company officials that the prices for such things as a baby's liver, head or heart are negotiable then jokes about selling enough to place her pale, bloodless body in a new Lamborghini.  Now with the third video, we are treated with Dr. Savita Ginde. at one of the largest and wealthiest Planned Parenthood affiliates which operates abortion clinics and abortion referral centers in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Nevada ---- (I just bet he can procure plenty of those ""baby livers"")

Well it seems that he, while standing in the Planned Parenthood abortion clinic pathology laboratory, where the bodies of babies are brought after abortions, he concludes that payment per organ removed from an aborted baby will be the most beneficial to Planned Parenthood: ""I think a per-item thing works a little better, just because we can see how much we can get out of it.""

Just like a ""chop shop"" piece by piece, car parts and now babies.  With the only exception ""The sale or purchase of human fetal tissue is a federal felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to $500,000 (42 U.S.C. 289g-2), though the law is riddled with loopholes that essentially allow such sales.""

I am not sure that it will only take three videos to take the ""ordinary"" out of chopping human beings up and selling the parts.  Even when as Dr. Maru Gatter pointed out that she wanted to avoid the ""crunchy parts""  (does she munch on the crunchy at the movies?)- ........  by the way, why does that not evoke the feeling to vomit?  Because it is part of ""normal and ordinary"".  Normal for the U.S. and for Canada, and Russia..... not so much in the rest of the world.  The idea of abortion up to the point of ""almost birth"" is something that most of the rest of the world would not view as an ordinary, ho-hum and business as usual.  

It appears that what money and power demand, science and technology will provide, however outrageous the end.  It is said that youth is wasted on the young.  As he ages, a man begins to realize his mortality and the need to prolong his presence on this earth.  The horror of what it takes to procure this false immortality, necessitates the normalization of this aforementioned  practice.  Just as slavery, misogyny, female genital mutilation, and other human constructs are explained away in the context of ""fairness""  or the ""ordinary"" ....... so will the Godless abuses by Planned Parenthood.

Eventually, harvesting body parts of the unfortunate will become the ""ordinary"" way of life in America........The mask of ""ordinary"" is powerful. Because .......all of this can't be as bad as our ""lying ears and eyes"" say it is.........

Or is it?  ""The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.""

Running with the Pack

""In politics you must always keep running with the pack. The moment that you falter and they sense that you are injured, the rest will turn on you like wolves.""

R. A. Butler

You really don't even have to be injured, you must simply have ideas, a personality or some characteristic that will suggest that you don't share the ""pack mentality"" of the rest.  You see, some of the 16 candidates running with the pack are really NOT running for President.  hey are running to be VP or at least included in the cabinet of the two or three that are really running.  The people of America know this.They instinctively know that they are being played.  They know that some of the younger candidates are running for the NEXT term since they have already given in to the idea that Hillary is ""unbeatable"", at least one or two want to be the Secretary of State and another Secretary of Defense.   Its all a game.  And then along came Trump....... and the denouncements.......  the calls by a deep throated Latin rapper by the name of ""Pitbull"" who calls himself ""Mr. Miami"" for a drug dealer who escaped prison in Mexico to attack the front-runner - Mr. Trump.  The one and only reason that they attack is fear and outrage that he is actually running..... because he is not one of them.  He is not playing ""by the rules"" ------ they want his money.... not him.  But the people think another way.  And always have......  He probably won't be president ---- there are too many tricks planned, but these tricks might deep-six if there is a third party run....

At the 1976 convention, only four US Congressmen to support Reagan over a sitting Republican president.  They questioned his intelligence and his depth......

(Is there any wonder that a smaller percentage of the adult populace is gainfully employed than at any time since the presidency of Jimmy Carter?)  Obama acts as if illegal aliens should swamp people here legally.  With the stroke of a pen, Obama undid the hard-won reforms of the welfare system in 1996; now the notion welfare state has an entirely new meaning in America.  Just one manifestation of Obama's accomplishments in building a larger welfare state in the U.S. is that more Americans are receiving what used to be called food stamps than at any time in our history.  Nearly half the population receives some kind of government benefit.

428053320608798_872996052781187,"Good Tuesday Morning!

Will We Ever Stand Up For What is Right Again?

Trump is surging in the polls.  He speaks his mind, regardless of the circumstance or the ""blow-back"" and he resonates with the people.  Do you agree with everything he says? Well, no one can agree all of the time, but he is a man who is not timid.  As the media circles and attacks, the public pays attention and moves to his side as the distrust of the media is at an all time high.  As the other candidates unwisely come forth one after the other making ridiculous demands that he ""drop out of the race"", the public realizes that this might amount to a plate of ""sour grapes"" since the losing Little League team might also want the winning team to ""drop out"".  As the Macy's or whatever store risks their already flagging foot traffic by joining with other corporate bullies to pressure him because they want to maintain the cheap labor that they glean from the illegal immigrants. the public perceives that this man ,Trump, is willing to put his money where his mouth is and they remain impressed.   Why is this happening?  Because at the very core, people understand the gross misbehavior, baffling values, violations of the constitution and racial animus promulgated over the past few years is part of the fundamental change that was promised.  They know that until one of the richest, brashest, and most unafraid men that they know spoke up, they felt collectively neutered.   He stands up, when they can't or won't.  So I ask....... will America ever stand up for what is right again when so much is wrong?  Let me give you some examples:

1.  The Charleston shooter was a 21 year old white male with very little education, a drug problem, and apparently some type of mental disorder.  In his ""manifesto"" he discusses the fact that he was unable to find many like minded people (KKK or Skinheads) in his native South Carolina so he reached out over the internet, developed some supremacy ideas, went into a famous African American church and committed a horrific crime of murder. A Presidential statement came soon afterwards and  he went to Charleston and delivered the eulogy at the funeral for the Reverend Clementa Pinckney.  A 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez., a Kuwaiti who has traveled back and forth to the Middle East shoots and kills 4 Marine recruiters and soon after a sailor dies and one other is still trying to recover....  The response from the president?  He responds that it is  ""heartbreaking"" in a speech making sure that you were told the shooter was a ""lone wolf""  even though he said that not much was known about the situation.  This was prior to vacationing in New York with his daughters and friends for the weekend.  Suffice to say he won't be singing Amazing Grace at these funerals.... it's politics all the time, all day, everyday.

2.  Soon after the shooting in Chattanooga, the media made the call that the shooter was a ""white male"".  After finding out that few ""white males"" have the name of Muhammad, the collective disappointment made them immediately proclaim that he was a ""lone wolf"", even after finding out about his trips to Kuwait, his manifesto, and statements.  We were to feel sorry for him and realize that he was an all America apple pie boy who was fired from his job which caused him to develop mental problems and use drugs - as if the average American boy has a father who was once on the terrorist watch list.  In other words, THE man made him do it.  Contrast, the 21 year old Dylan Roof was turned into the Grand Dragon of the KKK/Skinhead   Charleston chapter of 1.  Hundreds of Black people killed  each other last month in Chicago, Detroit, New York but this crazy young man becomes the catalyst for burning flags, fighting in the streets, gang beating a white man, the suggestion of a Mayor of a blighted community to dig up the bones of a confederate soldier from the local park, defacing historical monuments and a politician who is a descendant of the Confederacy providing an impassioned, embarrassingly self flagellating speech to tear down the flag.  Meanwhile, a young Black man shoots another in a major city.

3.  The Pentagon said the day after the attack it would continue to leave recruiters unarmed and unprotected, and ordered Marine recruiters to not wear their uniforms to work.  The Army tells the recruiters to ""pull the window blinds"".  One reporter was incensed because the investigators found a handgun inside the recruiter's office.  They got caught up in the fact that it is not allowed - to carry a gun to protect yourself if you are in uniform......  pulling the blinds at the window should suffice.

4. A Planned Parenthood doctor discusses methods of slicing the needed parts from aborted babies, crushing heads  and selling them.  She does this while enjoying a sumptuous green salad and guzzling red wine.  Planned Parenthood is the organization that honored President Obama in 2013.  He, in turn, ended his address to the largest abortion provider and now body part harvester and sales outlet,  in the U.S., by saying, ""God bless you.""   Since when did God Bless the murder of innocents?  One doctor in a subsequent video suggested she would sell enough to buy a luxury sports-car.  No matter how much you go to church, no matter how deep your faith..... your tax dollars provide the scalpel that cuts the liver out of the back of a sweet baby.  By the way both of the doctors are still working for the organization.

5.  Yesterday I listened to a very conservative station taking calls from veterans regarding the situation with John McCain.  It seems that the collective outrage regarding Trump making comments about not being a fan of John McCain is limited to McCain's friends, associates, family, fellow politicians and the media because the overwhelming message from the veterans was that they were one of the ""crazies"" that liked Donald Trump and he (McCain) was really ""not all that"".  But they did respect his service.  

This is but 5 examples, however, you get the picture.  A great deal of the voting public are confronted with these situations and more each day.  They realize the problems and are not buying what the politicians are selling. AND, the continued attacks on Trump may not get him to the White House, but it could ""deep six"" any hope that the huge mass of career politicians running against Trump will prevail against the Democratic challenger.  The media is just not  understanding that the people no longer care about the red and blue game........   They will not run in horror to the refuge of Jeb Bush....... as is being reported.   Common core, immigration amnesty, and tax reforms mean nothing to them as their basic needs for common decency is challenged on a daily basis ...... the public is neither interested nor engaged.   A hungry man is an angry man  and the average American is hungry for leadership, not politics as usual.

428053320608798_871061436307982,"Good Friday Morning!

The Press says:  ""The Shooter was a White Male""

I was at a luncheon yesterday in Dallas.  Allen was the speaker and the first part of the focus was on domestic issues, the last part was about problems on the international front, in specific Iran, ISIS/ISIL and threats.  Could an attack happen here?  What is the command climate in the military?

Unknown to us at the time, these questions were very prophetic, since by the time we got to the car and tried to check our cell phones, my iPad had a notice that there were 4 Marines down at a recruiting station in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  We turned on the news in the car and the horror started to stream in.  No names were mentioned but more than one broadcasters described the shooter as a ""white male"".  Of course we know that piece was not true, but how ""interesting"", to say the least.

According to Reuters on March 21, 2015, Islamic State posted online what it says are the names, U.S. addresses and photos of 100 American military service members, and called upon its ""brothers residing in America"" to kill them.

The Pentagon said after the information was posted on the Internet that it was investigating the matter. ""I can't confirm the validity of the information, but we are looking into it,"" a U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.

So the call was out.... slaughter American military.  So was denial..... they can't confirm the validity.  So months pass, nothing happens on the 4th of July, ..... the ""J.V. Squad"" does not strike, so we are ""home free"".  The ""myth"" of ""Islamic Extremism"" is a ""Right Wing Conspiracy"".  Right....Wrong.

A gunman unleashed a barrage of gunfire at two military facilities Thursday in Tennessee, killing four Marines and wounding two other service members and a police officer, officials told CBS News.

The shooter also was killed. Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the shooting suspect was identified as 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez. 

So he was not a ""white male"", after-all.......  and there are a couple  more items .......

1.  It appears that the 24 year old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez started saying rater prophetic things even when in high school.  ""My name causes national security alerts. What does yours do?""Are these the words of an ordinary 18 year old high school graduate?  How chilling could it be to realize that for several years the animus towards Americans boiled just beneath the surface? 

2.  It also is important to note that at some point ""lone wolves"" become packs of wolves.  What is wrong with people recognizing that bad things such as ""sleeper cells"" exist in our society and people do mean harm?  The family lived in a solid,picturesque neighborhood.  Abdulazeez was a starter for the varsity wrestling team at Red Bank High School,  he liked beer and played football while his former MMA coach Scott Schrader told CNN: 'He was the All-American kid'. His sisters babysat for neighbors and one was supposedly an excellent 4th grade teacher before recently leaving the position abruptly.

His father was appointed as a 'special policeman' for local public works in 2005, but it has been revealed he was investigated several years ago because of possible links to terrorism.  

Who could tell?

But the narrative that the ""shooter was a white male"", was perhaps just ""wishful thinking"" on the part of the press.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/871061436307982/?type=3,2015-07-17 08:03:50,44,12,17,44,0,0,0,0,0

Hannibal Lecter ain't got nothing on the profit-maximizing abortion ghoul caught on tape hawking aborted baby parts as she swilled wine and nibbled on a gourmet salad.
In newly released undercover footage from the pro-life Center for Medical Progress, seasoned abortionist Dr. Deborah Nucatola, who serves as national senior director of ""medical services"" at Planned Parenthood, chitter-chattered eagerly about fulfilling the bloodthirsty demand for ""intact hearts,"" ""lower extremities"" and lungs.
Price tag? ""You know, I would throw a number out,"" she babbled breezily as she twirled her fork. ""I would say it's probably anywhere from $30 to $100"" per specimen.
Hollywood couldn't conjure monsters this chillingly, banally evil.
Nucatola exulted at how fetal livers have become tres chic: ""A LOT of people"" want them.
She then spoke of the new hot trends in body-parts trafficking as if she were raving about the latest craze for crop tops or artisanal cheese.
""I was like wow,"" she gushed to her potential clients about the market for unborn baby hearts, ""I didn't even know!""
Like wow.
This master of murderous euphemism repeatedly referred to an unborn baby's head as a ""calvarium"" and casually described the tricks and techniques she and her fellow abortionists use to ""increase your chance of success."" Rotating the babies so they are delivered breech before being mutilated and slaughtered by the practitioners of Planned Butcherhood works fabulously, in case you were wondering.
Pausing only to swig more luxury libations from her jumbo wine glass, the loquacious death doc explained to investigators posing as fetal tissue company executives how her ""providers"" use ""ultrasound guidance"" to target the coveted body parts -- ""so they'll know where they're putting their forceps.""
In a singsong recitation, this lettuce-chomping Mengele in a silk tank top detailed how the ""providers"" use ultrasound to become ""cognizant of where you put your graspers.""
This method is not employed to reduce the pain and suffering of unborn baby and mother, mind you. It's to get ""good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that -- so I'm not gonna crush that part. I'm going to basically crush below, I'm gonna crush above, and I'm gonna see if I can get it all intact.""
Think about that. Planned Parenthood has officially declared it ""torture"" for women to see their unborn children through ultrasound before submitting to abortion. The billion-dollar abortion industry has lobbied vociferously against increasing ultrasound access to pregnant women on the fence about abortion.
But when the same imaging technology is used to help Planned Butcherhood's ""providers"" place their forceps strategically to protect their precious organ commodities, it's invaluable ""guidance.""
Now you know if you didn't already or if you were in abject denial. Planned Parenthood's fetish for late-term abortion stems not from compassion for mothers, but from the cold-blooded drive to drum up cold, hard cash. The practice has continued for at least 15 years, when Planned Parenthood's human harvesters in Kansas were first uncovered.
Can it get any more stomach-turning? Brace yourselves. This video is just the first in a series by the Center for Medical Progress, which has been investigating Planned Butcherhood's illegal, immoral trafficking of aborted fetal parts for almost three years.
The expose comes after years of undercover journalistic work by Lila Grace Rose and Live Action, who have caught government-supported Planned Parenthood officials covering up for sexual predators, promoting gendercide, flouting health regulations and disclosure laws, soliciting money from racist eugenics zealots who want more black babies aborted, and perpetuating a homicidal racket in the name of ""reproductive health.""
Nucatola is no rogue underling. She's Planned Parenthood's ""senior director"" of ""medical services"" with years of scalpel-wielding, hands-on abortion training. She bragged not only about her own expertise in procurement of baby body parts, but about the everyday trafficking that goes on ""behind closed doors"" at countless ""affiliates.""
When you've recovered from your nausea, ask yourselves this: What kind of country do we live in where law-abiding businesses are fined, threatened and demonized for refusing to bake gay wedding cakes, but barbaric baby butchers are hailed by feminists, Hollywood and a president who asked God to ""bless"" them?
God help us.

On July 16, 1936, photographer Walker Evans (1903-75) took a leave of absence from the Farm Security Administration (FSA) to accept a summer assignment with Fortune magazine. Evans, who had begun working as a photographer in 1928, had developed a modest reputation by the time that he was hired in October 1935 by Roy Stryker, then leader of the FSA photographic section. Stryker agreed to grant him leave for the magazine assignment on the condition that his photographs remained government property.

Evans and the writer James Agee spent several weeks among sharecropper families in Hale County, Alabama. The article they produced documented in words and images the lives of poor Southern farmers afflicted by the Great Depression; their work, however, did not meet Fortune's expectations and was rejected for publication.

Evans' desire to produce photographs that were ""pure record not propaganda"" did not harmonize with Stryker's emphasis on the use of the image to promote social activism. Soon after the Alabama series was completed, Evans returned to New York. There Evans and Agee reworked their material and searched for another publisher. In 1941, the expanded version of their story was published in book form as Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, now recognized as a masterpiece of the art of photojournalism.
Walker Evans went on to exhibit and publish his work (he was a staff photographer at Fortune, 1945-65) and to teach at the Yale University School of Art and Architecture. James Agee became one of America's most influential film critics as well as a poet, novelist, and screenwriter. James Agee died in 1955; Walker Evans died in 1975.

The Cold Heart

""Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. ""Because lawlessness is increased, most people's love will grow cold.""

I watched her nonchalantly eat from the bowl of green salad, perched beside her glass of Merlot, or is it Chianti as she discussed the sale of hearts, livers, lower extremities..... perhaps for the muscle.  The ""customers"" fill out an order form.  Do they want a cadaver or do they want fetal tissue, how old, what types.......  and finally......  How would you like that shipped?  Fed - Ex or something a bit faster.....perhaps same day,  by hand... if availability dictates this quickness....

Ummmmm...... the salad is so fresh, the restaurant is so clean and the service is sooo good.  The atmosphere is heavenly for the chosen who win the lottery of being wanted, raised, educated and nurtured.  

But back to this surreal scene which seems right out of a dystopian melodrama.   Dr. Deborah Nucatola discussed the sale of human body parts harvested as unwanted waste from wombs of women eager to ""return"" to their lives.  Free to choose life or death.  In these cases death won out.   

The precious creation produced out of a few moments of frenzied lust, then perhaps fear or regret.... now for sale at a price between 30 to 100 dollars.  She takes one big mouthful of the delicious salad, and a gulp of her wine as she discusses the sale of a wee lad's liver, but first making sure that the babe's liver is not damaged by the foreceps as he is torn from the protective womb.  Her exact words are:

""We've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I'm not gonna crush that part, I'm gonna basically crush below, I'm gonna crush above, and I'm gonna see if I can get it all intact.""  She is good at delivering the ""goods"" and she even promises  ""if I know what they're looking for, I'll just keep it in the back of my mind, and try to at least keep that part intact.""

No need to preserve all parts, since as long as there is the need, as long as there is a moment of lust followed by regret or un-want or rape ..... there will be another specimen/baby/fetus ready. A very renewable supply.

So....... if you need the lower extremities...... they use ultrasound to move the baby into a breech position and then the lower extremities will fall out first, without being damaged.

Dr. Deborah Nucatola, takes my breath away, the only other doctor I can think of is a gentleman who collected the eyes of his murdered victims, in part to furnish ""research material"" to colleague Karin Magnussen, a KWI researcher of eye pigmentation. He himself also conducted several experiments in an attempt to unlock the secret of artificially changing eye color.  His name was Josef Mengele, perhaps back in time they could have shared a bottle of Liebfraumilch, which was reportedly his favorite wine.

A quote from the founder of Planned Parenthood is probably appropriate here:  

""A mutual and satisfied sexual act is of great benefit to the average woman, the magnetism of it is health giving. When it is not desired on the part of the woman and she gives no response, it should not take place.""

I suppose when taken into consideration.........  her organization has achieved its goals.  He is probably pleased, wherever her eternal home may be.

Dr. Nucatola should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  Planned Parenthood and its complex fetal body trafficking business should be de-funded.  A nation can not traffic the pieces of its babies and support this with tax dollars.......  THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT ""CHOICE"".  The full transcript is below.....

Problem:  Freedom also means the freedom to experiment..... in many ways.  Where does the line cross between consensual sexual encounters and sexual assault?  For many with sons, the thought of a party involving too much to drink and an amorous encounter with a young woman might grip you with fear given the fact that the intensified crackdown on campus sexual assault over the last few years has at times skewed too far against those accused.

On the basis of just the word of the accuser, the fellow might be accused of something that would put him in prison or having to register as a sex offender.  We have witnessed false stories in the past year, justified by the media as ""well it is occurring you know"" and somehow indicating that the innocent should have to pay for all of the other guy's wrong-doings..... if he is indeed innocent.  

Sometimes, because there IS truly a difference in motives......  the  young lady might be looking for ""l.o.v.e"" while the guy is really only in love with the ""hook up"".  Listening to the popular music glamorize the act which essentially has not changed one iota since Adam and Eve bit the naughty apple, a young girl might believe that she has something unique to offer. The rude awakening comes and the bruised feelings might allow for feelings of ""hurt"".  

Nationally, more than 40 accused students have filed lawsuits against their campuses, arguing that their rights to a fair hearing were violated. At the same time, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights is investigating more than 100 campuses for allegedly failing to properly handle sexual assault complaints, including UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Santa Cruz, UC Davis, Stanford University, USC, Occidental College and San Francisco State.  

In the San Diego case, Doe met the accuser, identified in court papers as Jane Roe, at a party in January 2014 and began engaging in consensual oral sex later that month. On Jan. 31, 2014, the couple went to a fraternity party and returned to his apartment, where they had sexual intercourse and woke up in bed together the next morning.

FOUR MONTHS later, she filed a complaint alleging two instances of sexual activity without her consent and a third charge of retaliation.

The 21-year-old, who had denied all charges against him, took her AND the university to court.... and won.He said he had attended the university's training on alcohol awareness and sexual misconduct and was keenly aware of the need to make sure that any sex was consensual. But he said it seemed he was presumed guilty from the start.

MANY people feel that the accusation of rape should be given more weight and that women don't report rape because they are intimidated.

Police seek bank robber who used lotion as a disguise
BRENDAN GIBBONSPublished: July 14, 2015

A man who smeared white lotion on his face to disguise his appearance robbed a West Scranton bank Tuesday afternoon, Scranton police said.

The man walked into the PNC Bank branch office at 136 S. Main Ave. around 2 p.m. and demanded money, Chief Carl Graziano said.

Witnesses described him as a black man with white lotion on his face, 6 feet 2 inches tall, thin build, wearing light blue pants, a blue long-sleeve shirt and a bucket hat, he said.

Though he threatened employees with a weapon, he did not display it, the chief said.

He took an undisclosed amount of money from the teller, then headed south on South Hyde Park Avenue in an older model red Cadillac, possibly an Eldorado.

Late Tuesday, PNC officials could not comment on the robbery.

Anyone with information should call Scranton police at 570-348-4134.

428053320608798_870176223063170,"Good Wednesday Morning!

The ""It"" Girl 

""Ladies, we have work to do and the time is now.""  These words ended her speech to the NAACP.   

But from the beginning, Marilyn Mosby knew that this was her moment, as much as she told the crowd when indicting the 6 officers in the death of Freddie Gray:  ""To the youth of this city, I will seek justice on your behalf. This is a moment. This is your moment,"" 

She told her personal story, inspiring the crowd to understand and appreciate the ""hardships"" she experienced as she rose to the position she now holds as she stood speaking to the crowd at the NAACP.  At 35, she is the youngest chief prosecutor in any major American city. 

She shared personal struggles including the loss of a beloved cousin when she was 14 that she said helped her turn her pain into her passion to reform the criminal justice system. She the pain she experienced when she was wait-listed at every law school she'd applied to because of very low LSAT scores and then failed the bar exam the first time she took it. She described how others had doubted her, sometimes causing her to doubt herself.

She outlined her election to the position she holds:

 ""For me, as a young black woman, to run against an older white male incumbent, powerful, with the ability to raise close to a million dollars, the skeptics wanted to know: How could I have the audacity?""

She told of threats:

""I was told I was too inexperienced, that I couldn't raise enough money, that my decision to run could not only disrupt but potentially destroy my husband's political career,""

She is married to Nick Mosby, a Baltimore city councilman. They have been married since 2005. They have two daughters. They live in the Reservoir Hill neighborhood of Baltimore.

So she persevered..... and was thrust into the national spotlight in April after 25-year-old Freddie Gray was arrested and suffered a spinal injury while being transported in a police van. He died a week later.

""Law enforcement is pretty much instilled within my being,"" Mosby told MSNBC's Chris Hayes on May 1, the day she publicly announced charges against the officers. ""I come from five generations of police officers,"" she added, pointing out that her mother, father, grandfather and uncles have all served as cops.

We were all impressed with this account because she knew that in making it she implied ""who me?  despite the strange and theatrical rhetoric...... I can't possibly have a personal problem with cops.......  my folks were/are all cops!""

She left out a few details, however:

>Mosby's mother, Linda Thompson, first violated the Boston police department's substance abuse policy in 2006. After serving a 45-day rehab stint, Thompson violated the drug code again and voluntarily resigned on Feb. 1, 2008, rather than be fired.  Thompson, now 52, to draw a $1,810.69 monthly pension.  Colleagues say ""she was always ""high"".  She also drew raised eyebrows after the acquittal of OJ for the murder of his wife and friend when she ( Linda Thompson) jumped up on the desk of another officer and began ""doing a victory dance.""

>Mosby's father was fired from the Boston police department in 1991 following accusations that he and his partner robbed drug dealers at gun point. 

>Mosby's uncle was fired from Boston PD in 2001 after testing positive for cocaine. 

>Her grandfather was a well-respected Boston cop, but he ultimately and unsuccessfully sued the department for racial discrimination in the 1980s.

None of this was mentioned when she indicated:  ""You can trust me, I come from a family of cops.""

The public got an apparent glimpse of Mosby's sentiment towards the cops when she ""favorited"" two controversial tweets on May 6. One tweet called the officers ""thugs"" and another asserted that the young prosecutor ""INFURIATES a certain kind of white person."" Mosby denied favoriting the tweets, saying that her account was hacked. However, her personal account showed no other evidence of being infiltrated.

The Mosbys (Nick and Marylynn) have been featured prominently at some public events since Marilyn Mosby gained national attention May 1 after charging six officers involved in the arrest of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old whose death in police custody sparked rioting in Baltimore. They couple drew attention when they attended a Prince benefit concert in Baltimore, and the two served as honorary ringmasters at the UniverSoul Circus at Security Square Mall.

Dancing with Prince, ringmasters in a circus, posing for fashion magazines....... all benefit of a flimsy case which will destroy the lives and livelihood of 6 police officers. Days before that speech and subsequent charges— and before the medical examiner's office had even determined Gray's cause of death — she told a group of local clergy members that she was going to seek justice for Gray ""by any and all means necessary.""

In 2015, Mosby charged six police officers, who arrested Freddie Gray prior to his death, with a variety of crimes including second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. Mosby has been criticized for ordering the increased police presence, in the same neighbhorhood that Gray was arrested, just weeks prior to the incident that occurred. Anonymous sources have been reported by CNN as saying the Baltimore police's investigation does not support some of the charges brought against the officers.

Mosby has repeatedly declined to discuss her evidence against the officers, saying she doesn't want to litigate the case in the media.  

Or maybe because the evidence will not support her case.......  either way, she is enjoying her moment(s) because she certainly is ""it"".  They had to cancel the fundraiser...... another struggle.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/870176223063170/?type=3,2015-07-15 07:56:26,23,14,27,23,0,0,0,0,0

The ""Elder-Orphans""

""Forever Young"" is a song by Bob Dylan, recorded in California in November 1973, released in January 1974.  it spoke to a generation with the opening lyrics:

""May you build a ladder to the stars 
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young ""

If you graduated from high school that spring of 1974, today you would be 59 years old.  You would be 63 if you were 22 and just graduated from college, either way, you had were our of the ""Viet - Nam"" era ... essentially.  ""Novelist Tom Wolfe coined the term ""'Me' decade"" in his essay ""The 'Me' Decade and the Third Great Awakening"", published by New York magazine in August 1976 referring to the 1970s. The term describes a general new attitude of Americans towards atomized individualism. 

Self actualization was the goal of these ""Baby Boomers"". The Second-Wave Feminist Movement in the United States which began in the 1960s carried over to the 1970s, and took a prominent role within society.  The gay movement made a huge step forward in the 1970s with the election of political figures such as Harvey Milk to public office and the advocating of anti-gay discrimination legislation passed and not passed during the decade. Many celebrities, including Freddie Mercury and Andy Warhol, also ""came out"" during this decade, bringing gay culture further into the limelight.

African-Americans in the 70s and 80s The 1970s was a decade of progress and achievement for African-Americans. In 1970, the Black population numbered 22.6 million, representing about 11 percent of the total U.S. population and accounting for nearly 90% of all minorities in the U.S. In the decade following the Civil Rights movement, African-Americans fought through barriers in many areas to achieve the equality they rightfully deserved.

In just about every part of society, the 1970's were exciting, full of change and certainly interesting.  Those who were ""young"" during this decade were certainly ""building a ladder to the stars"".  And because of this, they thought they would be ""Forever Young"".

With the advent of the pill, rise of opportunities outside of the  home, and the changing views of society, many of the ""Baby Boomers: decided that it was well within their interests to ""put off"" certain things...... after all, remaining ""forever young"" means that the need to think about marriage and children can wait..... right?

Wrong...... This generation was one of the first that elected not to have children.

According to U.S. Census data, about one-third of Americans aged 45 to 63 are single, a 50% increase from 1980, and nearly 19% of women aged 40 to 44 have no children, compared to 10% in 1980.  I have more friends who have NO children than have.  Whether it's seeing other women raising kids in unsuccessful relationships, parents who have struggled with difficult children, or seeing women who have lost part of their identity to their children, there are many external reasons that my friends have given for their decision to forgo having children or even being or staying married.

So...... what happens when ""that age"" comes upon you?  When you no longer get up in the morning feeling that you can ""slay the dragons""  or at least run 5 miles before putting in 8 hours at work and then dancing until the wee hours of the morning?  At least I can remember getting off of work at 5:30 in Munich, getting to my flat where all my ""roomies"" were also declaring that they were too tired to go out and then someone flips on the music........ we would be downtown within the 2 hours and looking fabulous after a 30 minute ""power nap"" and shower.  I wish we could all be THAT ""forever young"".

But we can't..... stay forever young......about 60% of nursing home residents do not have regular visitors because they have no ""family"".

For those who bit the idea of the impending doom from the population explosion of the 1970's, they would be proud to know that  U.S. fertility rates have reached another record low, at 62.5 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age, according to the most recent government figures. 

""Elder orphans."" These seniors are single or widowed; they have no children, at least in the area, and no support system. And they find themselves alone with no one to help care for them when they need it. About 22% of Americans 65 years and older are in danger of becoming, or already are, in this situation. As of 2012, there were 43 million people over 65 in the U.S., up from 35 million in 2002.

Many of the people who fall into this sector of society may have had long marriages where they decided not to have children, prepared financially and built up a network of friends, both in their age group and younger, to help them when they need it.   One problem here, friends have families also, unless they too are alone,  who might take priority over YOU.  

This is a population that can utilize expensive healthcare resources because they don't have the ability to access community resources while they're well but alone.  From hospice to in-home services, the healthcare system is based on an assumption that family members will be there to shoulder the majority of care. When no family is available, elder orphans are created.

So why is it important to identify this group?  Primarily because they vote and they have already been identified by those wishing to make sure that Obamacare stays in place, the group that will also seize upon any ""bold move"" to change ""entitlements""..  Running on the issue of ""repeal"" might not be the ticket....especially with this growing group.   There is little research on how these seniors will affect society and the medical system in the years to come. Hospital social workers and geriatricians already see elder orphans in their work every week. "" Elder orphans"" are hard on the medical system, since they are often in crisis and need to seek help from costly hospital emergency rooms. 

Having a spouse and children will not necessarily guarantee help and support in your senior years, I am not taking a position on that either way, however, it is one factor to take into consideration when formulating your political decisions. Because:

                       ""May your feet always be swift
                        May you have a strong foundation 
                        When the winds of changes shift
                        May your heart always be joyful 
                        And may your song always be sung
                        May you stay forever young""

Are only the lyrics to a song. This group is fearful of change and rightfully so.  Even the women from ""Sex in the City"" (Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte) are now between the ages of 50 and just shy of 60 years old....  it happens....Changes to health care, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other social ""cradles"" might be a ""non-go"" here because they are unique in one aspect....... They have few options.  the one emotion that they do have , though, is fear.... and rightfully so.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/869262613154531/?type=3,2015-07-13 11:29:57,5,4,14,5,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_868670623213730,"Good Sunday Morning!

Symbolic Acts Defining The New America.

What is a ""symbol""?  The meaning ""something which stands for something else"".  That something can be an art object, a flag, book, people, places or things..... in other words... A symbol can be ""profane"" or ""sacred"".  Emile Durkheim was a French sociologist who is credited with the concept of ""sacred and profane"".  Sacred symbols are those things we set apart as extraordinary, inspiring awe and reverence.  Symbols such as the Bible for Christians, the Torah for Jews or the Qur'an for Muslims are considered ""sacred"".  The ""profane"" , however, are those symbols and activities that are routine aspects of our day to day existence.  

Let's discuss for one moment the key word here...... ""reverence"",  It is often difficult, especially in today's world to ""wrap our heads around"" something that is ""sacred"".  Why?  Because to acknowledge something as ""sacred"" means that we must become ""respectful"".  Respect is something that is the antithesis of what we want to do in the world that says ""if it feels good, do it"".  So we attend churches without the ""Cross"", because this allows the preacher to speak about whatever he ""feels"" with just some peppering here and there of scripture.  Writers have a tendency to also remove Scripture from the Bible in order to prove a point.  They ""adapt"" the teachings of whatever passage they want to prove their point.  I often get into discussions with people who start by telling me the chapter and verse of their scripture..... this is called ""mystifying"" because they are attempting to make you shut up by proving how ""holy"" they are without actually acknowledging how ""holey"" their argument was.  

We then wear the cross as a body ornament around our waists, we then attempt to make,( with some success I might add) something that was once considered ""sacred"", profane.  Here are two other examples:

1>  Marriage:  Marriage is the most basic and significant social relationship to humankind, this was once sacred. This relationship must be nurtured and maintained for the welfare of all. Without marriage, society will fail.  Within the Black community 78 percent or so children grow up without the benefit of a two parent household.  I have mentored many of the girls who have grown up not knowing their fathers and having mothers who are constantly chasing the illusive husband. The cycle starts out simply enough.  The young girl falls ""in love"", the young man falls ""in lust"".  She announces ""I'm pregnant"", he drifts, disappears or simply shows up intermittently throughout before either physically or mentally leaving.  The young girl leaves school.  She then begins another relationship, she gets pregnant again..... and the cycle continues.  I knew of one young woman who told me that between both parents there were 5 ""moms and dads"" and 18 full and half siblings. She said whenever she got ""tired"" of one parent ""nagging"" she would go to another.  On the 18, 4 were in or just out of jail and she was the first to graduate high school.  To a lesser degree this is practiced by different ethnic groups, however, as we move into a ""trans-racial"" society and people marry across ethnic and economic groups, we will find that the statistics and behaviors will become the same or at least averaged along the spectrum as we are all members of the ""human race"" after all.

The second issue here is the concept of ""state defined"" marriage.  As we move towards a ""centrally controlled"", secular form of America..... to our own detriment...., The state has told us that ""marriage"" is no longer between a ""man and a woman"" and that it was never defined that way in the ""new"" bible.  Well, in direct contradiction to Ephesians 5:25 that instructs ""Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.""  The operative words here are ""husband"" which is ""he"" and wives , which is ""her"".  Male and female.  Now, one can argue that ""pish, posh"".... he really meant that in a ""figurative"" way..... it could mean ""he and he"" or ""she and she"", because Angela....... who are you to say how two people should love one another?  

Quite frankly, I would answer, I am not ""in charge of you"", and truly I have no opinion about your lives.... I accept people as they are .  But also, I did not write the Book (Bible), I am only a flawed messenger who 4 times a week writes a blog.  In addition, having once lived for two years in a very nice and very gay section of Manhattan, I am not wrapped up in moralizing or self righteous behavior.  I have met many a heterosexual, ""church going"", ""saved, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost"", judgmental and hypocritical prudes that I have nothing to do with because of the stingy area of their heart they give to others.    But I ask you, if you re-define marriage, won't you have to do it again and again and again?  In Biblical times, polygamy was common and necessary often because of the mortality rate.   Polygamy is the practice or condition of having more than one  wife, at one time. Polyandry is the practice of one woman taking more than one male as a spouse.  Are we ready for that one?  Or what about the continuous string -- maybe 2 guys and 2 gals, or any other continuous string which will come to resemble a legal orgy.  

Let me make this clear, any man-made law can and will be changed again.  And finally, we don't live forever.  What about the children...........  The media has successfully ""shut up and shut out"" dissenting voices of the children of same sex unions.  You will find in liberal publications how ""happy"" and ""accomplished"" these children are ---- much MORE so that those raised in happy heterosexual unions.  If this were true, then shouldn't we ALL become homosexual because it is so much fun, enjoyable and stylish.... not to mention great for children?  Simple minds read this garbage and believe it........  

>Culture and Decency. As outline earlier this past week, there is a movement to erase history and replace it with some revised version of fantasy and light that will make everyone FEEL good.  Rep. Jenny Horne, R-Summerville, got emotional as she spoke during debate over a Senate bill calling for the Confederate flag to be removed from the Capitol grounds Wednesday, July 8, 2015, in Columbia.  I was embarrassed for her, because although she (Horne) said her powerful words were not planned, the reality was that she was so impassioned with guilt and so mindful that she would be famous for a little while that she sparked a movement to promote mass ignorance.

Historical symbols are just that.  They exist because events in history existed. Now the mayor of Memphis wants to disturb the bones of confederate figures buried beneath a park.  You see to do this would require a backhoe and shovels. To solve the real problems of a predominantly Black city such as Memphis would require real work.  Good or bad, right or wrong, events in history occurred and we study them objectively to make sure that they don't happen again or that we emulate the good things.  Or that we simply learn and meditate.  Are we really prepared to desecrate the memory of the ultimate founding father, George Washington because he had 318 slaves?  

What about Stone Mountain, Georgia? Should we ""sand blast this monument where ""The largest high relief sculpture in the world, the Confederate Memorial Carving, depicts three Confederate heroes of the Civil War, President Jefferson Davis and Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson. The entire carved surface measures three-acres, larger than a football field and Mount Rushmore.""  And who should we put it its place? Lucile Ball, Frank Sinatra, the Notorious Biggie, Tu Pac and Jackie ""Moms"" Mabley?  How ""sacred"" will that be?

Let me make this clear......Joel A. Rogers noted this phenomenon in his 100 Amazing Facts: ""The Negro slave-holders, like the white ones, fought to keep their chattels in the Civil War."" Rogers also notes that some black men, including those in New Orleans at the outbreak of the War, ""fought to perpetuate slavery.""

That's right boys and girls, there were BLACK slaveholders.  John Carruthers Stanly owned three plantations and 163 slaves, and even hired three white overseers to manage his property! He fathered six children with a slave woman named Kitty, and he eventually freed them. William Ellison,  at his death on the eve of the Civil War, Ellison was wealthier than nine out of 10 white people in South Carolina. He owned 900 acres of land and 63 slaves. Not one of his slaves was allowed to purchase his or her own freedom.  Antoine Dubuclet and his wife Claire Pollard owned more than 70 slaves in Iberville Parish when they married.  Hannah Leion owned nine slaves, while the largest slaveholder in 1860 was Ciprien Ricard, who had a sugarcane plantation in Louisiana and owned 152 slaves with her son, Pierre -- many more that the 35 she owned in 1830. Slave-holding was not the ""sacred"" domain of white people.

Lastly lets talk about decency.  It is now impossible to reprimand any child and especially a child of color in any public school system today.  As they watch their elders scream ""racism"" even when they are wrong, they learn this behavior and in turn attack their teachers.  Public urination by dirty male hobos in New York will become the anatomy lesson your 12 year old will get as his/her school field trip bus rolls into the ""Big Apple"" if if Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito gets her way.  In transit hubs, including Penn Station, are plagued by surging numbers of homeless people who publicly masturbate, harass bystanders and demand free food as the city looks the other way.  One can say this is a lesson in life, however, what type of life are you speaking of?  I was sent a picture of people wiping themselves after defecating on the American flag.  

Wake up people, they want not just to defecate on the flag but also to turn your life into that level of excrement. The flag was once ""sacred"", now rendered ""profane"" in the most profane of ways.  Begin to care. Our life and the quality thereof is quite ""sacred"".

428053320608798_867577439989715,"A reader cited objection to the possibility of criticism where the pope is concerned and cited:

The Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992)

2424 A theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end of economic activity is morally unacceptable. The disordered desire for money cannot but produce perverse effects. It is one of the causes of the many conflicts which disturb the social order.

A system that ""subordinates the basic rights of individuals and of groups to the collective organization of production"" is contrary to human dignity. Every practice that reduces persons to nothing more than a means of profit enslaves man, leads to idolizing money, and contributes to the spread of atheism. ""You cannot serve God and mammon.""

Answer:  ""The Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992)"" was put forth in 1992, my Bible existed long before this 24 year old, man made document.   

So let's break this down.......In 1992, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) noted:

It clearly show[s] that the problem of what we must do as human beings, of how we should live our lives so that we and the world may become just, is the essential problem of our day, and basically of all ages. After the fall of ideologies, the problem of man—the moral problem—is presented to today's context in a totally new way: What should we do? How does life become just? What can give us and the whole world a future which is worth living? Since the catechism treats these questions, it is a book which interests many people, far beyond purely theological or ecclesiastical circles.

The concept of ""just"" is vague and subjective alluding to how we treat people i.e. the ""just wage"".  First and foremost, the wages of the American people far outpace any and all other societies.  

Let me move the bar a little more..... 

People in America, often when speaking of ""just and fair"" compensation are often thinking about what is JUST and FAIR to them, not to others.  The man/woman who sleeps until 10, works just enough instead of hard, and cuts short his/her education loathes to take these factors into consideration when calculating what is just.  

It is certainly complicated, however, when prescribing Catholic remedies to a world largely non-Catholic invites profane interpretation and abuse.  

In addition, once demonizing the so called rich who provide the jobs and wages...... what would he suggest if they disappear?  Central control of the state to distribute the ""just and fair"" gifts to people?  That has been tried before, and the end state has been disastrous and deleterious to many.....",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/867577439989715/?type=3,2015-07-10 09:12:40,8,8,1,8,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_867377040009755,"Good Thursday Evening!

The Hysteria to Wipe Away History..... in one city ---- Memphis

George Orwell's 1984 preceded this modern drama that seems to have gripped our society.  The disturbing premise for the book 1984 is that If you revise history enough to serve your purposes, and indoctrinate them in classrooms and from loudspeakers( such as television, the media and the internet), enforcing this one-sided social contract with violence and mass ridicule against the ""independent thinker"", humans will fall into line.  Orwell said, like so many sheep, people will believe whatever they are told,no matter how fantastical, untrue  or irrational it might be.  People on the whole find independent thought painful and time consuming.  They would rather go along with the crowd rather than risk the loss of friendship, no matter how shallow that ""friendship"" might be.  They know intuitively that the need for this affiliation is worthless which causes them to lash out at anyone who might prove then that their lives were essentially wasted and worthless.

Such is the mass hysteria behind the drive to tear down Confederate flags, dig up the bones of the families of the Confederate soldiers, and destroy the monuments of any soldier who has fought on the side of the Confederacy.  The hew and cry, splatters of paint and town meetings to destroy historical fact is sheer and utter madness.  This impotence symbolizes the move of the American people towards a lack of hope and the dis-belief in what has set us apart from most of the world --- the belief in American exceptionalism.

Exceptionalism is the perception that a country, society, institution, movement, or time period is ""exceptional"" (i.e., unusual or extraordinary) in some way.......  We were and are exceptional.  We are the ONLY country in which you can come from the bottom and rise to the top.  Try pulling that off as a ""brown"" person or woman  in any other nation, I have had the pleasure of living in several and it ain't even in the realm of possibility.  So as lousy as you might feel it is here, try it somewhere else.

Further....... what do you lose by trying to erase the vestiges of historical fact?  Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton wants to dig up the bodies of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his wife and remove them from a city park in the latest and perhaps most despicable example of the anti-Southern cleansing spreading across the nation.

""Which African-American wants to have a picnic in the shadow of Nathan Bedford Forrest?"" Wharton said in a Thursday press briefing.

So the best thing to do is dig up bones.

Hmmmmmmm......Memphis is plagued by dictatorship-like politics, a dynasty of shady (black) politicians that have trouble all the way to the federal level, care nothing about their fellow men, much less their fellow black men. White flight and businesses leaving the city have left it a shadow of what it used to be.  There are failing schools, lack of leadership, crime and continuing issues with youth.   Willie Herenton was the mayor of Memphis; he served as Memphis' mayor for almost two decades.  Typically, having a black mayor would encourage and promote racial unity.  However, Mayor Herenton actually further disrupted racial lines by falsely accusing race as the cause of many of Memphis' problems.  Mr. Herenton often abused his power by pulling out the ""race card"" when it was unnecessary.   

Racial discrimination has recently been made an issue on the University of Memphis campus.  Larry Moore, an associate professor at the U of M, has decided to sue the university for $551.7 million.  Mr. Moore claims that his application for promotion to professor was rejected because of racial bias.  However, The University claims that Moore's application was denied because he did not write a textbook he claimed to have written.   Ummmmm...... the textbook either exists or it does not...... in this case it did not,  so.... no tenure, no promotion.  Black ""lives"" matter and so do ""lies"".

""According to the 2014 Tennessee Code (Title 4 - State Government, Chapter 1 - General Provisions, Part 4 – Miscellaneous; § 4-1-412 - Tennessee heritage protection) any such move is clearly illegal and thank God it was put in place before less than 30 days of ridiculous hysteria has caused our publicly-elected officials to wilt like puny marigolds in the July heat.""http://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/7/9/303864/Roy-Exum-Memphis-Flouts-State-Law.aspx

The slogan often used at these gatherings or the defacement of property is ""Black Lives Matter"".  Black lives DO matter.  The 28 homicides in Baltimore between June 8, 2015 and July 8, 2015 were all Black people with ""Black Lives"".  There were 12 ""Black Lives"" lost in Chicago these first days of July.  Remember, today is only July 9th.  One a day plus three --- did their lives matter?The number of murders has surged by 103% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and 59% in Houston, Texas.

In New York murders have risen by 20%. In St Louis shootings are up 39%, robberies 43% and killings 25%. Last year 57 police officers were murdered, up from 27 in 2013.  Did their lives matter?

Police feel ham-stringed by the possibility of losing their lives and/or their livelihoods so they second-guess themselves or feel conflicted about responding, as  Lorraine Banks, 53, a city bus driver, said she did not blame the police for backing away. ""They can't do their job no more. Every day they know it could be their last and now they're being demonized just for doing that job.""

Maybe it is the impotence that plagues America which renders the once bold and adventurous in need of kicking statues or digging up dry old bones.  But let me say this, ""Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.""  We are all built the same as we have always been and we will travel down the bad old roads again.......  if we forget or attempt to rewrite or deface the artifacts that forged our country, we do no better than ISIS/ISIL .... you know the folks we often refer to as ""savages"".",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/867375950009864/?type=3,2015-07-09 23:29:57,80,26,88,80,0,0,0,0,0

1099 - First Crusade: 15,000 starving Christian soldiers march in religious procession around Jerusalem as its Muslim defenders look on.

Explanation:  Beginning in the 11th century, Christians in Jerusalem were increasingly persecuted by the city's Islamic rulers, especially when control of the holy city passed from the relatively tolerant Egyptians to the Seljuk Turks in 1071. Late in the century, Byzantine Emperor Alexius Comenus, also threatened by the Seljuk Turks, appealed to the West for aid. In 1095, Pope Urban II publicly called for a crusade to aid Eastern Christians and recover the holy lands. The response by Western Europeans was immediate.

The first crusaders were actually undisciplined hordes of French and German peasants who met with little success. One group, known as the ""People's Crusade,"" reached as far as Constantinople before being annihilated by the Turks. In 1096, the main crusading force, featuring some 4,000 mounted knights and 25,000 infantry, began to move east. Led by Raymond of Toulouse, Godfrey of Bouillon, Robert of Flanders, and Bohemond of Otranto, the army of Christian knights crossed into Asia Minor in 1097.

In June, the crusaders captured the Turkish-held city of Nicaea and then defeated a massive army of Seljuk Turks at Dorylaeum. From there, they marched on to Antioch, located on the Orontes River below Mount Silpius, and began a difficult six-month siege during which they repulsed several attacks by Turkish relief armies. Finally, early in the morning of June 3, 1098, Bohemond persuaded a Turkish traitor to open Antioch's Bridge Gate, and the knights poured into the city. In an orgy of killing, the Christians massacred thousands of enemy soldiers and citizens, and all but the city's fortified citadel was taken. Later in the month, a large Turkish army arrived to attempt to regain the city, but they too were defeated, and the Antioch citadel surrendered to the Europeans.

After resting and reorganizing for six months, the crusaders set off for their ultimate goal, Jerusalem. Their numbers were now reduced to some 1,200 cavalry and 12,000 foot soldiers. On June 7, 1099, the Christian army reached the holy city, and finding it heavily fortified, began building three enormous siege towers. By the night of July 13, the towers were complete, and the Christians began fighting their way across Jerusalem's walls. On July 14, Godfrey's men were the first to penetrate the defenses, and the Gate of Saint Stephen was opened. The rest of the knights and soldiers then poured in, the city was captured, and tens of thousands of its occupants were slaughtered.

The crusaders had achieved their aims, and Jerusalem was in Christian hands, but an Egyptian army marched on the holy city a few weeks later to challenge their claim. The Egyptians' defeat by the outnumbered Christians in August ended Muslim resistance to the Europeans for the time being, and five small Christian states were set up in the region under the rule of the leaders of the crusade.

A Tale of Two Graduates

Kevin Sutherland:

First Selectman Tim Herbst offered condolences to the family of Kevin Sutherland, who was killed in an apparent robbery attempt in Washington, D.C.

""Kevin was a bright and accomplished young man who had so much to offer. At 24, Kevin made a tremendous mark,"" Herbst said.

Sutherland, a Trumbull native, graduated from American University and at one time interned for U.S. Rep. Jim Himes. He got a job in the private sector at New Blue Interactive as a digital political strategist.

Sutherland said on his website, ""I am a millennial proudly living and working in our nation's capital. I'm passionate about politics and technology and have extensive skills in social media, graphic design, web design, video and photography. I'm driven to use these talents to effect political change and improve our world.""

He was active in student government while at American. Sasha Gilthorpe, the current president of the university's student government said in a statement:

Kevin Sutherland was truly the best of us. He was incredibly kind. He was utterly and completely devoted to his friends. He used his intelligence and his talents to be a champion for what he believed in. We are all better for knowing Kevin.

Jasper Spires:

Jasper Spires grew up in Northwest Washington and graduated in 2014 from Wilson High School. He attended Louisburg College, a private two-year Methodist school in North Carolina, where he majored in environmental engineering, according to an online school profile. The college said he was enrolled from the summer of 2014 through this past spring.

He is one of 12 or 13 siblings of multiple parentage.Jasper is described as a caring brother who would go out of his way to spend time with his siblings.  At least one of the siblings believe that the what happened on the fourth of July was ""irrational"".

Jasper Spires played football growing up, wanted to be a scientist and excelled in math. However, smart or talented or devoted he was, since turning 18 in September, Spires has had several run-ins with law enforcement. He was cited in May after police charged him with failing to pay a Metro fare in Silver Spring and was arrested the next month when police said he was lying on a bus bench for two hours outside the Bethesda Metro station and refused to move. 

Also, 4 days before the fourth of July......Spires was arrested Thursday night in Northwest Washington on more serious charges. A police report says he confronted a man outside shops in the 5200 block of Wisconsin Avenue NW in Friendship Heights. The victim told police that the man was waving a wine bottle and demanded, ""What do you have in your pockets?"" He then grabbed the man by the neck, pushed him against a wall and searched through his pockets, the report says.

He was arrested by police about five minutes later. According to a police report, he kicked two officers in the legs as they handcuffed him.

The police report indicates that officers forwarded to prosecutors charges of robbery by force and violence, a felony, and assault on a police officer, a misdemeanor. When Spires made his initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court on Friday, prosecutors downgraded the felony robbery charge to a misdemeanor simple assault. A judge released Spires pending a July 21 hearing and ordered him to stay away from the victim.

Everyone is now ""mystified""  as to why the U.S. attorney's office did not pursue the more serious charge. Perhaps they have been ""spooked"" by claims of the Prosecutor Mosby in the next city over and her promise to ""hear the cry"" of the ""persecuted"" Blacks....... maybe they don't want to show their ""superiority""....... maybe they did not want the crazy riots ......maybe they wanted to be ""sensitive"" to the plight of the young Black college student who needed the money more than the ""rich man""  ----- just a guess the ""rich guy"" was not Black.....  Maybe they just did not want the headache....

The Meeting of Kevin and Jasper:

Jasper Spires boarded the Red Line Metro train at Rhode Island Avenue shortly before 1 p.m. Saturday, joining passengers from the District and elsewhere headed to various Fourth of July festivities, among them the Foo Fighters concert at RFK Stadium.

As the train rumbled toward its next stop, at NoMa-Gallaudet, a three-minute ride, the 18-year-old Jasper Spires tried to grab a cellphone tucked into the waistband Kevin Sutherland. who was  headed to a gathering with friends.

On this crowded train, passengers cowered in fear for those few minutes and watched in fear ---- no-one helped the victim  as Spires punched 24-year-old Kevin Joseph Sutherland until he fell to the floor, then stabbed him until he was dead. Jasper was not satisfied with one stab wound, no .......court documents say that Kevin was cut or stabbed 30 or 40 times, in the chest, abdomen, back, side and arms. Police said the assailant then threw the victim's cellphone and returned to stomp on Sutherland's body.

It was never about the cellphone......  Rational people can not understand that.

One of the ""terrified"" bystanders stated:  ""We were in a moving train,"" said a 52-year-old woman, who spoke on the condition that she not be named because she is both a victim and a witness to a crime. ""You're not really sure what you need to do. . . . This man is holding a bloody knife. I don't think anyone was going to try and stop him.""

Nope, they were docile sheep....... waiting their turn..... and most importantly...... ""disarmed"" in one of the places in this country boasting strict gun laws.  That law does not extend to knives.

Jasper then proceeded to relieve some of the other ""fearful"" festivity goers of their wallets and money. One by one.

Jasper was the first person off the downtown-bound train car when it reached the station after the killing — and he took off his camouflage pants before jumping a turnstile. The arrest affidavit says that after clearing the fare meter, he dropped the pants and a black book bag, which a bystander picked up and held for police.

In the bag, according to the affidavit, was a washcloth with what was suspected to be blood and an AmeriHealth insurance card with Spires's name printed on it  (you should not leave home without it).  Police said they also found a small, black folding knife in a trash can.

Sooooo......A young, small,  5'4"" Black teenager of 18 with a small folding knife terrorized a train FULL of people, killed one man and robbed the fearful...... 

I am going to say this right now, this is not an issue of the blue team or the red team (Republican or Democrat)....... Kevin Sutherland and his family are proud and prominent Democrats..... his father having run for office recently in Connecticut.  And the advertising agency he worked for helped the campaigns of many elected Democrats.  

No, this is rather a people story, because whatever team you are on...... we bleed the same.  The politics of race is now so out of hand that the officials and his family are already trying to justify why this ""budding scientist, math genius, dedicated brother to 12, descendant of slaves and not to mention oppressed by ""white superiority"""" should kill, pillage and plunder.  Oh....... even before toxicology tests were done or came back...... they decided to blame it on ""synthetic drugs"" - jeeze, you can't make this idiocy up.  Or maybe it was the ""policeman's fault"" because they did not lock him up for the offense on Thursday.  

Whatever story they come up with........  you know that they are going to do their darn best to make sure he gets the strongest legal representation that the taxpayer's can buy for him.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/865962320151227/?type=3,2015-07-08 10:08:03,8,6,21,8,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_865723246841801,"Good Tuesday Evening!

Equal Protection is for Guys Too!

Emma Sulkowicz (born 1992) is the daughter of Sandra Leong and Kerry Sulkowicz, psychiatrists from Manhattan. She attended Dalton School on the Upper East Side, and in 2011 began her visual arts degree at Columbia University.

Emma alleges that she was anally raped and violently attacked in her dorm room by another student, on the first day of her second year in August 2012, during what began as a consensual sexual encounter.

University cleared him(Paul Nungesser), of responsibility.  But..... it was not over.

Emma Sulkowicz , purchased online from Tall Paul's Tall Mall, the 50-lb (23-kg), dark-blue, extra-long twin mattress is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, similar to the one on which Sulkowicz alleges she was raped. She then formulated during  the summer of 2014, the rules of engagement, which defined the parameters of the""mattress""  project. Written on the walls of her studio in the university's Watson Hall, these included that she had to carry the mattress when on university property; that it had to remain on campus when she was not there; and that she was not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help was offered she could accept.

In early September 2014, she began carrying the mattress on campus.She kept a diary throughout, amounting to 59,000 words at the end of the ""work"".

Sulkowicz said the work would end when the accused was expelled from or otherwise left Columbia, and that she would take the mattress to her graduation ceremony if necessary.

In the end she carried it to her (and the accused's) graduation day on May 19, 2015, despite a request from the school that students should not bring ""large objects which could interfere with the proceedings."" Several women helped carry the mattress on stage. As they approached, university president Lee Bollinger, who had been shaking other graduates' hands, turned away as if to pick something up, and did not shake their hands; the university said this happened only because the mattress was in the way. The next day posters appeared in Morningside Heights near the university calling Sulkowicz a ""pretty little liar.""

She is not pretty, at least because of this stunt, but definitely a liar.

So.......... whatever happened to the young man who, by the way did not receive ""free"" tuition for putting up with this torment?  His life became a nightmare.  His name was written on campus bathroom walls and distributed on flyers, and he was shunned by other students and subjected to threats.

The political class weighed in as well........ Hillary Clinton, the woman who wants to be President of the United States of America,  told the DNC Women's Leadership Forum in September 2014: ""That image should haunt all of us ...""  Then,  In October 2014,  Columbia students carried 28 mattresses on campus, one for each student who joined the federal Title IX complaint, then left them outside the university president's home; they were fined $471 for the clean-up.   A month later a group called ""Carry That Weight"" organized a ""National Day of Action to Carry That Weight,"" during which students carried mattresses on 130 US campuses and several elsewhere.   Sulkowicz received the National Organization for Women's Susan B. Anthony Award and the Feminist Majority Foundation's Ms. Wonder Award.

And wonder of all wonders! I In January 2015, New York Senator Kristin Gillibrand invited Sulkowicz to attend the 2015 State of the Union Address!!!

What an honor.... She became famous!!!!  But wait a minute!!!!!  He was innocent, she was a LIAR!.  Too Bad for Paul Nungesser.  You see, from one end to the other, and right to the halls of Congress and the State of the Union Address.......Sulkowicz's narrative went unchallenged amidst massive publicity.

So can this be some type of ""evolved"" rape case?  Not likely, simply a story of  ""a jilted love interest whose deep obsession with Nungesser transformed into a savage hatred.""  As the young man tried to escape the torment by spending time in Germany, Emma sent him more than a dozen messages along the lines of ""PAUL I MISS YOU PAUL I MISS YOU PAUL I MISS YOU PAULLL"" and ""I would LOVE to have you here – omg – we could snuggle.""  and finally, she begged him:  ""fuck me in the but,"" she said bluntly during one Facebook exchange.

Dear God in Heaven, what type of upbringing or hurt could have lead to this focused stalking?!??

Paul Nungesser, the man who was accused of raping recent Columbia graduate and tough-as-nails mattress carrier Emma Sulkowicz, is now going after the university for failing to protect him from Sulkowicz's ""gender based anti-male discriminatory harassment campaign.""

Nungesser's attorneys reason that the university has violated Title IX by ""condoning a hostile educational environment due to knowingly permitting and apparently approving"" of Sulkowicz's performance, thus ""denying him equal access to Defendant Columbia's resources and opportunities."" He argues that the university made no attempt to silence Sulkowicz after finding him ""not responsible"" for raping her, and in fact went ahead and featured her work on university property, and gave her ""special university privilege"" to carry her mattress to the school's graduation ceremony. 

 Nungesser maintains, and rightfully so,  that the mattress caused ""damages to physical well-being, emotional and psychological damages, damages to reputation, past and future economic losses, loss of educational and athletic opportunities, and loss of future career prospects. 

Meanwhile, having now graduated, Sulkowics has created an eight-minute porn video, titled ""Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol"" — French for ""This is Not a Rape"" — features Sulkowicz and an anonymized male actor having seemingly consensual sex in a dorm room. But the act soon turns violent as the actor chokes and slaps Sulkowicz, removes his condom and penetrates her against her will.

Her parents must be so proud.

But, there are bigger questions here.......  If this year long torment were committed by a man against a woman, would that not be called ""stalking""?  Also, if a woman pleads for a young man to notice her, to perform sex acts and so forth, is she not responsible for her words?  Finally, once the act is completed, does he (Nungesser) OWE it to Emma Sulkowicz  to eternally love her and cherish her obsession, which borders on criminal?  Obviously this young woman was ""helicoptered"", well educated and doted on from birth, did no one tell her along the way that she is not ""entitled"" to love and regard by any and everyone she targets?  People are not puppy-dogs or teddy-bears.

Columbia University dropped the ball and should be sued.....  The guy deserved equal protection and the girl deserved a lesson in life.

428053320608798_865597260187733,"Happy Birthday to:  Marc Zakharovich Chagall 

 Chagall  was a Russian-French artist.  Art critic Robert Hughes referred to Chagall as ""the quintessential Jewish artist of the twentieth century"" (though Chagall saw his work as ""not the dream of one people but of all humanity""). An early modernist, he was associated with several major artistic styles and created works in virtually every artistic medium, including painting, book illustrations, stained glass, stage sets, ceramic, tapestries and fine art prints.

According to art historian Michael J. Lewis, Chagall was considered to be ""the last survivor of the first generation of European modernists"". For decades, he ""had also been respected as the world's preeminent Jewish artist"". Using the medium of stained glass, he produced windows for the cathedrals of Reims and Metz, windows for the UN, and the Jerusalem Windows in Israel. He also did large-scale paintings, including part of the ceiling of the Paris Opéra.

Before World War I, he traveled between St. Petersburg, Paris, and Berlin. During this period he created his own mixture and style of modern art based on his idea of Eastern European Jewish folk culture. He spent the wartime years in Soviet Belarus, becoming one of the country's most distinguished artists and a member of the modernist avant-garde, founding the Vitebsk Arts College before leaving again for Paris in 1922.

He had two basic reputations, writes Lewis: as a pioneer of modernism and as a major Jewish artist. He experienced modernism's ""golden age"" in Paris, where ""he synthesized the art forms of Cubism, Symbolism, and Fauvism, and the influence of Fauvism gave rise to Surrealism"". Yet throughout these phases of his style ""he remained most emphatically a Jewish artist, whose work was one long dreamy reverie of life in his native village of Vitebsk.""  ""When Matisse dies,"" Pablo Picasso remarked in the 1950s, ""Chagall will be the only painter left who understands what color really is""  Wickipedia

 Born in Russia, Chagall moved to France in 1910 and became a prominent figure within the so-called Ecole de Paris. Later he spent time in the United States and the Middle East, travels which reaffirmed his self-image as an archetypal ""wandering Jew.""

Chagall enjoyed creating pieces that showed him and his wife, Bella Rosenfeld Chagall, flying around in the air. Over the Town is a celebration of their love and how they became unified as a couple once married.

""Over the Town shows Chagall and his wife flying above Vitebsk, which is a small town where he grew up. Chagall is holding his wife close as she waives one hand open through the air. The homes below them are all the same color, except for one red house in the background. There are also wooden fences present around most of the homes. The sky is more of a white than a blue and both people are wearing darker clothes to make them stand out among all the light colors"".http://totallyhistory.com/over-the-town/",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/865597260187733/?type=3,2015-07-07 14:13:52,12,0,2,12,0,0,0,0,0

The concept of what is a beautiful body has become so distorted in these ladies minds, that many suffer from the ""fashion model syndrome"", in which they desire bodies like Barbie dolls. This syndrome has ensured that women who are not slim are disfavoured even in jobs, giving the mentality that a girl's waist size matters more than brains. The highest rate of bulimia, anorexia and other eating disorders with adolescent girls in the world is in Medellín, Colombia. Otherwise known as the fashion capital of Latin America, there is a whopping 17.7 per cent of young girls suffering from eating disorders there.

As if being skinny is not enough, for many girls in Argentina, they desire to change their features and face structures as well. Whether it is to appear more beautiful or to make themselves younger, plastic surgery has become increasingly so common that it is almost a national hobby. - See more at: http://www.vidadelatinos.com/article/perception-beauty-latin-america#sthash.riPYSAyZ.dpuf",Perception of Beauty In Latin America,link,http://www.vidadelatinos.com/article/perception-beauty-latin-america#sthash.riPYSAyZ.dpuf,2015-07-06 13:55:34,7,8,0,7,0,0,0,0,0

He resonates.  He is ""The Donald"", and his light.... no matter what you think or believe, shines brighter than the rest.  He is a larger than life character......  You dare him to tell you how rich he is and then he says.....  ""I am rich.  I AM VERY RICH""  and then he shows you HOW rich.  Bling!  Yes, he is really rich.

Then the pundits, claim that ""he is not really running"" ---- one can almost envision their fingers crossed behind their backs.  Then, the companies weigh in......  ""Let's drop his products""........  Ah.... who wants to shop Macy's anyways....online is always better and there are sooooooo many other retailers, so I can get what I want from any of the others.  Probably better quality, anyways --- at Nordstroms or Neimans or Amazon.  I am not particular, except when companies do something I don't like.

Then the ""pundits"" angrily referred to him as the ""clown"", the ""side show""..... stating that he was going to ""ruin the debates"", it seemed taht they were saying ""Donald we want only your money, not you!!!!.  Not that he needs anyone to defend him because when he punches back.... he punches HARD...... with a precise uppercut.  

But, wait a minute......  what is happening here?  The truth is, he is not only resonating, he is defining the race and consequently having the multitudes not only come out from under the covers and define themselves, but also showing the public WHERE they are coming from.  Let me explain:

Trump releases a financial statement, along with his announcement.  Not much later Jeb Bush, not to be outdone, releases the past several decades of his tax returns..... (so THERE!).  

Then Candidate Trump says something about Mexican immigrants......  The pack of 15+ then race to the podiums across the United States to make sure that you know that ALL Mexican's come to the United States for L-O-V-E.  And through the penchant for L-O-V-E, their higher than regular ability to procreate with populate the country with little GOP's.(look it up, I could not make this up if I tried). The 15+ want you to know unequivocally that he is ""in-artful""  and ""Trump should apologize, or he risks isolating Hispanics"", and PLEASE don't think that they all think that way!!!!!  Because they are all searching for the presence of Mexican blood on Ancestor.com right now!!

Some people are even saying that the "" comments unleashed 'Latino Spring'"".  An unfortunate reference considering the lack of success of the ""Arab Spring"", but people, especially some journalists don't read.

First of all, let me say that the rush to love on Mexicans because of the comments is in and of itself RACIST.  Sorry, Hispanics don't like to be ""lumped"" together as ""one"" no more than any other ""group"".  In other words, the people that Trump referenced do NOT represent ALL SPANISH SPEAKING PEOPLE.  

The article Trump referred to, regarding rape, was authored by a LEFT LEANING website by the name of Fusion.  I visit the site regularly to take a look at what in a number of situations have been an unvarnished look at the immigration problem........   the exact verbiage is:

Before they can reach the American Dream, many migrant women have to survive a Mexican nightmare. A staggering 80 percent of Central American girls and women crossing Mexico en route to the United States are raped along the way, according to directors of migrant shelters interviewed by Fusion.

That's up from previous reports by non-profit organizations like Amnesty International that estimate the number at 60 percent.

""Women and girl migrants, especially those without legal status traveling in remote areas or on trains, are at heightened risk of sexual violence at the hands of criminal gangs, people traffickers, other migrants or corrupt officials,"" the 2010 Amnesty International report stated. ""…Many criminal gangs appear to use sexual violence as part of the ""price"" demanded of migrants. According to some experts, the prevalence of rape is such that people smugglers may require women to have a contraceptive injection prior to the journey as a precaution…""

Say it ain't so.... Angela......  but yes ...... it is. Definitely real.http://fusion.net/story/17321/is-rape-the-price-to-pay-for-migrant-women-chasing-the-american-dream/

And what about that sweet, picturesque,  little town, TENANCINGO, TLAXCALA ? — In this small Mexican town that sends sex slaves to New York, little boys dream of growing up to be pimps.
http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/small-town-tenancingo-mexico-city-source-new-york-sex-slaves-article-1.1088866

And finally, what about the case of  Francisco Sanchez, a seven-time convicted felon who has been accused of fatally shooting a woman on a San Francisco pier, has admitted to committing the crime and going to San Francisco because of its sanctuary law?

Oh yeah, they are trying to turn that ""little peccadillo"" into a question of ""how did he get the gun?""........  As if he would make sure that he had ""legal"" rights to get a gun..... after all he ONLY committed 7 felonies prior.......  Can't hold a guy back for those little things..... right?

I think that those who knee jerked this one will live to regret it.  Anytime the pack runs in one direction too quickly and the tsunami is not coming your way, you should question the direction.  The American people are not going to vote for one of ""the pack"".... not this time......  and they didn't the last time either.  Remember, they got the ""first Black President"" last  (2) times, and they are looking for another ""first"".........  maybe this ""first"" will be bold, strong, and non-politicized, because the ""other"" option will be either the ""first"" woman or the ""first"" socialist.

""The Donald"" is a force to be reckoned with.  He is his own man, beholden to no one.......  he kind of guy that used to represent American men.

Internet Anger, Politics and the Kids

First and foremost I am going to make a disclaimer: Children should be free to be anything that they want and say whatever they want. However, one must realize that the changes between the ages of 10 and 18 in ANY kid's life are tremendous. That being said, I don't think (remember this is MY opinion) that ANY kid should be held up as an icon of any side of the political arena. This is especially true in our era of the extended ""childhood"" of angry 30, 40 and 50 year old ""teenagers"" who will get online, troll for victims and target these children with vile obscene messages and death threats.

Although these iconic precocious youngsters (the bloggers and You-tubers) are often well spoken and cute as a ""bug"", they are real human beings who have no idea that the troll to their site might be simply a maladjusted person with serious issues of isolation, rejection and defeat. For example, there have been times that I have opened my blog to find pictures of fairly under-developed penises, total ""cuss-outs"", and threats from people who have neither read nor digested the content but object to my opinion outright because someone else told them what I wrote or they just know it was ""what I meant"". They have threatened to ""shag"" me and worse......The shag, however, - that is pretty scary since I actually DID have a shag haircut when I was a teenager and because I have ""natural"" hair, the thickness made me look like Lincoln, our neighbor's standard poodle. Now that IS scary (smile).

But, let's go on.......... C.J. Pearson, the 12-year-old black conservative who has been a vocal online critic of President Barack Obama is receiving support from his fans after leaving social media amid reported threats. The team that manages Pearson's Facebook account posted screen grabs from Twitter of comments directed at Pearson on Thursday by a user with the handle @MonaB2010 (Mona Hussein Obama.) http://www.newsmax.com/…/pearson-boy…/2015/07/05/id/653561/…

The vile ""Mona"" goes on to say: ""If you're not the an [sic] official GOP, then they need to denounce u. Otherwise we go for the lawsuit,"" the person tweeted, followed by ""pooh no sorry your fam has been bowing down to white ppl. So it's the rest that need to be killed"" and ""Wish we could switch Trayvon's life for yours.""
She/he ended with, ""you don't need to copy me to all your little racist noise machine feeds. I'll see you in court. Will file Tuesday.""
Understandably, the exchange frightened C.J. Certain threats have a chilling effect on children ------ death, lawsuits and the possibility of harm to their parents are probably three of the ""hot buttons"".

So what was the outcome? He has been silenced by old Mona, who is probably a lonely 45 year old ""shut in"" lurking in Momma's basement until the night shift at the convenience store.
Instead of writing, speaking or daring to think differently...... he has been silenced by the nefarious screed of a sick human. C.J.'s sad reply: ""After much thought and consideration, I've decided to take a break from politics and political commentary. I had a horribly rough night on Twitter after a woman not only threatened to sue me for expressing my opinions but threatened my family,"" he said. ""At this point, I've decided that it's best for me to take a step back and evaluate all of my options before continuing down this path.""

A voice lost and silenced in this vague, anonymous cyber-attack age. Pearson's conversation with @MonaB2010 began after he criticized actor George Takei's attack on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' same-sex marriage dissent. Takei called Thomas a ""clown in blackface.""
What is the message here? It is OK for George Takei or anyone to attack a conservative but, man-oh-man, if you are Black and a conservative AND you are not on the Obama bandwagon....... we can kill your future and your family. ""You, my boy are not free."" The First Amendment is not a ""right"" for you.....Had this been a conservative making these comments, the Justice department would have been called in to find that person and arrest them for hate crimes since the threats were made against a black kid.
For her part, @MonaB2010 claims on her Twitter profile that she has been attacked by ""RWNJs"" (Right-wing nut jobs) and that ""Black Twitter"" has supported her.

I bet.

But going back to the ""precocious kid"" idea and the need to a bit cautious about putting children in this ""limelight"". Let us remember Jonathan Krohn, the adorable cherub who headlined the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) convention of 2009, wrote a book on conservatism which was released in 2010. He ""wooed"" the conservative crowd and had them, not to mention, a number of journalists at his feet. Several Facebook fan pages were started for him, including one called ""Jonathan Krohn 2032"", a reference to the first year he will be eligible to run for President of the United States.

After the conference, Krohn's parents received hate mail accusing them of brainwashing their son, but both insist Krohn developed his own political thinking.

Krohn attended the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference, but did not have a speaking role. By 2012, he confirmed to Politico that he no longer considers himself a conservative, and in fact takes a liberal point of view on many issues, including same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act. He also said that if he were old enough to vote in the 2012 presidential election, he would vote for Barack Obama.
In 2012, his interview with Huffington Post, indicated that he felt that his NOW conservative critics (because of his shift) were ""scorned right-wingers showing all the maturity of a little boy."" AND..... ""the right's idea of political discourse is increasingly becoming a battle between ""drunken college boys fighting over which one of their fraternities is cooler"" who have the ""maturity of schoolyard bullies"".

Finally, typical of a 17 year old boy, he admitted that one of his goals was to date a woman with ""cans the size of my head,""
A little crude, but pretty age appropriate. Politics and threats from stupid people can come later. We should ALL lay-off these kids.... they are not small adults and they are DEFINITELY NOT, a soothsayer or oracle of political thought.

1854 - In Jackson, MI, the Republican Party held its first convention. (From History Today)

The Republican Party was founded on July 6th, 1854.
The party was born of opposition to slavery. In 1820, the US Congress had agreed the Missouri Compromise, under which Missouri entered the Union as a slave state, but slavery was forbidden anywhere else in the Louisiana Purchase north of 36º 30'. 

In 1854 the principle was threatened by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, under which the white inhabitants of the two territories were to decide by referendum whether slavery would be allowed there or not. There were numerous Americans in the northern states who disapproved of slavery, including many northern Whigs and Democrats as well as the Free Soilers, who had sprung from concern over the possible introduction of slavery in territory acquired from Mexico in the 1840s. With the slogan 'Free soil, free speech, free labor and free men', the Free Soil Party had run Martin Van Buren unsuccessfully for president in 1848.

Free Soilers now joined Whigs and northern Democrats to form a new, completely northern political party. The original impetus came from impromptu 'anti-Nebraska' meetings in the north-western states of Wisconsin and Michigan to discuss what to do if the Kansas-Nebraska Act passed. The meetings were not only opposed to slavery, but demanded the opening up of the West by small homesteaders and the building of railroads. In February a gathering in Ripon, Wisconsin, resolved to form a new party and a local lawyer named Alvan E. Bovay suggested the name Republican for its echoes of Thomas Jefferson. In Michigan there were meetings in Kalamazoo, Jackson and Detroit, and after the Act had passed in May, the new party was formally founded in Jackson in July. A leading figure was Austin Blair, a Free Soiler lawyer who was prosecuting attorney of Jackson County. He helped to draft the new party's platform, was elected to the state senate in Republican colours that year and would become governor of Michigan in 1860. - See more at: http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/republican-party-founded#sthash.JMnJSKHW.dpuf

In Illinois meanwhile, another lawyer, a Whig named Abraham Lincoln, had come out against slavery and the Kansas-Nebraska Act. In a speech at Peoria in October 1854 he said: 'No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent.' He proclaimed that slavery was 'a monstrous injustice' and a breach of the Declaration of Independence and for a time he favoured transporting ex-slaves back to Africa. The new party quickly spread to the other northern states, where it displaced the Whigs as the principal opposition to the Democrats.   

Slavery was not the only issue. Northerners often looked down on blacks, but dislike of slavery was part of belief in a United States in which every man was free to make himself a good life by his own efforts. Already in the 1854 elections the Republicans gained a majority in the House of Representatives. Two years later the party ran its first presidential candidate, the celebrated western explorer John C. Fremont, who carried eleven states. The 1860 party convention in Chicago chose Lincoln as its candidate with Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, a former Democrat, as his running mate. The northern and southern wings of the Democratic Party ran rival candidates, which let the Republicans in with the electoral votes of all the northern states. From then until 1932, of seventeen presidential elections the Republicans lost only four, two each to Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson. No new political party has won an American presidential election since 1860. - See more at: http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/republican-party-founded#sthash.JMnJSKHW.dpuf

Between 1824-1924, the Democratic Party nominated one blatant racist after another. The southern wing was able to exercise veto power–2/3's needed to nominate back then. In 1928, Al Smith (a Catholic) was nominated over southern objections. Between 1932-1944, FDR was heavily beholden unto the southern wing (1) for getting him nominated and (2) they controlled most of the congressional committees/subcommittees, but he opened the White House via the redoubtable Eleanor Roosevelt & blacks started voting Democratic in a big way by 1934.

In 1948, Truman desegregated the Armed Services by executive order, was renominated over near unanimous opposition from the south, and delivered a speech to an all black audience in Harlem (no president had ever done that before). In 1963-65, LBJ used his formidable powers of persuasion to convince congress to not only pass 2 land-mark bills, but shut off debate in the Senate. 

Note:  The founder of the Democratic Party, Andrew Jackson, if judged by today's standards would be less than a ""gentleman"". He was a slave owner (as was most of the moneyed class in those days) and began the forced relocation of the native Americans known as the ""Trail of Tears.""  Once again we must view history through the prism of its own time, not ours.

Althea Gibson

Althea Gibson (August 25, 1927 – September 28, 2003) was an American tennis player and professional golfer, and the first black athlete to cross the color line of international tennis. In 1956, she became the first person of color to win a Grand Slam title (the French Open). The following year she won both Wimbledon and the U.S. Nationals (precursor of the U.S. Open), then won both again in 1958, and was voted Female Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press in both years. In all, she won 11 Grand Slam tournaments, including six doubles titles, and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame. ""She is one of the greatest players who ever lived,"" said Robert Ryland, a tennis contemporary and former coach of Venus and Serena Williams. ""Martina couldn't touch her. I think she'd beat the Williams sisters.""[1] In the early 1960s she also became the first black player to compete on the women's professional golf tour.

At a time when racism and prejudice were widespread in sports and in society, Gibson was often compared to Jackie Robinson. ""Her road to success was a challenging one,"" said Billie Jean King, ""but I never saw her back down."" ""To anyone, she was an inspiration, because of what she was able to do at a time when it was enormously difficult to play tennis at all if you were black,"" said former New York City Mayor David Dinkins. ""I am honored to have followed in such great footsteps,"" wrote Venus Williams. ""Her accomplishments set the stage for my success, and through players like myself and Serena and many others to come, her legacy will live on.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/864907043590088/?type=3,2015-07-06 06:27:18,38,4,4,38,0,0,0,0,0

Abigail Fisher, the Supreme Court, and Affirmative Action

The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear in next term a major affirmative action case concerning a program at a public university that takes race into consideration as one factor for admissions.  This decision marks the second time the Court has agreed to hear a challenge from Ms. Fisher, challenging the admissions policies at the University of Texas at Austin.

Abigail Noel Fisher and Rachel Multer Michalewicz applied to the University of Texas at Austin in 2008 and were denied admission. The two women, both white, filed suit, alleging that the University had discriminated against them on the basis of their race in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The University of Texas at Austin accepts students in the top 10% of each Texas high school's graduating class, regardless of their race; under Texas House Bill 588, 81% of 2008's freshman class were admitted under the plan.

Applicants who, like Fisher, fail to graduate in the top 10% of their high schools, can still gain admission by scoring highly in a process which evaluates their talents, leadership qualities, family circumstances, and race.  Fisher had a grade point average of 3.59 (adjusted to 4.0 scale) and was in the top 12% of her class at Stephen F. Austin High School. She scored 1180 on her SAT (measured on the old 1600-point scale, because UT Austin did not consider the writing section in its undergraduate admissions decision for the 2008 incoming freshman class). The 25th and 75th percentiles of the incoming class at UT-Austin were 1120 and 1370. She was involved in the orchestra and math competitions and volunteered at Habitat for Humanity.  Wikipedia

During the case proceedings, Fisher enrolled at Louisiana State University, where she was in her final year as an undergraduate in 2012. In 2011, Michalewicz withdrew from the case, leaving Fisher as the sole plaintiff. Wikipedia

I am going to state, first and foremost, that by today's standards Ms. Fisher's scores and GPA are not as competitive as they could be, at least not to get automatic admission into UT Austin - often thought of as the ""top"" university in Texas. This is just a fact, her scores were not competitive.

The case was on the Supreme Court calendar for the term beginning in October 2012. There were concerns that if the Court overruled Grutter, affirmative action at public universities would end in the United States. It should.  Some argued that the result of such a ruling would decrease the number of black and Hispanic students admitted to American universities while increasing the proportion of white and Asian students. 

During the beginning of the petitioner's argument, Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg asked questions about whether the case was moot. Specifically, they were concerned with the university's arguments that Fisher would not have earned admission regardless of her race (she probably would not), that she had already graduated from college, and that she only named the $100 application fee as real damages. Scalia commented that the harm of racial discrimination alone created an active controversy under the Court's previous Equal Protection jurisprudence.

Justices Scalia, Alito, and Roberts asked many questions about the definition of a ""critical mass"", which Grutter named as the central measure of diversity. Scalia started calling it a ""critical cloud"" after the university's lawyer failed, upon multiple requests, to define the central measure of diversity. Chief Justice Roberts asked whether an applicant who was one-quarter or one-eighth Latino would be permitted by the University to check the ""Latino"" box. Garre responded that the applicant was entitled to self-identify as any race, subject to discipline under the university's honor code, and that the University did not ever question that determination.

We now wade deeper into the murky waters of race, preference and ""self identification"".  The truth of this matter is simply that race based ANYTHING in regards to acceptance into a university should be abolished.  Children are bombarded with low or high expectations of their abilities from the day that they enter school.  This expectation of ""smartness"" or ""mediocrity"" or lower than that is reinforced by lowering the standards for some races and making the bar high for another.  Children will live ""up"" or ""down"" to these standards.  Students and civil rights activists are still asking Florida, for example,  to hold black and Hispanic students to a higher standard or at least to the same stand as their white and Asian counterparts.

So......  what are these standards and are school systems practicing this form of discrimination

According to the standards in Florida, Asian students should be the smartest, and teachers will expect the least from blacks. The Board of Education has agreed to pass a revised plan that outlines new academic goals for students based on race.

Under the Florida plan,90 percent of Asian students, 88 percent of whites, 81 percent of Hispanics and 74 percent of blacks will be expected to read at or above their applicable reading grade levels in future tests. For math scores, they expect 92 percent of Asians, 80 percent of Hispanics and 74 percent of blacks to excel, suggesting that some races warrant a lower bar than others.

So, now some would say, Angela, don't you want it to be a little ""easier"" for Black kids?  

No, I do not.  Furthermore, I don't believe that any child is inherently lacking in intelligence, talent or drive simply as a result of race.  And what about the 15%+ who are bi-racial or the many multi-racial children?  Either we have to hanker for the old Jim Crow segregation ""one drop"" rule which states that  a black is any person with any known African black ancestry, in other words, a single drop of ""black blood"" makes a person a black, or we declare one side (maybe the left) Black and the other (maybe the right) white, or we allow people to self identify, as in the case of Rachel Dolezal........ remember her?  A great deal of people spent a good amount of time pounding their fingernails on the keys to insult me or ""unfriend"" me regarding Ms. Dolezal.  This is where I was leading you, the universities and schools will not challenge your ""self identification""  for fear of being ""non-PC"" or taken to court.  But I digress.

Bottom line, for those concerned with ""fairness"", to either heap accolades on those of one race or denigrate others based on the age-old intellectual determination of inferiority of another race implies bigotry.  The assumption that one race is inherently smarter and thus NOT in need of ""affirmative action"" implies ""superiority"". Conversely, to make  a NATIONAL assumption that less should be expected of another race is simply put, the soft bigotry of lowered expectations.  And surprisingly, this may make us feel good about ourselves (the benevolent grantors), but it also implies a level of superiority to those granting the ""affirmative action"" policy.  

Bottom line, we sink or swim based upon factors that make race ultimately a benign factor in the mix -- or at least it should be.  When we lower the expectations based upon race, that young brilliant child who happens to be Black that his race determines how intelligent he is and thus what will be expected of him.  In addition, he will ultimately deliver less.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/861711253909667/?type=3,2015-06-30 08:23:15,12,1,21,12,0,0,0,0,0

When I attended the second fourth grade, we would line up every morning to show off our outfits.  One girl, I will call her Voncia.... primarily because that is her name would walk from one to the next and declare whether she though we were wearing a"" pretty"" or ""ugly"" outfit or dress......  After the 3rd time she told me I was wearing something ugly.....  I went home crying (I spent every morning ironing my clothes until they were as stiff as buckram cloth so this was disappointing) and my Mum asked me what Voncia was wearing and who died and made HER  the boss of everybody, and she said everyone has a mouth and a nose.  Sometimes the same ""junk"" will come out of both, ""just forget it"" (My Dad would have been a bit more colorful in his descriptions, but I digress (smile).  That was it.  She did not call the principle to complain of ""bullying"" and I did not wilt.  One sentence and I still iron my clothes stiff, because I like it that way but Voncia and other people like her have never been THAT important to me again.  

That is how we build resiliency, and that is how we stand up to bullies in the 4th grade and when we are 40.

428053320608798_861047420642717,"Good Sunday Evening!

The Battle for Real Estate and the Sale of the ""Bill of Goods""

First and foremost, so that I am not ever accused of ""stealing"" intellectual property, this was one of the themes of the sermon at a very large church I attended in Dallas this morning.  Any good sermon will deliver a message that will inspire you to think about how it relates to your life and to things that you, yourself, are experiencing or have experienced in the past.  The idea is that we have experienced and learned so many things that have been stored in our minds, our psyche, that we are not aware of or though long forgotten.  It is incomprehensible how much the messages that we have conveyed TO us affect us continually as as to have an effect on our lives.  

To break this down even further, I am going to speak to what I taught my own students about the concept of ""marketing"".  In every aspect of our lives we are being sold something.  In some cases this some thing might amount to as being ""sold a bill of goods"".  We know that this idiom means  simply that we have been deceived or taken unfair advantage of,  

What does this mean and what have we been sold?    It simply means that we have allowed the liberal media and their operatives to swindle us out of our heritage, out of our collective culture and out of the truth.  When they bathed the White house in the Rainbow colors of Gay rights, understand that they have never used any such symbolism to show deference to our policemen and women who continuously lose their lives to protect us.  They are selling ""happiness"" and ""love"" that will be used to belittle the religious beliefs of others.  Because if you don't like it, you must be a bigot......  a hater......  and this will be enough for you to be destroyed.

We have ceded any and all symbolism to the censure mob.  We have given up!  My God, if you believe that the flag you wave stands for something other than what someone else says it does.....  STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.    I might not agree, however, you have every right as a person and a citizen to voice your descent.  A mad 21 year old misfit does the unthinkable and the politicians immediately take to the airwaves to extol the prevalence of the KKK, white supremacy and the Confederate flag - even when he(the crazy boy) said it was not a presence in South Carolina (read his mad world missive).  Bullies never give up, they twist your words, they gather gangs to beat you back, they never let a good tragedy go to waste and if you have to stand as David, in front of Goliath...... what good company you are in. 

Believe me, it does not stop at the Confederate Flag, the American Flag is next as well as as the picture on the one dollar bill --- George Washington..  is next.  let me explain:  When George Washington's father Augustine died in 1743, George Washington became a slave owner at the early age of eleven. In his will, Augustine left his son the 280 acre family farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia. In addition, Washington was willed ten slaves..   At the time of Washington's death, the Mount Vernon enslaved population consisted of 318 people.  We have to look at history through the prism of time.  NOT our times, HISTORICAL times.  But the ""bum rush"" is to vilify the history of the nation and conveniently define it in today's terms.  By the way....... some of the same people who wish to tear apart the founding fathers resent the idea that you should repeat some of the things they said just 10 years ago...... because they have ""evolved.""  How convenient that we are to ""forget"" Al Sharpton antisemitism and the President's non-acceptance of gay marriage......  they can ""evolve"".  The rest of the world is ""stuck"" with being crucified.

In addition, we enter some churches today and nowhere, not on the walls, not in the literature, not under the chairs, not on the stairs..... not anywhere.... will you see a Cross.  The omission Cross is a denial of the Life of our Father, it is ceding the symbolism to popularity......  ""For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?""  Sure, you will fill the pews, BUT, is the pastor claiming to be the God and he in turn, the author of the Truth?  Is Jesus not cool because he did not work out and possess big arm ""guns""? Cause he just worked with wood or something instead of being a lawyer?  Why are we ashamed..... of our Salvation...... of our Heritage....

 In ways that can NEVER be denied,   Man or (Wo)man is fickle.  We live with our eyes on today... and thankfully our days and thus our possibility to ""mess it all up"", are numbered.  As represented by the fact that our days are numbered, we live to satisfy the ""id""..... The ""id"" is based on our pleasure principle. In other words, the id wants whatever feels good at the time, with no consideration for the reality of the situation.  YOLO (you only live once) is representative of the ""pleasure principle"".  We are in no way capable of foreseeing the true consequences of our wanton actions such as drug abuse, indiscriminate sexual activities,  children out of wedlock, irresponsibility and corruption of our children.  I don't care if you have the mantle of Pope, minister or imam.....  these are men or women.  All may be ""smart"", erudite, or just simply ""fabulous""..... but they are still human and posses all human frailties, complaints and problems.

Finally, we have ceded out common sense and decency. I am ashamed that I had to tell my daughter that in order to pass the AP examination, just mark the answer that indicates that indicates that women are always discriminated against, Blacks and Hispanics are exploited and the pervading majority culture is exploiting.... everyone.  Because even if you know the correct answer, that is not what they(the teachers) are looking for.  The ""right"" answer is not wanted.... someone has to be victimized by someone else ..... and that ""mean victimizing someone"" else is almost always white and especially a white male.  As one educator website stated:   ""The voyages of Christopher Columbus provide unlimited teaching opportunities -- opportunities that can be pursued without glorifying the man or denigrating his achievements.  No sense in ""glorifying"" ole ""Chris""  when in 1998, Honduran Indians held a mock trial, in which Columbus was found guilty of the charges of ""genocide and robbery resulting from the 1492 beginnings of the colonization of the Americas.  The Honduran Indians are exploited as well....  So it encourages the teacher to discuss the diet of Christopher Columbus to show he liked to foods of different cultures or some nonsense.  Any candidate for President  supporting Common Core should be queried extensively.  This  NOT just about ""standards"", it is about indoctrination... and the expansion of real estate and the sale of that ""bill of goods"".  

Pay attention, the precious real estate I speak of is our minds, our kids minds, and their hearts.

428053320608798_858669900880469,"""Bump all the chumps"" and not the ones you think....

Two students in particular at the University of Texas at Austin are managing  to voice their desire to remove the statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis on campus. The statue was recently spray-painted with the tags, ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Bump ALL The Chumps.""

Xavier Rotnofsky and Rohit Mandalapu,  filed a resolution to Student Government on Friday that would support the removal of the Jefferson Davis statue on campus.

Rotnofsky and Mandalapu are both students and The University of Texas at Austin and editors for the school's satire magazine, The Texas Travesty. What started off as humorous stunt ended with them winning the offices of president and vice-president, respectively, for the 2015-2016 school year.

Their platform included a promise to reduce the hours of campus study centers so students can spend less time studying and more time partying, in addition to more serious planks like addressing school diversity and getting rid of the Jefferson Davis status on campus.

""We thought that the school was in need of two good boys,"" Mandalapu says. ""People like satire. It's a fresh and funny to look at something that clearly has issues. We just pointed (the issues) out and people started getting on board.""
The statue's presence on campus has sparked controversy in the past because of Davis' status as a Confederate leader. Last weekend, the statue was temporarily defaced with the word ""CHUMP"" written on the statue's base in blue chalk.   

""Whereas, Jefferson Davis argued vociferously that the institutions of American slavery were beneficial; and ... whereas, The University of Texas at Austin as a public institution of the State of Texas that represents a diverse student population should not condone or promote Jefferson Davis' values that are offensive to the student body … be it further resolved, the University of Texas at Austin Student Government fully endorses the removal of the Jefferson Davis statue from campus,"" the resolution read.  

Rotnofsky and Mandalapu, who wrote the resolution with Chris Gilman, editor-in-chief of the Texas Travesty, and Plan II senior Ciaran Dean-Jones, also cited historical precedent for altering campus symbols that ""do not align with the values and ideals of the student body.""

This is not the first time the statue has been vandalized. On May 10, 2015, the phrases ""Davis Must Fall"" and ""Emancipate UT"" were scrawled on the statue.

So, the ""jokesters"" or ""pranksters"" or ""funny boys"" as they like to call themselves have won..... or might well win the battle to turn a university with a disdain for history and the desire to turn into a Politically Correct Comedy Review or ...into the modern version of 1984 where all of the historical facts are revised to reflect the vision of one.  

American colleges are such bastions of intellectual thought, filled with intellectual curiosity and celebrated for their free flowing exchange of ideas and opinions. I managed to type that sentence with a straight face (smile).

Is Chivalry Dead?

Every morning I go downstairs, make a cup of coffee and start flipping through the news.  I begin first with the business section, making notes for the day, then on to the headlines to pick up on whatever is going on t=in the world, and then on to the matters of Faith before heading out to walk.  These items will dictate whether or not I bring my iPhone which is loaded with my walking music.  Yesterday, I needed no music.

Te headlines on one article read:  ""Billy Graham's grandson steps down from Florida megachurch after admitting an affair"".  Quite a shocker, but not entirely unexpected.  I attended Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church several times and enjoyed their yearly Christmas pageant when Dr. Kennedy was alive.  We had several friends who were loyal congregants and  one gentleman in particular who was extremely close to Allen.  At the height of its popularity, the service was viewed by millions and it was very influential in conservative politics.  One problem, no successor was groomed and after Dr. Kennedy passed away, the church began to decline.  Then a new pastor was brought in, his name is Tullian Tchividjian.

At the time Pastor Tchividjian. was in his middle thirties and had different ideas in regards to how the worship and church style would proceed.  As you can imagine, without the details, that this did not go over very well and roughly half of the church left.  What was Coral Ridge Presbyterian, with its formal service ( I liked it very much)  and its political involvement...... was over.  Contemporary music and service for a contemporary preacher.  

One problem, contemporary style does not dictate contemporary values.   ""Tullian Tchividjian's affair has surprised the Christian world, especially after the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church pastor voluntarily stepped down. In announcing this decision, Tullian also said that his wife, Kim Tchividjian, also committed adultery by cheating with another man, but she has since distanced herself from the statement released by the Florida megachurch pastor.""

In other words, Pastor Tullian Tchividjian ""outed"" his wife's affair in his statement of resignation and in doing so he suggested that his ""modern day Eve"" aka his wife Kim's cheating caused him to go astray.  Instead of the proverbial apple, Pastor Tullian Tchividjian bit into the ""apple of adultery"".    His exact words were:

""I resigned from my position at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church today due to ongoing marital issues. As many of you know, I returned from a trip a few months back and discovered that my wife was having an affair. Heartbroken and devastated, I informed our church leadership and requested a sabbatical to focus exclusively on my marriage and family. As her affair continued, we separated. Sadly and embarrassingly, I subsequently sought comfort in a friend and developed an inappropriate relationship myself. Last week I was approached by our church leaders and they asked me about my own affair. I admitted to it and it was decided that the best course of action would be for me to resign. Both my wife and I are heartbroken over our actions and we ask you to pray for us and our family that God would give us the grace we need to weather this heart wrenching storm. We are amazingly grateful for the team of men and women who are committed to walking this difficult path with us. Please pray for the healing of deep wounds and we kindly ask that you respect our privacy.""

Hmmmm...... he wants privacy, however, he was not willing to allow his wife to have HER privacy.  Whatever happened to understanding that even if it were true, one can not control the lives of others..... even our own spouses, children and significant others.  Whatever happened to the chivalrous ""Quiet Man"" who would only speak of his own failings, take responsibility and keep quiet about the failings of others .... especially his wife who is also the mother of his children?  

Some of you will say Angela, isn't there something more important to talk about this morning like the Confederate Flag, or this killing or that killing or the weather or ......... 

The answer:  No.....  you see this took a while to get into my ""noggin"" and to realize why this ""bugged"" me so much.  This man, Pastor Tullian Tchividjian, led a ""flock"" of 1700 by recent accounts.  When we lead through any journey, we often have a navigation system or directions or at least a compass.  It appears that Pastor Tullian Tchividjian had neither of the first two aforementioned apparatus and his ""moral"" compass did not have a working pointer.  

This is similar in many ways to the leadership today.  Lying is OK as long as it is a ""little lie"" (not true since the cover-up of a little one makes it bigger) and the team is ""our team"" and everything turns out in the end.......   Right?   It is okay for the President of the United States to do certain things and say certain things because he is Black, so the usage of the word ""nigger"" is fine...... on the radio or the podcast. ..... Right?   Many people have claimed that he is the first President to use such language, I am telling you that he is not.  The term, however has an infamous president:  in ""Lone Star Rising: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1908-1960"", by Robert Dallek. Johnson defended the Supreme Court appointment of the famous Thurgood Marshall, rather than a black judge less identified with the civil rights cause, by saying to a staff member, ""Son, when I appoint a n-----r to the court, I want everyone to know he's a n-----r."".  

So, back to the original question...... Is chivalry dead?......  well lets first define chivalry: "" The combination of qualities expected of a leader, especially courage, honor, courtesy, justice, and a readiness to help the weak"".  This behavior, similar to the clothing we wear, is what sets the stage for a civil and respectful congregation, nation, family and life.  It is different when the reporter, friend or guy on the street does certain things but decorum is expected when one is in office or the leader of an organization......  Or am I ""out to lunch"" on this one?

Now you can answer the question yourself......  Is Chivalry dead?""

A Strange Alliance

I am always a very curious person.  In the past few days I have watched endorsements of the Pope's edict on climate change endorsed by atheists, green party leaders, and Bill Maher while being denounced by the very people who he should appeal to..... some very devout Catholics and other religious figures.

Pope Frances, while recognizing that factors, from volcanic eruptions to changes in the earth's axis, might be at work,  ""many scientific studies"" have identified human activity, and the resulting concentration of carbon in the atmosphere, as the main factor.  In his report of over 190 pages he cites   philosophers like Thomas Aquinas and Catholic sources and the Judeo-Christian scripture on the religious side and ""reference to the environmental ideas of Patriarch Bartholomew I, the Orthodox leader who has pioneered green theology, as well as the thinking of non-Christian religions and secular ideas about the planet. "" http://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2015/06/pope-and-climate-change

The pope issued a lengthy message on the subject [of climate change] to the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, give an address to the UN general assembly and call a summit of the world's main religions.  Why?  It is the pope's wish to ""directly influence next year's crucial UN climate meeting in Paris, when countries will try to conclude 20 years of fraught negotiations with a universal commitment to reduce emissions.""

He is urging all Catholics to take action on moral and scientific grounds, the document will be sent to the world's 5,000 Catholic bishops and 400,000 priests, who will distribute it to parishioners.

In America, this will probably float as high as a lead balloon.  And  It is likely to attract resistance from Vatican conservatives and in rightwing church circles, particularly in the US – where Catholic climate sceptics also include John Boehner, Republican leader of the House of Representatives and Rick Santorum, the former Republican presidential candidate.

Other challenges exist as well......  Pope Francis' biggest challenge could be convincing ordinary people that climate change is a moral issue. Less than 10% of Americans now believe so, according to a poll conducted by Yale University and George Mason University.

You don't have to be Catholic to admire his compassion for the poor and downtrodden. But his contempt for capitalism and anything resembling free markets seems pretty un-religious And he makes himself easy to deride when he complains the Earth ""is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.""  

While the tone might appeal to left leaning people as well as the non-religious, they are not about to convert.   He decries the reliance on fossil fuels, blasts the ""myth of progress,"" is no fan of the fruits of technology and scorns multinational companies that produce commodities. And he demands ""sustainable"" development and denounces ""obstructionists,"" ""special interests"" and ""selfish"" leaders.

As the Pope decries capitalism, one must recognize the the opposite would be socialism.  This would not help the Catholic Church at all since ""The proletariat of today takes the side of socialism, which enlists science in the battle against the fog of religion, and frees the workers from their belief in life after death by welding them together to fight in the present for a better life on earth."" Lenin

Finally, in allowing the Catholic Church to take on the left, atheists and the ""greenies"" as its ""strange bedfellows"" , he overlooks the fact that the church does not condone abortion.  And a few other little facts such as the women's role in the Catholic Church and other factors that would preclude these new friends from becoming loyal followers.  In addition, while socialism would mean that the ""downtrodden"" would have to remain content with their ""lot"" in life, one can argue that capitalism has done more to CHANGE lives...... often for the better.  

At the end of the day, the Pope is a man.  He is not infallible and I think he did not get this one right.  He has the ultimate authority over the Church, but this is over-reach as he states:

 ""We fail to see that some are mired in desperate and degrading poverty, with no way out, while others have not the faintest idea of what to do with their possessions, vainly showing off their supposed superiority and leaving behind them so much waste,"" 

Jeb Bush in response stated:

""I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope,"" the former Florida governor said. ""I think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting in the political realm.""

I think that's about right.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/858010554279737/?type=3,2015-06-22 07:40:44,32,1,4,32,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_857229191024540,"Good Saturday Afternoon!

""String 'm up""........  The American Sickness.

America, it seems, is being ripped apart piece by piece.  It began as a way to get votes, getting votes means winning elections.  Winning elections means gaining power.  And gaining power is....... the ultimate goal.  Power means riches and grandeur for the ""winning team"", it means attaining your agenda, it means achieving the utopia your team or you dream of.

So, how do we achieve this political ""win""?  Well first we have to define each part of the whole by dividing this ""whole"" into smaller groups and assigning names and characteristics.  So we divide them (the population) by income (rich, poor or in between); we identify the political groups (Right, Left and Independent); we segregate the age groupings; we identify the gender characteristics; sexual persuasion and then from these larger group divisions, we ""micro-target"" even further to ""fashion"" messages that are unique to each and every group........ even if we have to lie because it is just a ""white lie""..... and it can't hurt anyone.....  Right?    You decide....

Let's discuss the first division, that of political parties.  George Washington, in his farewell address stated the following:

""However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.""

We have witnessed this in our own midst.  One party fighting against the other making untrue statements regarding the history and intent of the other in order to gain power.  The second division is that of race.  Quite frankly, I have never seen race relations so raw and so negative as the past few years.  The Charleston shooter left a ""manifesto"" as his explanation for the massacre that he was planning.  I read it more than once.  And especially certain sections because my mind just has to satisfy itself with some sort of 'explanation"", either sane or insane for anyone committing heinous things.  NO, it does not excuse his behavior, however, the thought of someone killing a vast amount of people after sitting with them in a church without some sort of reasoning.... whether the reasoning is sane or insane., is worse than anything.  It makes this act random.  Random anything random is unsettling, at least for me.  

So, I read his journal.  The first thing I will say is that we are bombarded 24/7 with the Media and Gov't stirring the racial pot.  Everything and anything involves race.  The police are painted as ""racist"", every social institution is ""racist"", common expectations of discipline are ""racist"", school and job tests are ""racist"", one political party is ""racist"", one cable station is ""racist"", certain newspapers are ""racist"", America is ""racist"", the prison system is ""racist"", dolls can be ""racist""...... it seems as though race has become the national pastime.

So along comes this really, really deeply disturbed person by the name of Dylann ""Storm"" Roof.  A young man who did two or three unsuccessful 9th grade stints before dropping out of school to do ""God only knows what"" while apparently staying ""high as a kite"".  Here he was under-educated and full of impotent rage, his ""journal starts out as such:

""I was not raised in a racist home or environment. Living in the South, almost every White person has a small amount of racial awareness, simply beause [sic] of the numbers of negroes in this part of the country.""

I really have not seen nor heard the term ""negro"" in such a long time, but I digress......  He felt that after reading the Trayvon Martin proceedings that George Zimmerman was correct in what he did.  He then Googled ""Black on White Crime"" and then apparently was floored by the number of these cases that go unreported in the newspapers.  He then goes on to say that Black people seem to be racially aware from birth, then describing them as  ""lower beings"" or at least that is how he feels that most white people view Black people.  He also feels that White people are unjustly made to pay for ""slavery"" even though most of the whites in the South never owned slaves.  He somehow deduces that Blacks were happier under the mantle of slavery since their low intelligence (he misrepresented IQ), impulsive nature  and predisposition towards violence is a result of the massive amounts of testosterone in their loins.  He also did not see the reason that George Washington Carver was so celebrated because he was the ""first ""n-word"" to be able to open a peanut.""

Let me make this clear, the image of a ""violent"" Black man is a powerful tool.  And it is used with frequency.  Twice, my husband ran against a white opponent.  One, tried to paint him as a member of a violent motorcycle gang and the other, with the help of his Dad, created a cartoon of my husband punching out white women.  A local radio host added the ""sexual twist.""  These are potent images and are used to influence people in the most nefarious manner. We see it and say nothing.   So, some the same people calling for the ""stringing and hanging"" truly promulgate, promote and believe these images.

Dylann Roof also resented that every history lesson taught to him portrayed white people as bad people or villains.  (For example, Christopher Columbus  who once discovered America is now portrayed as a rapist) He hated what he referred to a ""race mixing"" and gave the anecdote of a horse and a donkey breeding a mule which is an inferior creature.  Having left school in the 9th grade robbed him of the second Biology class that would have introduced him to DNA.  All humans belong to the same species, so basically all human DNA is the same.

""What is not generally realized is that a huge proportion of people who would generally regard themselves as 'white' have at least one black ancestor in the last four generations (as demonstrated by random sampling of DNA in the population). Being simply 'black' or 'white' is based on only a tiny number of genes concerned with skin color. In most cases, skin color is also linked to a number of other genes which determine other characteristics - blood type, nose shape, etc but these are not fixed just to the skin color genes.""

More overall variation could be found, for example, between a white, blond, blue-eyed Icelander and an olive-skinned, brown-eyed Greek both of who would regard themselves as 'white'. ""Answer.com

(That Biology 2 class in the 11th grade might have been a key to opening up some enlightenment. )

So..... who cares Angela!!!!! Let's ""string him up""!!!!!!  He is a racist!  ""Hang him high""This was the hew and cry of every news station this morning.  ""Kill him"", he is the only one! AND if there is another, then kill him too!  One radio station host said he doesn't even need a trial!  Just shoot him! 

Will we ever ask ourselves the origin of his middle name ""Storm"" which happens to be part of the name on many of the white supremacy websites?  ......  Nope, the ""journalists"" just want to string him up and hang him high.

I am grateful for the legal system, which should never be a mob system.  Yes, this man deserves to be punished, but in order to clear up the problem, to cure the ""sickness"" , we have to realize that this crime, no matter how horrific is simply a symptom of what is happening to our youth.  This ""man"" is 21 years old.  I have several sweaters that I still wear that are 28 years old and a jacket that is 30.  Some of his pictures show him stomping on the American flag and burning it in one.  Was this not a ""challenge"" by a Black student, with one lovely young Black girl dancing on the flag for the world to see?   What is happening to make young people hate this country so much?

Our youth and others with not so inquiring minds might digest racial demographic marketing of messages in ways much different than intended.  You see, they are often soooo removed from the concept of political twisting and power that they digest a kernel (often the wrong kernel)  of the information which allows them to take it one step further, and further and further to the point of-madness..... sometimes  Madness that brings us the following statement by Mr. Roof:

"".We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.""

And we know what happened then.

But not all kids, the teenage children of  Sharonda Singleton, one of nine people shot dead by Dylann Roof, had one statement to give:  'We forgive him'.  And the little children led us in this instance, they are not much younger than the shooter.  Sharonda ""did good"", God Bless her soul.  

What happens to Dylann Roof is up to the legal system.  What happens to our society is something that the ""grown folks' will have to take care of.......... that is after we get over the screeching of ""String him up!"", ""hang him high"" and other various and sundry useless phrases.......  The sickness runs deep an this one is uniquely American and only we can cure it.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/857228767691249/?type=3,2015-06-20 16:51:38,36,14,25,36,0,0,0,0,0

R-E-S-P-E-C-T

Hate, is a simple four letter word, it suggests passionate dislike and a feeling of enmity towards a person or group of people.  The emotions of ""hate"" are not present in children when they are born.  It might take years of grooming and experience either dealing with another or being inculcated by the surroundings to reach a level of hate that causes a person to ""act out"", in simple ways or a more horrific manner.  

Fear, is  a big motivator of hate , love can be as well.  How many times do we have to read that a man or woman loved someone so much that they ended up actually ""hating"" them...... to death.  

After horrific events, such as in Charleston, there is a rush to ""love"".  People start singing songs, swaying back and forth, exhorting everyone to ""love one another"".  A little time passes and then people move on..... why?  Because it is impossible to impress upon large groups of people an exhausting emotion such as  ""love"".  Biblicaly, we are required to love one another but maybe the Bible is speaking of another type of love ---- respect....  For example, I really, really liked a show that went off the air in January of this year.  The show was called ""Parenthood"".  Just about every episode involved the emotional and life turmoil of the Braverman family and every episode had one or a few of the children having tears in their eyes over some emotional hurt.  Since everyone has a hurt or pain, if you spread your love and involvement around too thin, you might spend most of your time bawling your eyes out, head-achy and miserable.  I don't believe that God meant for that to be the state of human existence.

So....... instead of the two extreme polar emotions, love and hate, we can choose something in the middle.......  Let's call it ""respect"".  The definition of ""respect"" is to feel or show regard for another person.  This is a simple emotion, often lacking in today's environment for  a couple of reasons (among others)  that begin and end with ""fear"":

>Fear (1).  Internally, we may fear that we are not worthy so w assume those people or that person will ""take something away"" from us.  For example, the reason that ""I have never been able to get this job or that chance in life is because  there is a finite amount of things available and ""they"" are getting it.  We overlook the idea that those people or that person may have qualities that might render them superior your abilities in one way or another.  We see that in the argument regarding rich and poor.  The feeling is that the rich guy over there took ""everything"" or was ""more fortunate"" or somehow managed to ""make it off the backs of poor Joe's like me"".  Internally, you might acknowledge that they just did more than you did but you loathe to admit it because you ""fear"" (again) that you have made mistakes.... and a great deal of them.

>Fear (2):  We are taught to fear another group of people.  This can manifest itself in very bad ways.  In the Middle East, the factions - Jews/Muslims/Sunnis/Shia/ etc....... have long standing differences --- religious, territorial and so- on.  These differences will never, ever be resolved because they have become part of a ""custom"". Things are resolved for a while and then they somehow revert back to the original ""beef"" that began a couple thousand years ago.  In America, the ""fear"" that many people have is stoked often by factions, be it political, religious and customary.  And.... once again, we come back to the idea of ""territory"".  In the news, it is said that the shooter - Dylann Roof was a follower of the 'white supremacy"" movement.  After going onto some of these ""white supremacy"" website, they seem to be quite worried that they might get a ""bad reputation"" because they just ""hate' they don't ""kill"".  On Clementa Pinckney' s Facebook page, Pioneer Little Europe posted: ""Maybe one of my supporters in South Carolina can run for your seat. You don't need it anymore."" This was followed by a winking emoticon.  I visited he website called ""Stormfront"", perhaps because I was curious as to why Dylann Roof had the middle name of ""Storm"" was it given to him or maybe changed by him.  This is the ""mission"" statement for this website:

.""We are a community of racial realists and idealists. We are White Nationalists who support true diversity and a homeland for all peoples. Thousands of organizations promote the interests, values and heritage of non-White minorities. We promote ours. Yet we are demonized as ""racists.""""

So........ feeling a bit nervous, I delved a little further.....  and read this:   ""hi my name is ghost i'm a mystic i consider myself white under the category of pre-celt graeco-anatolian mesopotamian caucasian. im looking for aryan friends.""  

OK, pure nonsense, but I read a little more, and more...... what I found were a collection of domineering leaders and 'misfits"".  Many under-educated seeking people who essentially think like they do.  Dylann Roof probably could not find South Africa on a globe, having repeated the ninth grade twice before dropping out and drifting about from one friend's house to another and sleeping in his car in between and spending his days high as a kite when not watching white supremacy videos...... BTW where did he get his collection?  .  This ""white ruling"" utopia was painted for him as a result of his dysfunctional background..... which we will hear much more of in the coming weeks.  Just as the ISIL or ISIS movement is supposedly recruiting 2000 disenchanted boys and girls from the Western world everyday,  these fringe race groups will also.  And it is not only on the white side, I have listened to Black radio stations which don't do their listeners any favors by constantly looking for examples of ""hidden racism"" even when a white person hands you a chocolate cookie instead of a vanilla one.    

When you add the internet into the mix, with its ability to anonymously post, vilify and tear down targets, your fear can actually grant ""power"".  I often watch the media and internet zero in on a target and begin to rip apart this one target with glee.  The anonymous posters sense ""blood in the water"" and tear apart people limb by limb, dismantling their lives, family and livelihood. The break down their targets for ills that they themselves commit but ""fear"" drives them to viciously attack in order to mitigate the inward feelings of self loathing.

So, what's the point?  The point is, in the absence of ""respect"", the outward manifestation of violence, savagery and madness will continue.  Respect for the achievements, struggles and pain for our fellow ""traveler"" through this life might be just the ""love"" we need and probably even better.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/856556267758499/?type=3,2015-06-19 07:45:10,8,1,13,8,0,0,0,0,0

A Dilemma of Conscience....

This afternoon I listened to President Obama speak about the terrible tragedy at the church in Charleston, South Carolina.  Two things became clear to me:

1.  It is not right or just to use a tragic occasion to push a political agenda.  Case in pint:

""We don't have all the facts, but we do know that once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hand on a gun.""

Given the fact that we now know that the boy's father bought him the gun, what is the President proposing.......  That we completely outlaw gun ownership and confiscate all guns?  The laws regarding mental health and criminal background checks would not have changed this situation at all, nor would it have affected the outcome of the shooting in Connecticut since the reality is that Adam Lanza's mother purchased that gun as well.  If what is being advocated is the complete disarming of American citizens, then the only people who will have guns are criminals and those with nefarious intentions since they are unlikely to ask or care about the legality of gun ownership.   

2.  There is a rush to impose a racial component to this case.  Prior to even knowing anything about this case the invocation of ""hate crime"" and ""racial overtones"" were put forward as a motive.  The President said:

""The good news is I am confident that the outpouring of unity and strength and fellowship and love across Charleston today, from all races, from all faiths, from all places of worship, indicates the degree to which those old vestiges of hatred can be overcome.

That certainly was Dr. King's hope just over 50 years ago after four little girls were killed in a bombing at a black church in Birmingham, Alabama.""

I took a look at this young man's Facebook page, he had as many black friends and white friends.  This boy appeared to be completely unhinged, drug addled and aimless.  At the age of 21 he appeared to not have any direction, much less one pointing him to ""white supremacy"".  How about the probability that he is a deranged stoner and misfit looking for his 15 minutes of ""infamy"" by committing this insanity.  How about the fact that crazies like this commit these types of crimes similar to the one in the theater in Colorado.  

We are igniting the fires of racial hatred as it seems to be the first conclusion reached in any conflict involving Black and white people in this country.  It is NOT 1961 people, this  should not be the first conclusion drawn.

How much better to use our conscience when we are reporting rather than enflaming situations and people in light of a tragedy.  and remember, the people of Norway and France were disarmed when a mass shooting took many lives.

Dylann Roof, 21, identified by the FBI as the Charleston shooting suspect.

The FBI said Roof is 5'9"" and approximately 120 pounds, and could be driving a black 2000 Hyundai Elantra.

""This is an all-hands-on-deck effort with the community as well as law enforcement, and I think that with that effort we will find this person quickly,"" Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said at a press conference.

Roof is from South Carolina and has been arrested twice in the state as an adult, Charleston's Post and Courier newspaper reported.

Roof is from Lexington, S.C.

As for the insignias on his clothing: Roof is seen wearing a black jacket apartheid-era flags of South Africa and Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe).

In looking at his several Facebook pages, he lists a plethora of Black friends and classmates.    A Story that has not been verified:  Witnesses said the suspect sat with attendees of the prayer meeting for an hour before he turned his gun on them. Three men and six women were killed. Three people survived.

One woman, who said she was as cousin of the church's pastor, Sen. Rev. Clementa Pinckney, told NBC News late Wednesday night that the shooter reloaded five different times and told a survivor, ""I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go.""

Police were seen at his mother's house, his uncle told Reuters, adding that he recognized the man as his nephew. ""The more I look at him, the more I'm convinced, that's him,"" Carson Cowles, 56, told the news service in an interview. Cowles described Roof as ""quiet and soft-spoken"" and said his father recently gave the suspect a .45-caliber gun as a birthday gift, Reuters said.

The Hatred of Faith

Clementa Carlos Pinckney (July 30, 1973 – June 17, 2015) was a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate, representing the 45th District since 2000. He was previously a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1997 through 2000.

Pinckney was a senior pastor at Mother Emanuel A.M.E. in Charleston. He died, along with eight members of the congregation, in a mass shooting at an evening bible study at his church on June 17, 2015.

Pinckney was born in Beaufort, South Carolina, the son of Theopia and John Pinckney.  His mother is deceased.

He graduated with a B.A. from Allen University in 1995 and went on to obtain a Master of Public Administration degree from the University of South Carolina in 1999.

Pinckney became pastor of Emanuel A.M.E Church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2010 and he was among several South Carolina pastors to hold rallies after the shooting of Walter Scott in 2015, attracting some local controversy.

Pinckney was first elected to the South Carolina General Assembly in 1996 at the age of 23, becoming the youngest African American elected as a South Carolina state legislator.[13] He served in the South Carolina House of Representatives until being elected to the South Carolina Senate in 2000. As a state senator, Pinckney pushed for laws to require police and other law enforcement officials to wear body cameras.

Pinckney's sister, whose name hasn't been released, was also shot at the church, according to ABC News 4. It was not immediately known if she was killed.

A humble man, Pinckney spoke about his inspirations in a 1999 profile by the Savannah Morning News, saying ""In life, we are all faced with the opportunity to serve. It is at times a hard choice to make but those hard choices yield great rewards. Those rewards are mostly for others and not for ourselves. That's what service is all about.""

Pinckney met the former Jennifer Benjamin in 1993 when he was a student at Allen University and she was at the University of South Carolina.  They married in 1999 and have two children, Eliana and Malana.

We don't know the rest of the victims, however, may Rep. Pinckney rest in peace and his family be comforted through the Lord.  May God welcome his glorious servant, Clementa Carlos Pinckney, home.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/856029027811223/?type=3,2015-06-18 06:55:48,28,14,17,28,0,0,0,0,0

The Great Escape.....

Last year when I visited San Francisco, I went on the little cruise around Alcatraz.  After watching the movie ""Escape From Alcatraz"" years ago, I was intrigued by the ability the caper.  

Alcatraz was supposed to be America's only escape-proof prison. Which is why, 50 years after three men vanished from inside its walls on June 11, 1962, the escape still fascinates. The Rock, an island set in the middle of San Francisco Bay, held the worst of the worst, including Frank Morris and John and Clarence Anglin (who were all serving life sentences for robbery, among other crimes). The men allegedly dug through the concrete fortress using a metal spoon (strengthened with silver from a dime) and an improvised drill crafted from a stolen vacuum cleaner. Adding to the intrigue, they smartly muffled the sound of their drilling with accordions played during music hour and left behind papier-mâché dummies — whose heads they topped with hair stolen from the prison barber shop — in their place. 

Though the prison claimed the men drowned at sea (which would thus maintain the belief that the penitentiary had no successful escapees in its 29 years of operation), their remains have never been found and the U.S. Marshal Service maintains an active case file on the trio. The break was the basis for the 1979 movie Escape from Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood.

I think that I was not the only person looking at the rough, very cold water surrounding the island and thinking that there could not be a way that any man or woman could possibly survive the water, but somehow I think they did.

The manhunt for Matt, 48, and Sweat, 35, is now in its 12th day. The pair broke out of the North Country maximum security prison near the Canadian border using power tools and, allegedly, assistance from prison worker Joyce Mitchell, 51.

Clinton Correctional Facility is a New York State Department of Correctional Services maximum security state prison for men located in the Village of Dannemora, New York.The prison itself is sometimes colloquially referred to as Dannemora, although its actual name is derived from its location in Clinton County, New York.

Built in 1844, it originally served as a site where prisoners were used to work in local mines in both Dannemora and nearby Lyon Mountain. This enterprise would not be profitable, and by 1877, mining had ended, and the prisoners were put to work on other trades. With this change, the prison experienced growth, and in 1887 it was given new concrete walls 30 feet tall that still stand. In 1892, the first prisoner was executed in the electric chair at the prison, beginning the use of capital punishment at Clinton Correctional. Twenty six men were executed between 1892 and 1913. This period also saw many prisoners cured of tuberculosis due in part to the clean air in the Adirondacks, leading to the importation of prisoners with this disease from other prisons.

Some of the current and past notorious residents of this prison include:

>Robert Chambers: the ""preppy murderer"", who served much of his sentence at Clinton Correctional Facility for the manslaughter conviction of Jennifer Levin, as well as a later sentence for drug possession after heroin was found in his cell and new criminal charges were brought.

>Julio Gonzalez: perpetrator of the 1990 Happy Land Fire in the Bronx which killed 87 people.

>Charles ""Lucky"" Luciano: One of the driving forces behind the development of Italian organized crime in the United States served 10 years of a 30- to 50-year sentence for running a prostitution ring before being deported to Italy after World War II.

>Eric Smith: Convicted of killing and sexually assaulting a four-year-old boy at age 13.

>Joel Steinberg: Attorney convicted for the abuse of his common law wife, Hedda Nussbaum, and the abuse murder of his four-year-old stepdaughter.

>2Pac (real name Tupac Shakur): Served 9 months on a sexual abuse conviction from February to October 1995 before being released on appeal.

>Joel Rifkin: referred to as ""Joel the Ripper"" by tabloids after a five-year killing spree. Murdered 17 women, and is serving 203 years to life.

More than 800 local, state and federal officers are popping open trunks, peering into cars and scouring heavily wooded areas. Canine units are also still searching for a scent that might lead police to Matt and Sweat, who escaped from the maximum-security facility known as ""Little Siberia"" in upstate New York on June 6.

Motion detectors and cameras have been placed in the woods, and an airplane able to fly at high altitude and detect movements on the ground is aiding in the search, a New York state official said. But despite promising leads, the official said, the search has gone cold.

And the longer it goes.... the colder the trail gets.

Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie told the Associated Press that Mitchell was ""Plan A"" and, without a backup plan, he believes the escapees are still in the woods, farms or fields near Dannemora, N.Y. More than 800 law enforcement officials have been involved in a search that's largely focused on the towns of Cadyville, Saranc and Plattsburgh.

However, Clinton County Sheriff David Favro told CNN that Mitchell's getaway car was actually ""Plan B."" He suspected their elaborate plan had a more ""fool-proof"" strategy than relying on the woman who worked in the prison's tailoring shop

Sheriff Favro has modified his statement. He said the following to ABC News:  ""I don't know if she was plan A, plan B, or plan C.""

Pretty much,  I feel that Mitchell was never ""Plan A"", way too unstable.   She was the decoy.  They were long gone way before her designated pick up time.  The panic attack was gravy..... they knew she was capable of that.  They were done with her once she  ...provided tools and a cell phone and who knows what else,

Commemorating the first-ever escape in the facility's 170 year history, the men left behind a yellow sticky note on a pipe, with the message, ""Have a nice day!""

Sweat, 35, was serving a life sentence without parole for killing a sheriff's deputy. Matt, 48, was doing 25 years to life for the 1997 kidnap, torture and hacksaw dismemberment of his former boss.  William Rickerson and Kevin Tarsia the original murder victims of this escaped duo will have justice deferred..... perhaps forever.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/855739801173479/?type=3,2015-06-17 13:26:08,2,2,8,2,0,0,0,0,0

17 June 1898 – 27 March 1972), usually referred to as M. C. Escher, was a Dutch graphic artist. He is known for his often mathematically inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints. These feature impossible constructions, explorations of infinity, architecture, and tessellations.

Although Escher did not have mathematical training—his understanding of mathematics was largely visual and intuitive—Escher's work had a strong mathematical component, and more than a few of the worlds which he drew were built around impossible objects such as the Penrose triangle and the Penrose stairs. Many of Escher's works employed repeated tilings called tessellations. Escher's artwork is especially well liked by mathematicians and scientists, who enjoy his use of polyhedra and geometric distortions.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/855618077852318/?type=3,2015-06-17 06:22:17,16,1,3,16,0,0,0,0,0

Who was Sayyid Qutb and why Should We Know About Him?

Sayyid Qutb was born on October 8, 1906 in Asyut Governorate, Egypt.  He was an author, educator, Islamic theorist, poet..... among other things.  Qutb travelled through America from 1948 to 1950.  What was amazing about this short two year visit was that it provided him with a tremendous body of material.

He was shocked at the moral and spiritual degeneracy he observed during this short time, stating that ""No one is more distant than the Americans from spirituality and piety.""   This statement is bound to surprise since we, in America, often view this era as the height of American innocence and Christianity.Over a two year period he worked in several different institutions including what was then Wilson Teachers' College in Washington, D.C. and Colorado State College for Education in Greeley, as well as Stanford University. He also travelled extensively visiting the major cities of the United States and spent time in Europe on the return journey to Egypt. His reaction to the Western experience was decidedly negative; he found Western society hopelessly materialistic, corrupt, morally loose, and ridden with injustice. 

It was said that after he heard the jazz standard ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" an ode to winter romance, he felt that it was the worst example of American hedonism.  After hearing the song at a Colorado church dance in the 1940s,  Sayyid Qutb viewed the song as a moral indictment of the West - views that some say could now shaped the future of the Middle East. 

Qutb was ""scandalized"" by the behavior we now view as quite prurient:  ""Nobody goes to church as often as Americans do. . . . Yet no one is as distant as they are from the spiritual aspect of religion,"" he wrote in ""The America I Have Seen,"" a 20-page tract he published in 1950. 

He was very critical of the American woman:  ""The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs and she knows all this and does not hide it,"" he wrote.

He was critical of things he had observed in the United States: its materialism, individual freedoms, economic system, racism, brutal boxing matches, ""poor"" haircuts, superficiality in conversations and friendships, restrictions on divorce, enthusiasm for sports, lack of artistic feeling, ""animal-like"" mixing of the sexes (which ""went on even in churches""), and strong support for the Israel.

In regards to the Arts, Sayyid Qutb wrote: 

""The American is primitive in his artistic taste, both in what he enjoys as art and in his own artistic works. ""Jazz"" music is his music of choice. This is that music that the Negroes invented to satisfy their primitive inclinations, as well as their desire to be noisy on the one hand and to excite bestial tendencies on the other.""

His brother Muhammad and two of his sisters, Amīnah and Hamīdah, were also writers active in Islamic causes; all suffered arrest for their views along with their brother in 1965.

In his writings Sayyid Qutb attributed his strong bent towards religion to the influence of his parents. His mother, Fātimah Husayn 'Uthmān, had a particular love for the Koran (Qur'ān) which she inculcated in her offspring; she was determined that her children should all become buffāz (memorizers of the holy book). It was her custom to invite professional Koran reciters to the family home during the nights of the month of fasting (Ramadān), and Sayyid Qutb later recalled listening to the chanting of the sacred verses at his mother's side.

So......  why should we know about this man?  Why..... is he important?

 His experience in the U.S. is believed to have formed in part the impetus for his rejection of Western values and his move towards Islamism upon returning to Egypt. Resigning from the civil service, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1950s and became editor-in-chief of the Brothers' weekly Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin, and later head of its propaganda section, as well as an appointed member of the working committee and of its guidance council, the highest branch in the organization.

In 1966 he was convicted of plotting the assassination of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and was executed by hanging.

 Qutb's short ""excursion"" in the United States hardened his views of the West's spiritual and moral bankruptcy - views that formed the basis for his more radical views about violence, jihad and the West.  He has been described by followers as a great thinker and martyr for Islam, while many Western observers see him as a key originator of Islamist ideology. Others in the West believe Qutb is an inspiration for violent groups such as al-Qaeda. Today, his supporters are identified as Qutbists or ""Qutbi"" (by their opponents, not by themselves).

Sayyid Qutb's mature political views always centered on Islam—Islam as a complete system of morality, justice and governance, whose sharia laws and principles should be the sole basis of governance and everything else in life - though his interpretation of it varied.  A staunch anti-Semite, he anything non-Islamic was evil and corrupt, while following sharia as a complete system extending into all aspects of life, would bring every kind of benefit to humanity, from personal and social peace, to the ""treasures"" of the universe.

Qutb had influence on Islamic insurgent/terror groups in Egypt and elsewhere. His influence on al-Qaeda was felt through his writing, his followers and especially through his brother, Muhammad Qutb, who moved to Saudi Arabia following his release from prison in Egypt and became a professor of Islamic Studies and edited, published and promoted his brother Sayyid's work.

Qutb dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that 'nothing will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence....... many of the notorious names in the Islamic world were followers of his literature.  one of his central beliefs was that tno middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslim—as he defined them—therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.

The  Origin of Race.......  (please do not comment without reading)

After such a spirited discussion today, I feel very ""frisky"" because we have now gotten to where I wanted to lead you.  Let's take a look at the concept of ""race"" from the Christian and non-Christian point of view and then YOU can come to your own conclusions......

How did the human race begin? The Scriptures introduce man as a created being. In Genesis 1:27 this truth is stated, ""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.""   Evolution has no solution for the origin of life. Science never has been able to produce life out of that which was not life. 

In the creation of man he was made in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:27). There is no development in evolution could ever take an animal and produce in it that which corresponds to the image 
of God. 

Now, have been created ""in the image of God"",  the essential qualities of personality, intellect or mind, sensibility or feeling, and will, meaning the spirit of discernment as well as the ability to choose  is inherent in the abilities of those created in the image of God...... otherwise known as ""man"" and ""woman"".

Keep in mind that no other creature on this earth is in possession of ALL of these gifts......  Not a one.  Which is why ""man"" is ""responsible"" for his or her own actions.  Man is a creature with the developed sense of morals, a gift that makes ""responsibility"" possible.

Adam and Eve had ""consciences"" (developed from that heightened sense of morality and discernment ) that enabled them to distinguish right from wrong, however, that did not make them good, and their posterity drifted farther and farther from God until God decided to destroy the whole human race, except Noah and his family (Gen. 6:13). 

I know that I am missing a great deal of Scripture and ""begets""  here but space and length does not allow.......  just follow along.  God gave to Noah the basic principles of human government. However, the human race again demonstrated its depravity by building the Tower of Babel,(to reach the sky and challenge God) and God had to judge by confusing the languages of the people.    The name ""Babel"" means ""to confound"".

After God  ""confounded"" the languages of all the people on earth. Genesis 10:5, states that God divided them in their lands by their family, and nation. The confounding of their languages was done in orderly fashion by God and families and tribes were given the same language. Noah's three sons are stated as being three divisions of man. Thus, at least three languages were needed to separate them and possibly many more. Some anthropologists believe that the languages found today developed from some forty to fifty earlier linguistic divisions.

Traditionally biblical scholars have concluded that the three races were the progeny of Noah's three sons, Shem, Japheth and Ham.

.  Japheth is the father of the Caucasian race;

.  Shem of the Mongoloid race; 

.  Ham of the Negroid race. 

So what is race?  RACE:   Any of the major biological divisions of mankind, distinguished by color and texture of hair, color of skin and eyes, stature, bodily proportions, etc: many ethnologists now consider that there are only three primary divisions, the Caucasian (loosely 'white race ), Negroid (loosely 'black race ) and Mongoloid (loosely, 'yellow race ), with various subdivisions: the term has acquired so many unscientific connotations that in this sense it is often replaced in scientific usage by 'ethnic stock  or 'group .""

The task of defining race is highly subjective and therefore, unscientific. We can consequently conclude that race is not clearly definable and is not a good term to use in describing variations among people.

So.......   ""Are there races of men?"" The difficulty of classifying man into races has been shown. Perhaps a better term would be ""varieties"" of man. Even evolutionary science concludes that all existing varieties of man are members of the SAME SPECIES.

Inter-racial marriages are common and children are produced with no biological difficulties. Prominent anthropologist, Ruth Benedict in her book, ""Race: Science and Politics"" stated the peoples of the earth are a single family and have a common origin.

IN OTHER WORDS, if all human beings have as their origin a single family and a common origin, AND if all races (if one believes in the Bible) are descendants of the three sons of Noah, the EQUALITY among the ""races"" exist in fact (not one brother is higher than the other).  So, in essence if all are of one family, with the ""varieties"" being present and not ACTUAL BIOLOGICAL differences, then the existence of ""race' as we know it is simply a human construct, not one mandated by God.

Other Myths regarding race:

>  Once supposed biological differences, such as dissimilarity in blood, have proven to be incorrect. Blood is classified according to type, and all types are found within all supposed races of man. Blood transfusions are based on types A, B, AB, and O and are given without regard to race.

>  It has also been supposed that different races have differing intelligence levels. This false and racist idea concludes that the Caucasian race is the most intelligent with the Negroid race being the least intelligent. This idea originated with Charles Darwin's false, inflammatory, and evolutionary idea that man is a descendant of primates. He concluded quite unscientifically that the Negro is more closely related to monkeys and apes because they look more like a primate. Since a Caucasian looks the least like a primate, Darwin said they were higher up on the supposed evolutionary chain and was more intelligent. Often the Oriental is portrayed as being the more advanced species of man because of less body hair.

Is the Idea of Race Promulgated by the Bible?

 NO! NO! NO!  The term race does not appear in the Bible. The Bible refers to differing peoples in terms such as family, tribe, people and nation. It groups people according to familial relationships and then into nationalities.

So for those who Believe:  When God called Abraham, as Genesis 12:3 records, he stated that ""In thee all the families of earth would be blessed."" Genesis 22:18, says that from Abraham's seed "". . .all the nations of earth would be blessed."" 

Not one of us is above the other and not one of us is separate from the other.  The human condition requires division because it is man's sometimes evil inner feelings to classify him/herself as ""better"" than that one ""over there"".  Superior, to others and thus more ""God"" or ""Christ"" - like.  These ""divisions"" are simply the figment of our ""feeble"" minds that we have trained to recognize the ""gods"" of false religion.  

It is not uncommon to hear Christians responding to this question with explanations, which have roots in evolution and other un-biblical teaching. Many times we hear false FAIRY TALES  such as: the tanning effects of the sun on people who settled in Africa causing the development of very dark skin; or people in the Far East (because of a more moderate climate) resulting in the development of the yellow tones of Oriental peoples; or Caucasian peoples of the Northern hemisphere having lighter or white skin because of being exposed to a lesser degree of sunlight. Other explanations often offered as the origin of race are the curse on Cain (Gen. 4:10-15) and on Ham's son Canaan (Gen. 9:20-25). Such explanations are false and are not supported by the Bible, or by science.Romans 10:11-13:

THESE ARE ALL FALSE.

     ""For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved"" (Rom. 10:11-13).

     Both the Old and New Testaments show that God does not hold any significance to race. God sees all people as one people called ""man."" Physical characteristics are not a part of God's evaluation of man "". . .for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart"" (I Samuel l6:7).

This is the story people, I know that I will hear so many fairy tales based upon individual fantasies of superior races and inferior intelligence but the truth is...... it really ain't true.  All of the evil which has passed on to their just rewards have now reaped what they sowed in ignorance and hatred.  

Finally, given the equality of races and the fact that the concept does not really exist........  how can anyone lie about it?  Further, given the evidence above, is it not truly blasphemous to think any different?",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/855010981246361/?type=3,2015-06-15 17:52:48,20,18,20,20,0,0,0,0,0

Three Things that the Rachel Dolezal Story Tells Us About America's Race ""Problem""

At first i was curious about this story.  I thought that It was interesting but never would I have imagined that this story would have taken on such a national flurry of stories, comments and in some cases outrage as the idea that a Caucasian woman should choose to live her life as a ""Black"" or ""African-American"" woman.    In short, I just want to highlight three points:

(1)  We are NOT living in a ""Post -Racial"" society.  While there are many stories, comments and ""pickles"" that needed ""clarification"" or apology by news characters and politicians alike, nothing has ""captured"" the air-waves with such angst and anger as the seemingly ""preposterous"" idea that a Caucasian woman with ""peaches and cream"" complexion, ""naturally straw colored hair"" and a ""solid Caucasian, northern European"" heritage (these were some of the descriptions that I have read), should relegate herself to an implicated ""inferior"" life of living as a Black woman, marrying a Black man and having Black children.  Her brother even suggested that she lived in ""Black Face"", which prompted me to check his age since  Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used by performers to represent a black person. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the proliferation of stereotypes such as the ""happy-go-lucky darky on the plantation"" or the ""dandified coon"".  She was portraying neither stereotype and the suggestion of such FROM HER OWN FAMILY is breathtaking. 

This has also brought about a visceral responses from some people that I have known for more than just a short time.  One woman told me that she Just could not understand why an attractive white woman would do something like that to herself""....... she felt that Ms. Dolezal must be ""psychotic"" or at least ""bi-polar"".  A gentleman stated to me that his daughter's only ""date"" African American men and it was a ""sexual thing"".  I found that ""uber"" creepy and decided his name was to be deleted from my ""contact list""..... permanently.  

Regardless of the response, the basic theme of ""superiority"" and ""inferiority"" abound.  ""Passing"" has been around for several centuries.  Other races have frequently ""passed"" for the dominant culture ""white"" in order to gain societal and economical advantages.  In the Caribbean and Africa, there are warnings given out  to people using ""skin bleaches"" which result in grey skin at best and skin cancer at worst.  There are more cultures on this earth that celebrate and promulgate the superiority of a lighter complexion over a darker one.  This is a fact.  But in America, the race issue has gone from ""overt"" with laws and structures protecting one race over another to ""covert"" inferences, rules and only occasional ""slips""..... Such as when Senator Harry Reid is quoted in a new book as saying that Barack Obama ... black president because he was ""light-skinned"" with ""no Negro dialect. Or when Vice President Biden called Obama first ""clean"" African-American candidate.  Both of these men are ""liberal"", espousing their  ""love for the Blacks"", yet they suggested that most Black men talked with an odd dialect and needed to take more showers or baths because they were naturally dirty.  

This obsession continues to the ""hair texture"".  There is more outrage regarding this woman's hair texture than anything else.  Why would she do this, seems to be the echo on both sides of the color spectrum......  This idea of ""good"" and ""bad"" hair texture can be summed up by a spectrum which states that the silkier and more ""European"" the hair texture, the more it falls into the ""good hair"" category"".  The coarser, shorter and curlier......it is considered ""bad"".

(2)  We are hypocrites who lack perspective.  Bruce Jenner is a 65 year old father of six children, 6'2"", thick boned Olympian, over 200 pounds and still in possession of his penis.  Yet we are willing, no gleeful to get a glimpse of his burly frame  in a maxi halter dress and kitten slippers on his veranda while vilifying anyone calling him anything but his new moniker ""Caitlyn"".

ESPN announced Monday that Jenner will be presented with the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at its annual award ceremony in Los Angeles this July. It will be broadcast at 8 p.m. July 15 on ABC.  Naturally, this broadcast will be watched with tears and misty eyes, yet what level of ""bravery"" is all of this showing?  And by the way there will be several people NOT watching this stunt......

That would be the woman whose vehicle was hit in the fatal car accident involving Caitlyn Jenner in February.  She  has filed a lawsuit against the Olympian formerly known as as Bruce Jenner.  Naming Bruce Jenner a/k/a Caitlyn Jenner in the civil case filed in Los Angeles on Monday, Jessica Steindorff is asking for compensatory and punitive damages. 

Also not watching would be Kim Howe who  died in the multi-vehicle crash when her car was knocked into oncoming traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. Jenner, 65, is also being sued for wrongful death by the two adult stepchildren of Howe, who was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash........  I guess they won't enjoy the awards program either.Apparently,Jenner's Escalade rear-ended Howe's Lexus, propelling it into the path of an oncoming Hummer.

We celebrate this person, his changes and his life while shunning another because of race.  We want taxpayers to pay for race changes in prison and for low income people wanting to switch but rabidly attack someone getting a tan, perm and declaring herself ""black"".

(3) We are blind...... at least when it comes to race..... on both ends of the spectrum.  In my family, I have people who from the outside have paler skin , straighter hair, and green or blue eyes.  These members of my family consider themselves as part of the ""black"" race.  Racial constructs have been used innocently as a means of classification and they have also been used for more sinister applications.  When you visit the Holocaust museum in Washington DC, you will discover that the Nazi's used clear classifications of races, so as to highlight the ""superior"" or Aryan race as it was.  The destruction of ""others"" were planned, based upon these classifications.  

One can argue that there are different cultures and sometimes these cultures do not mix harmoniously, however, cultural values, beliefs and constructs are often outside of the benign pigment that exists beneath the surface of our skin.  Until people understand that the ""pigment"" itself is not an indicator to ""superiority or inferiority"" this constant ""twisting"" will continue on.  It's effects on our society linger on and is often deleterious on our society as we see that the darker hues of our society appear to be over-represented in negative institutions such as prisons and ghettos as well as having negative upward means of mobility.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is an African-American civil rights organization in the United States, formed in 1909.   Its mission is ""to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination"". Its name, retained in accordance with tradition, uses the once common term colored people.

The Race Riot of 1908 in Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois, had highlighted the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. This event is often cited as the catalyst for the formation of the NAACP.

.  Mary White Ovington, a white woman,  was born April 11, 1865, in Brooklyn, New York. Her grandmother attended the Connecticut congregation of Samuel Joseph May. Her parents, members of the Unitarian Church were supporters of women's rights and had been involved in anti-slavery movement. Educated at Packer Collegiate Institute and Radcliffe College, Ovington became involved in the campaign for civil rights in 1890 after hearing Frederick Douglass speak in a Brooklyn church.  She was a socialist.

.  William English Walling, a white man, was an American labor reformer and Socialist Republican born into a wealthy family in Louisville, Kentucky. He founded the National Women's Trade Union League in 1903. Moved by his investigation of a 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois, he was among the co-founders of the NAACP in 1909.and 

. Henry Moskowitz , a white  Jewish man,  born on September 25, 1879 in Romania. He was Jewish. He migrated to the United States in 1883. He attended the New York City public schools and then graduated from the City College of New York in 1899. In 1906 he earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Erlangen in Germany.

They met in New York City in January 1909 along with others and the NAACP was born.  

The NAACP issued a statement Friday in support of a local NAACP leader in Washington state who has been accused by her family of misrepresenting herself as black.

The civil rights group rushed to the defense of Rachel Dolezal, the head of the NAACP Spokane chapter, after the woman's parents told a newspaper Thursday her ancestry was white with some ""faint traces"" of Native American heritage.

Why they (her parents) did this, who knows? 

 But given the racial make-up of the original founders, ""One's racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership"".  In fact it should not be an issue.  But what is an issue  of greater concern is the vitriol that accompanies a person's desire to identify themselves as an African American.  ………  In this country, a man can identify as a woman and a woman can identify as a man.  Same sex marriage is being represented as a ""civil right"", and a woman who can not [rove she is Native American is elected to the Senate.  

Given all of these situations………  why is it so outrageous that a white woman would consider herself as a Black woman?  Not only is it her business, it is less of a ""stretch"", given her appearance, causes and lifestyle for the last few years than any other aforementioned combination.

She was the oldest of the six children taken by their parents, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, into Hitler's Berlin bunker on April 22 1945. Her name was Helga.

Faced with the inevitability of defeat, Goebbels, the Nazi Propaganda Minister, had determined to await defeat and death alongside the Fuhrer. Other leading Nazis had protected their children by sending them into the mountains or out of the country, but Magda Goebbels decided that she and the children would join her husband to bring their lives to what she called ""the only possible and honourable conclusion"".

Joseph Goebbels wrote almost every day of his adult life. His focus is his own importance in public events and his children feature rarely. When they do, he shows a chillingly distant delight in them: ""I speak to the children on the telephone. They are all so sweet. How attached one can become to such tiny, insignificant beings!""

For a bright 12-year-old the signs of the desperation of the situation must have been obvious. Women and children who were fleeing from the advancing Russian army streamed past their home, bringing stories of atrocities. 

At the end of 1944 Goebbels commissioned a propaganda film about his two oldest girls, Helga and Hilde, visiting a military hospital, and giving the soldiers flowers. The girls were so visibly horrified by the mutilated patients that the project had to be abandoned.
From 1944-45 the children lived with  a nanny and their grandmothers in the Goebbels' rural residence of Waldhof am Bogensee. Joseph was mostly in Berlin, Magda often with him. Diaries describe the excitement of the children when he came home, but also how he ""liked to tease the children"", particularly the only boy, nine-year-old Helmut.

Both grandmothers lived in log cabins on the Bogensee estate. Magda's mother Auguste, who avoided all contact with Joseph, whom she hated, was suicidal and alarmed  the children, with her constant wailing. Every Sunday the children would visit their Goebbels grandmother and sing to her. Katherina Goebbels was very critical of her son the Reich Minister, always asking in her strong Rhineland accent, '""What has that boy done now?""

Helga was always said to be Hitler's ""favorite little girl"". No one elaborates on this nor has much been written as to why but this was the case from the age of 3 on according to the documents.  She was always given attention, especially on the occasion of his birthday.

On May 1 1945, one of Hitler's doctors, Ludwig Stumpfegger, who helped Magda crush cyanide tablets between the children's teeth as they slept.  When the first Russians entered the bunker two days later they discovered the children's bodies. They were lying in their beds wearing white nightclothes, completely unmarked, except for Helga. According to the autopsy the Russians carried out, bruising on her face indicated that force had been needed to administer the cyanide to her. 

Helga, the eldest of Joseph's children, was only twelve when she was murdered by her own parents. Hilde was eleven. Helmut was nine, Holde was eight, Hedda almost seven, and Heide just four.

The pictures of Hitler and Helga are hard to look at.... by today's standards.....",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/853402991407160/?type=3,2015-06-12 08:18:02,46,23,23,46,0,0,0,0,0

Annelies Marie ""Anne"" Frank 

12 June 1929 – February 1945 was a diarist and writer. She is one of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Her wartime diary The Diary of a Young Girl has been the basis for several plays and films. Born in the city of Frankfurt in Weimar Germany, she lived most of her life in or near Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. Born a German national, Frank lost her citizenship in 1941. She gained international fame posthumously after her diary was published. It documents her experiences hiding during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II.

The Frank family moved from Germany to Amsterdam in 1933, the year the Nazis gained control over Germany. By May 1940, they were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, the family went into hiding in some concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father worked. After two years, the group was betrayed and transported to concentration camps. Anne Frank and her sister, Margot Frank, were eventually transferred to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they died (probably of typhus) in February or March 1945.

Otto Frank, the only survivor of the family, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that Anne's diary had been saved by one of the helpers, Miep Gies, and his efforts led to its publication in 1947. It has since been translated into many languages. It was translated from its original Dutch version and first published in English in 1952 as The Diary of a Young Girl. The diary, which was given to Anne on her thirteenth birthday, chronicles her life from 12 June 1942 until 1 August 1944.  Wikipedia

Carly Fiorina is a Force!

It is time, it is time.  I have been somewhat under the weather for the past week, suffering from my annual bronchitis malady.  In between trying to fight it off by walking, yoga and stretching, I have had long bouts of laying in bed listening to ALL of the news stations.  At roughly 4:00 am or so, Brett Bair was interviewing Carly Fiorina.  My desire to get out an walk was met by my greater fear of small crawling animals such as raccoons or hedgehogs of muskrats or burrowing owls, or skunks, or .......  any other critter with small beady eyes.  So I settled in with some tea and watched Ms. Fiorina.  

Her demeanor is very self possessed, calm and assured.  She spoke with authority and knowledge leaving out overemphasis, histrionics or emotionalism.  She was the epitome of a professional, an executive and a contender.  She was ""on point"" and answered each and every question posed to her with aplomb.  No ""heartstrings"" stories....... evoking false sounds of strange accents, Black poetry , imaginary immigrant family members, or entreaties for the public to vote for her ""because she is a woman"".  I could not imagine her ""bugging"" her eyes from her head, balling up plump little fists  and screaming ""what difference does it make"" in reference to men dying in a place called Benghazi.

""The nation is at a pivotal point,"" said Fiorina. ""The gulf between how people feel about their lives and what's going on in Washington is huge. The disconnect between regular people and the political class is wide and growing."" Yahoo News

At an event in Washington, D.C., Thursday evening, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO will argue that conservatives should embrace a term that some shy away from, according to her prepared remarks.  

She is bold enough to tout ""feminism"".  

Feminism began as a rallying cry to empower women,"" she will say at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. ""But over the years, feminism has devolved into a left-leaning political ideology where women are pitted against men and used as a political weapon to win elections.""

And we, on the right have fallen into the left's narrative by coining such phrases as ""Femi-Nazi"" which then makes us look as though we want to tether women barefooted to the birthing table and the kitchen table.

Ms. Fiorina offered her own definition: ""A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses. … A woman may choose to have five children and home-school them. She may choose to become a CEO, or run for President.""

You go, girl..........  THIS is a woman I want MY daughter's to listen to.  Her message is wayyyyyyy too important to miss.  For the right side of the aisle to remain viable, we must neutralize the ideas and attacks coming from the left that emphasize ""the war on women"" or the incorrect claim that the party is composed of ""old , rich, Caucasian men"" ............  because as long as that is all the public might see, that is all they will perceive.  And as we all know:

Perceptions are reality.... and ...""Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one."" – Albert Einstein

428053320608798_853371361410323,"Landmark Case June 12, 1967:  Loving v. Virginia

Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. (1967), is a landmark civil rights decision of the United States Supreme Court, which invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage.

The case was brought by Mildred Loving, a black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, who had been sentenced to a year in prison in Virginia for marrying each other. Their marriage violated the state's anti-miscegenation statute, the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which prohibited marriage between people classified as ""white"" and people classified as ""colored"". The Supreme Court's unanimous decision determined that this prohibition was unconstitutional, reversing Pace v. Alabama (1883) and ending all race-based legal restrictions on marriage in the United States.

The decision was followed by an increase in interracial marriages in the U.S., and is remembered annually on Loving Day, June 12. It has been the subject of two movies, as well as several songs. Beginning in 2013, it was cited as precedent in U.S. federal court decisions holding restrictions on same-sex marriage in the United States unconstitutional.

Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion for the unanimous court held that:

""Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival.... To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.""

""There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy.""

Associate Justice Potter Stewart filed a brief concurring opinion. He reiterated his opinion from McLaughlin v. Florida that ""it is simply not possible for a state law to be valid under our Constitution which makes the criminality of an act depend upon the race of the actor.""

Background:

Mildred Loving was partially African American and Native American. Throughout her life, she referred to herself as Indian rather than black. Mildred's family had deep roots in the area around Central Point, Virginia, where blacks and whites mixed freely with little racial tension even at the height of the Jim Crow era.

As a girl, Mildred was so skinny, she was nicknamed ""Bean."" She was just 11 years old and attending an all-black school when she first met Richard Loving, a 17-year-old white high school student. Quietly, the two fell in love and began dating and when Mildred became pregnant at the age of 18, the two decided to get married.

Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924 (known as an anti-miscegenation law) barred the Lovings from marrying in their home state, so the couple drove 90 miles north to Washington, D.C. to tie the knot and then returned to their home in Caroline County, Virginia. They'd been married just a few weeks when, in the early morning hours of July 11, 1958, the county sheriff and two deputies, acting on an anonymous tip that the Lovings were in violation of the law, stormed into the couple's bedroom.

""Who is this woman you're sleeping with?"" the sheriff asked the startled Richard Loving. Mildred offered up the answer: ""I'm his wife."" When she pointed to the couple's marriage certificate hanging on the wall, the sheriff coldly replied, ""That's no good here.""

Richard ended up spending a night in jail, the pregnant Mildred several more, and the couple eventually pleaded guilty to violating the Virginia law, which recognized citizens as ""pure white"" only if they could claim white lineage all the way back to 1684.

""Almighty God created the races white, white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents,"" presiding Judge Leon M. Bazile ruled.

For Richard Loving, the argument was a simple one: 

""Tell the court I love my wife, and it is just unfair that I can't live with her in Virginia."" 

On June 12, 1967, the high court agreed unanimously in favor of the Lovings, striking down Virginia's law.

Richard and Mildred soon moved back to Virginia, returning to Caroline County, where they built a home and raised their children. Tragically, Richard was killed in an automobile accident in 1975, when his car was struck by another vehicle operated by a drunk driver. Mildred, who was also in the car, lost sight in her right eye.

Mildred continued to shy away from the attention and granted very few interviews.""What we wanted, we wanted to come home."" to Virginia ...lawfully.....

Japan, which consists of 98% Japanese nationals, is one of the most homogeneous societies on this earth.  This young lady is the epitome of determination and ""chutzpah"".......  having endured much of what none of us in America have witnessed.... at least not in the last 50 years.

Miyamoto was born and raised in Japan. Her mother is Japanese and her father is an African American who was stationed at the U.S. naval base in Sasebo, Japan.

As a child, Miyamoto endured daily discrimination and racial taunts. Two decades later, in her new high-profile role, she is facing down that same bigotry.

""In school I had trash thrown at me and was laughed at, and everyone pretended not to notice. When I was talking to my friends in the classroom, both boys and girls would be told not to talk to me,"" she said.

On field trips and especially in the swimming pools, the children tried not to hold hands with her or even rub up against her because they were afraid that her color would rub off on their fair skin.

 Miyamoto's selection won favorable reviews for the most part, many anonymous critics took to Japanese social media, attacking her looks, challenging her stand on racial issues and questioning whether someone with a mixed racial background should represent Japan.he fact that Miyamoto is of mixed race, or a ""hafu"", has drawn negative backlash from Japanese audiences who feel that Miss Japan should be pure Japanese.

Many Japanese seem to struggle with the concept of discrimination. A court in Kyoto recently ruled that it is permissible for landlords to refuse to rent to foreigners or non-Japanese — based on nothing more than race or ethnicity.

She stated that was precisely why at the age of 21 she decided to pursue the title.  In addition she learned that no biracial person had ever entered the Miss Universe-Japan pageant, let alone won.

We will be watching this fabulous lady!

428053320608798_852581981489261,"Falling through the ""Cracks""

The Death of Kalief Browder

On Saturday, May 15, 2010, ten days before his seventeenth birthday, Kalief Browder and a friend were returning home from a party in the Belmont section of the Bronx.

As they passed East 186th Street, Browder saw a police car driving toward them. More squad cars arrived, and soon Browder and his friend found themselves squinting in the glare of a police spotlight. An officer said that a man had just reported that they had robbed him. ""I didn't rob anybody,"" Browder replied. ""You can check my pockets.""

The officers searched him and his friend but found nothing. As Browder recalls, one of the officers walked back to his car, where the alleged victim was, and returned with a new story: the man said that they had robbed him not that night but two weeks earlier. The police handcuffed the teens and pressed them into the back of a squad car. 

At the Forty-eighth Precinct, the pair were fingerprinted and locked in a holding cell. A few hours later, when an officer opened the door, Browder jumped up: ""I can leave now?"" Instead, the teens were taken to Central Booking at the Bronx County Criminal Court.

Late on Saturday, seventeen hours after the police picked Browder up, an officer and a prosecutor interrogated him, and he again maintained his innocence. The next day, he was led into a courtroom, where he learned that he had been charged with robbery, grand larceny, and assault. 

The judge ordered him to be held and set bail at three thousand dollars. The amount was out of reach for his family, and soon Browder found himself aboard a Department of Correction bus. He fought back panic, he told me later. Staring through the grating on the bus window, he watched the Bronx disappear. Soon, there was water on either side as the bus made its way across a long, narrow bridge to Rikers Island.

Male adolescents are confined in the Robert N. Davoren Center—known as R.N.D.C. When Browder arrived, the jail held some six hundred boys, aged sixteen to eighteen. Conditions there are notoriously grim. In August of this year, a report by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York described R.N.D.C. as a place with a ""deep-seated culture of violence,"" where attacks by officers and among inmates are rampant. The report featured a list of inmate injuries: ""broken jaws, broken orbital bones, broken noses, long bone fractures, and lacerations requiring stitches.""

Browder's family could not afford to hire an attorney, so the judge appointed a lawyer named Brendan O'Meara to represent him. Browder told O'Meara that he was innocent and assumed that his case would conclude quickly. Even the assistant district attorney handling the prosecution later acknowledged in court papers that it was a ""relatively straightforward case.

Browder said that, one night soon after he arrived, a group of guards lined him and several other inmates up against a wall, trying to figure out who had been responsible for an earlier fight. ""They're talking to us about why did we jump these guys,"" he said. ""And as they're talking they're punching us one by one."" Browder said that he had nothing to do with the fight, but still the officers beat him.

On the morning of July 28, 2010, Browder was awakened at around half past four. He was handcuffed to another inmate and herded onto a bus with a group of other prisoners. A grand jury had voted to indict Browder. The criminal complaint alleged that he and his friend had robbed a Mexican immigrant named Roberto Bautista—pursuing him, pushing him against a fence, and taking his backpack. Bautista told the police that his backpack contained a credit card, a debit card, a digital camera, an iPod Touch, and seven hundred dollars. Browder was also accused of punching Bautista in the face.

He never met nor heard of this man.

Browder repeatedly told O'Meara, his court-appointed lawyer, that he would never plead guilty and that he wanted to go to trial. O'Meara assumed that his courtroom defense would be ""Listen, they got the wrong kid."" After all, the accusation had been made a week or two after the alleged robbery, and the victim had later changed his mind about when it occurred. (The original police report said ""on or about May 2,"" but Bautista later told a detective that it happened on May 8th.)

Not long after arriving on Rikers, Browder made his first trip to solitary confinement. It lasted about two weeks, he recalls, and followed a scuffle with another inmate. ""He was throwing shoes at people—I told him to stop,"" Browder said. ""I actually took his sneaker and I threw it, and he got mad. He swung on me, and we started fighting."" Browder was placed in shackles and transferred by bus to the Central Punitive Segregation Unit, which everyone on Rikers calls the Bing. Housed in one of the island's newer jails, the Bing has four hundred cells, each about twelve feet by seven.

For Browder, this was the first of several trips to the Bing. As he soon discovered, a prisoner there doesn't leave his cell except to go to rec, the shower, the visit room, the medical clinic, or court; whenever he does leave, he is handcuffed and strip-searched. To pass the time, Browder read magazines—XXL, Sports Illustrated, Hip Hop Weekly—and street novels handed on by other inmates.

Summer is the worst time of year to be stuck in the Bing, since the cells lack air-conditioning. In the hope of feeling a breeze, Browder would sleep with the window open, only to be awakened at 5 A.M., when the cell filled with the roar of planes taking off from LaGuardia, one of whose runways is less than three hundred feet from Rikers. He would spend all day smelling his own sweat and counting the hours until his next shower.

For several years he was a resident of solitary confinement ..... for a crime he did not commit.  He was routinely beaten by guards.

On March 13, 2013, Browder appeared before a new judge, Patricia M. DiMango, who had been transferred from Brooklyn as part of a larger effort to tackle the Bronx's backlog. She was known for her no-nonsense style when dealing with defendants; at the Brooklyn courthouse, she was referred to as Judge Judy. 

His battle to prove his innocence had ended. No trial, no jury, no verdict. An assistant district attorney filed a memo with the court explaining that Bautista, the man who had accused Browder, had gone back to Mexico.   

The ordeal took three years and his childhood.  It was finally over.......And he was changed......he preferred to spend time by himself, alone in his bedroom, with the door closed. Sometimes he found himself pacing, as he had done in solitary. When he saw old friends, he was reminded of their accomplishments and what he had not achieved: no high-school diploma, no job, no money, no apartment of his own.

One day last November, six months after his release, Browder retreated to his bedroom with a steak knife, intending to slit his wrists. A friend happened to stop by, saw the knife, and grabbed it. When he left the house to find Browder's mother, Browder tried to hang himself from a bannister. An ambulance rushed him to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was admitted to the psychiatric ward. In his medical record, a social worker describes the suicide attempt as ""serious.""

He learned that he had passed the G.E.D. on the first try. He felt some of his pride coming back.  He found a part-time job, working for a friend who runs a jewelry business in the same building as Prestia's office, near Wall Street. On May 29th—four days after his twenty-first birthday, and a year to the day after DiMango told him that he would be set free—Browder stood on a sidewalk in front of a Chase bank, handing out flyers advertising the jewelry business. He liked Wall Street—being surrounded by people with briefcases and suits, everyone walking with a sense of purpose. ""When I see professional people, I see myself,"" he said. ""I say, 'I want to be like them.' ""

He spent more than one thousand days on Rikers waiting for a trial that never happened. During that time, he endured about two years in solitary confinement, been abused by officers and inmates on Rikers.  Surveillance footage shows some of the abuse by guards at rikers:

Two Things that are True.

""That's well known. It's an unfortunate fact that in the male black population, a very significant percentage of them, more so than whites or other minority candidates, because of convictions, prison records, are never going to be hired by a police department. That's a reality. That's not a byproduct of stop-and-frisk,"" Bratton said.

He added that within black communities, some ""15 to 20% of black males have some type of criminal history and that's an issue of great concern in the black community.""

This was the result of an interview with NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton.

Of course everyone went ballistic and started using the usual word ""racist""!

It has become so Politically Correct in America today to lie to ourselves; to lie to others and to pretend that we are not seeing what is plainly clear to our ""lying"" eyes.  Here are  twoof the most popular lies today:

>We tell ourselves that a man can change into a woman and a woman into a man.... biologically just because they want to and they get the right operation.....  we then brand these people as ""brave"" when in fact  the XY sex-determination system is the sex-determination system found in humans, most other mammals, some insects.  In this system, the sex of an individual is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes (gonosomes). Females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), and are called the homogametic sex. Males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the heterogametic sex.

So, we can call a man by the name of Herman.... Hermanita, we can do his hair, makeup and buy feminine clothing, remove his penis and insert breast implants and put Hermanita on the cover of Vogue.  The reality is that the chromosomes are still XY which biologically makes Hermanita a male.  The same goes for when Susan becomes Sam except that the chromosomes are XY.  

Given the complexity of the operation(s) and the changes that one's family will go through, people might consider that acts of ""bravery"" but there are also other descriptive words that might be used.  In this world people are capable of calling themselves anything they want and doing whatever they want but there will be many people who subject themselves to this and become even more depressed with the outcome...  especially those without the reality show and cover-girl potential.

>Another lie we tell ourselves is one based in self imposed guilt and the inability to digest truth in regards to race.  While there ARE many Black men who have never been to jail, it is NOT insensitive to state an honest truth.  Approximately 12%-13% of the American population is African-American, but they make up 40% of the almost 2.1 million male inmates in jail or prison (U.S. Department of Justice, 2009).

Is it because of ""racism""?  Sometimes it might be......  that is a reality.  But what is also a reality is that 78 percent of Black children grow up WITHOUT two parents in the home and in many cases without opportunities and supervision.  Some ""boneheaded"" ideas promulgated by school-systems across the country involve letting them further run wild in school as a means of being ""sensitive"" to slavery and Jim Crow.  I don't know of any school aged children who have been slaves or through ""Jim Crow"" laws.  What this allows are children who grow up without the skills and discipline which make it possible to be a success in society.  Bottom line, when they act out in society with the same tactics that the 'sensitive"" administrators allowed in school, they might wind up in jail.  

So, when you have such a small sliver of the population committing crimes or getting ""locked up"", it mathematically leaves a smaller proportion, after other career fields are considered, left to join the police force.  It is NOT the ""fault"" of ""stop and frisk"" that these people have received ""police records"".......  If the ""stop and frisk"" resulted in ""nothing""...... there would likely be no arrest.

In an August 2013, Sentencing Project report on Racial Disparities in the United States Criminal Justice System, submitted to the United Nations, ""one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime"".  And it gets worse......

Several studies have concluded that overall, more black males are in prison than are enrolled in colleges and universities. In 2000 there were 791,600 black men in prison and 603,032 enrolled in college versus 1980, when there were 143,000 black men in prison and 463,700 enrolled in college.  So it appears to be getting worse over time.....  

A new release as September 2012 from Schott Foundation finds only 52% of Black males graduate from high school.  In our ""knowledge based society"", this often excludes them from finding meaningful and gainful employment which might essentially lead many to crime.  The three top crimes?  (1) Drug offenses; (2) Person Offenses; (3) Property Offenses.  According to one writer, ""there are more African American men incarcerated in the U.S. than the total prison populations in India, Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Japan, Germany, Finland, Israel and England combined.""  And this is out of a population of approximately 19 million Black men in the United States.  

Is the answer to ""decriminalize"" certain offenses such as drugs?  Um... no..... the point is that this is a manner in which money is made.  Wouldn't the other crimes go up as a result?  

The reality of this ""truth"" is that unless we identify and address the problem, it only get's worse.... it does not go away.  In the face of such rabid deniers and the PC police, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, is the one deserving the description of ""Brave"".",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/852566734824119/?type=3,2015-06-10 10:23:47,27,7,23,27,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_852506501496809,"Happy Birthday Hattie McDaniel!!!!

The Original Trailblazer......

Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1895 – October 26, 1952) was an American actress, singer-songwriter, and comedienne. She is best known for her role as Mammy in Gone with the Wind (1939) for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, making her the first African American to win an Academy Award.

In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a professional singer-songwriter, comedian, stage actress, radio performer, and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on the radio in the U.S.During her career, McDaniel appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so.

McDaniel has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Hollywood: one at 6933 Hollywood Boulevard for her contributions to radio and one at 1719 Vine Street for acting in motion pictures. In 1975, she was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame and in 2006 became the first black Oscar winner honored with a US postage stamp.

Hattie McDaniel was born June 10, 1895, in Wichita, Kansas, to former slaves. She was the youngest of 13 children. Her father, Henry McDaniel, fought in the Civil War with the 122nd USCT and her mother, Susan Holbert, was a singer of religious music.

In 1900, the family moved to Colorado, living first in Fort Collins and then in Denver, where Hattie graduated from Denver East High School. Her brother, Sam McDaniel (1886–1962), played the butler in the 1948 Three Stooges' short film Heavenly Daze. Another acting sibling of Hattie and Sam was actor Etta McDaniel.

In addition to performing, Hattie was also a songwriter, a skill she honed while working with her brother's minstrel show. After the death of her brother Otis in 1916, the troupe began to lose money, and it wasn't until 1920 that Hattie got her next big break. During 1920–25, she appeared with Professor George Morrison's Melody Hounds, a touring black ensemble, and in the mid-1920s she embarked on a radio career, singing with the Melody Hounds on station KOA in Denver. In 1926–1929 she also recorded many of her songs on Okeh Recordsand Paramount Records[8] in Chicago. In all, McDaniel recorded seven sessions; one in the summer of 1926 on the rare Kansas City label Meritt; four sessions in Chicago for Okeh (late 1926-late 1927) – of the ten sides, only four were issued, and two sessions in Chicago for Paramount (both in March 1929).

When the stock market crashed in 1929, the only work McDaniel could find was as a wash-room attendant and waitress at Club Madrid in Milwaukee. Despite the owner's reluctance to let her perform, McDaniel was eventually allowed to take the stage and she soon became a regular.

After Show Boat she had major roles in MGM's Saratoga (1937), starring Jean Harlow and Clark Gable, The Shopworn Angel (1938) with Margaret Sullavan, and The Mad Miss Manton (1938), starring Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. She had a very minor role in the Carole Lombard/Frederic March vehicle, Nothing Sacred (1937), in which she appeared as the wife of a shoeshine man (Troy Brown), masquerading as a sultan.

McDaniel was a friend of many of Hollywood's most popular stars, including Joan Crawford, Tallulah Bankhead, Bette Davis, Shirley Temple, Henry Fonda, Ronald Reagan, Olivia de Havilland, and Clark Gable. She would star with de Havilland and Gable in Gone with the Wind (1939).

She was constantly criticized  by members of the black community for the roles she chose to accept and for her decision to pursue roles aggressively rather than rock the Hollywood boat.. Groups such as the NAACP despised her for accepting the roles offered because she played often the maid.  They referred to her as an ""Uncle Tom"".  She was not associated with civil rights protests and she did not join the Negro Actors Guild of America until 1947, very late in her career.   McDaniel hired one of the few white agents who would represent black actors in those days, William Meiklejohn, to advance her career. realizing that she had to ""play the game first, so that she could make a difference later. ""  Right or wrong, it was her decision and she was a very successful and shrewd businesswoman.  Even though she was given accolades for her speech when accepting the academy award, she had to sit with her family at a sectioned off table apart from the other actors.  

Hedda Hopper once said that most of McDaniel's career woes came not from the whites but the Blacks undermining and criticizing her at every turn for not being more of a force for civil rights.  She gained a reputation for generosity, lending money to friends and strangers alike regardless of their race.....

She won the right to purchase a white two-story, seventeen-room house in 1942. The house included a large living room, dining room, drawing room, den, butler's pantry, kitchen, service porch, library, four bedrooms and a basement. McDaniel had a yearly Hollywood party. Everyone knew that the king of Hollywood, Clark Gable, could always be found at McDaniel's parties.

The home was in the development of West Adams Heights which had , back in 1902, had a covenant  which restricted ""Non-Caucasians"" from owning property. For seven years they had tried to enforce it, but failed. Then they went to court....

Superior Judge Thurmond Clarke decided to visit the disputed ground—popularly known as ""Sugar Hill."" ... Next morning, ... Judge Clarke threw the case out of court. His reason: ""It is time that members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed them under the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

Never the ""rabble-grouser""  she simply told the reporters:  ""Words cannot express my appreciation.""

She died of breast cancer in 1952 at the age of 57.  Thousands of mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements. In her will, McDaniel wrote: ""I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias in my hair and in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses. I also wish to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery.""  

The Hollywood Cemetery on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood is the resting place of movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino, and others. Hollywood Cemetery refused to allow her to be buried there, because it, too, practiced racial segregation and would not accept for burial the bodies of black people. Her second choice was Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, where she lies today

McDaniel's last will and testament of December 1951 awarded her Oscar to Howard University, where she had been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar.The whereabouts of the McDaniel Oscar are currently unknown. It has been reported that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry Black civil rights protesters in the 1960s.  

Just a few of her quotes:

""Always remember this: There are only eighteen inches between a pat on the back and a kick in the rump.""

""Why should I complain about making $700 a week playing a maid? If I didn't, I'd be making $7 a week being one.""

""I sincerely hope that I shall always be a credit to my race, and to the motion picture industry.""

""I did my best, and God did the rest.""",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/852506311496828/?type=3,2015-06-10 06:53:10,95,14,22,95,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_851509988263127,"Today in:  1947 - ""Lassie Show"" debuted on ABC radio. It was a 15-minute show.

The New Lassie (television)

Lassie is an American television series that follows the adventures of a female Rough Collie dog named Lassie and her companions, both human and animal. The show was the creation of producer Robert Maxwell and animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax and was televised from September 12, 1954, to March 25, 1973. The fourth longest-running U.S. primetime television series after The Simpsons, Gunsmoke, and Law & Order, the show chalked up 17 seasons on CBS before entering first-run syndication for its final two seasons. Initially filmed in black and white, the show transitioned to color in 1965.

The show's first 10 seasons follow Lassie's adventures in a small farming community. Fictional eleven-year-old Jeff Miller, his mother, and his grandfather are Lassie's first human companions until seven-year-old Timmy Martin and his adoptive parents take over in the fourth season. When Lassie's exploits on the farm end in the eleventh season, she finds new adventures in the wilderness alongside United States Forest Service Rangers. After traveling on her own for a year, Lassie finally settles at a children's home for her final two syndicated seasons.

Lassie received critical favor at its debut and won two Emmy Awards in its first years. Stars Jan Clayton and June Lockhart were nominated for Emmys. Merchandise produced during the show's run included books, a Halloween costume, clothing, toys, and other items. Campbell's Soup, the show's lifelong sponsor, offered two premiums (a ring and a wallet), and distributed thousands to fans. A multi-part episode was edited into the feature film Lassie's Great Adventure and released in August 1963. Selected episodes have been released to DVD.

428053320608798_851504888263637,"Good Monday Afternoon!

Affirmative Action….. is it ever fair?

The United States is supposed to be a ""melting pot"".  A country made up of many different people, with  variations in lifestyles, faiths, religions, races and backgrounds all ""melting"" together into what can be considered a harmonious whole, one ""pot"" of people living together under a common culture, a common set of patriotic values.  Those proponents of multiculturalism, emphasize a fusion of cultures  which maintain and celebrate elements of their own unique culture.  

Why is the idea of a ""melting pot"" important?  Because it stresses the ideals that we as a nation have ""in common"" with each other rather than the differences.  Much of the assimilation between cultures occur through befriending, community and intermarriage between the various members of society.  African-Americans are fully culturally integrated into American culture and institutions, however,  more than a century after the abolition of slavery, intermarriage between African-Americans and other ethnicities is much less common than between different white ethnicities, or between white and Asian ethnicities. Intermarriage between whites and non-whites, and especially African-Americans, has long been a taboo in the United States, and was illegal in many states  until 1967.  For this reason, and many other economic ones as well, African Americans have not been able to fully participate in the ""melting pot"" of America.

Affirmative Action is the policy of favoring members of a disadvantaged group who suffer from discrimination within a culture, many call it ""positive discrimination"", however, that seems a bit of an oxymoron.    Rather it is a way of favoring members of a disadvantaged group who suffer from discrimination within a culture.  This is seen as the remedy for those who have been left out of the ""melting pot"".  Affirmative action in the United States tends to focus on issues such as education and employment, specifically granting special consideration to racial minorities and women who have been historically disadvantaged in terms of education and employment.    

There are now a couple of ""new twists"" that I would like to discuss…..  If you go to HarvardNotFair.org, you'll find yourself on a page that says this: Were You Denied Admission to Harvard? It may be because you're the wrong race.  OK……. A lot of people DON""T get into Harvard.  The competition is stiff, and there are many facets to getting accepted….  This site is curtesy of ""The Project for Fair Representation"" .   Edward Blum previously backed Fisher v. Texas, an affirmative action case that was brought before the Supreme Court in 2012. In that case, Abigail Fisher, a white woman, claimed she was denied admission to the school, while lesser-qualified blacks and Latinos got in because of affirmative action. (The Supreme Court sent the case back to a lower court for further review, and it's still going through the appeals process.)
This case and a few others involving the top level schools are making the argument that affirmative action policies don't just hurt whites; they also hurt Asian-Americans, maybe even more so.  Schools should try to achieve racial diversity –  but not in a manner that would disadvantage other students by holding them to a different standard based upon the color of skin.

The lawsuit filed against Harvard cites an Asian-American student who was denied admission despite being valedictorian of a competitive high school, achieving a perfect ACT score and a perfect score of 800 on two of the SAT II subject exams, and participating in numerous extracurricular and volunteer activities. The applicant, the lawsuit states, was ""denied the opportunity to compete for admission to Harvard on equal footing with other applicants"" due to his race.

Many Asian students are offended and feel that they are ""disadvantaged""  by the stereotype that paints them all as over-achieving and affluent.  The truth is, however, that as a ""minority group"" .  As a whole,  they can boast the highest high school graduation rate of any race in the country.  Princeton researcher Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Walton Radford of RTI International found that Asian-identified students had to score 140 points higher on their SATs to gain admission to prestigious colleges compared to white students.

So, if we are to restore our republic to ""the shining city on the hill"", is it wise to punish success?  Because that is what we are doing when we socially engineer the winners and the losers based upon something as benign as the ""skin color"".  The myth that most Asians are affluent with exceedingly high IQ's is simply that … a myth.  I have been a host to two Chinese exchange students over the past four years.  They work hard, even though by Chinese standards both students were from affluent homes, the goal was to make the ""family proud"" and not bring shame by returning to their country ""unaccomplished"".  My first Chinese daughter, Lynn, scored 700 on the math portion of the SAT, her parents were beside themselves with anger and over the next few weeks she received tutoring over the internet  and pamphlets to help her get a ""better score"".  The next score was ""perfect"".  My manicurist is from Viet Nam.  He and his wife do manicures and pedicures seven days a week in their shop to keep their two sons in the most expensive private school in South Florida – the total cost $47,000 per year.  All he talks about are the grades and he will pull out their grade report to show everybody.  On the weekends, they come to the shop to clean up.  And then they (the sons) ""hang out with friends"" and play games like golf, the  parents always seem apprehensive about that and the father told me he does not like it but they have to ""do that in America"" to become American.  
  
Perhaps, they are the winners in the equation, after all.  At the end of the day the stereotypes and assumptions provide them with the esteem that they need to keep meeting and exceeding expectations.    The door swings both ways……",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/851504644930328/?type=3,2015-06-08 14:04:26,8,1,17,8,0,0,0,0,0

When my youngest daughter was 11 I thought that she would look cute with a ""pixie"" cut.  She went along with it and she looked like a very young Halle Berry or Season Hubley.  She has really cute small features and it was so very fashionable.  One problem, she is really small and while I thought it was fashionable she endured a lot of teasing at school.  They would pretend to line up the boys on one side and the girls on the other and pretend that did not remember she was a girl for example..... I was wrong and I was selfish.  Her hair is now 3 feet  long and she is allergic to hair cutting and I oblige.  I say this to mean that shaming a child is wrong but shaming by cutting their hair is awful.

The Return of Rick Perry!

It was hot, very hot in the hangar but one thing is certain..... Rick Perry supporters do make a compelling point:with the following statement::  

""Imagine a president who's worn the uniform and knows what it's like to serve,"" retired Navy SEAL Pete Scobell told a crowd of Rick Perry supporters Thursday as they waited for the former Texas governor to announce his second run for the presidency in a stifling hot airplane hangar.""

Imagine that.  Imagine how different the state of the Middle East would be without the chaos that ensued after the completely chaotic foreign policy gaffes of the current president and his administration.  Imagine a better response in Benghazi, the misreading of the so-called ""Arab Spring"" which subsequently heralded in the rise of ISIS or ISIL....... Imagine that Iraq would not be lost and Syria would not be on the verge of being lost.  Imagine that several respected generals and advisers would still have been available to give their very valuable advice.  Imagine that 5 Taliban ""superstars"" would not have been swapped for a low life deserter by the name of Beau Bergdahl and imagine that his mother in her sprightly spring frock and dad in his big Tali-beard would not have been on hand to deliver a message in a middle eastern dialect.

Imagine..... a domestic policy that would not have included race riots with fictitious stories such as ""hands up don't shoot"".  Imagine the  United States without the urban strife that would produce a young Mike Nifong in the form of a Prosecutor by the name of Mosby who at this very moment is scrambling to put together a case that won't blow up in her face by suppressing evidence from an autopsy.  Imagine her not standing on television delivering an INSANE speech about her being a crusader for the rioters who's ""time has come"" and then has her mother text something about her name being headed for ""stars"" while she jumps on stage with Prince.  Imagine Baltimore without the animus towards police that has turned it into a place where for the month of May there were 42 homicides and violent crime is on the ""upswing"" ----- it was already up.... how much higher can it go?

Imagine a country without Al Sharpton as a presidential level adviser. or where a curious woman who is also a State Department spokesperson - Marie Harf',  asserts that all the terrorists need to stop attacking are jobs and the ability to get small business loans to start small shops and those who don't understand this are not as smart as she is..

Imagine no Obamacare with all of its upcoming ""surprises"".  These surprises don't include anything more than more money out of your pocket; 

Just imagine.....  the daydream rather than the nightmare to come unless we get this next election right.  

We have a great field of candidates, very capable of correcting the very tough situation in America.

Imagine.....A country of ""Americans""...... not hyphenated Americans divided by gender, race, color, religion, income, class, etc....... at least in terms of direction.

After spending most of the morning responding to constant assaults regarding the Duggar family, I realize that many people no longer question, they advocate.  As long as I am writing about the ills of the left, Black people, Hispanics, the ghetto or illegal immigrants, it is golden.  But the minute the shortcomings of what many consider sacred, then the ""disappointment"" begins and the attacks start.

Sorry, that some of you feel that way, but when I see something that does not ring true...... I am going to speak out.  It is a sad state of affairs that some of you can not fathom how terrible it is that an adolescent boy ""fondle"" or fiddle with his sister or any other young girl.  Not once, not twice but three times.  It was like he was compelled.  We must get smarter than that.  

 Jim Bob Duggar finally reported Josh's conduct to State Trooper Joseph Hutchens. Hutchens, who is currently serving a 56-year prison sentence for child pornography, claims that Jim Bob lied to him. According to Hutchens, Jim Bob said that there was only a single instance of Josh molesting one of his sisters.

Hutchens never filed a formal report. By the time police got wind of the incidents again, the statute of limitations had expired.

I understand that many of you are defending them from a ""place of hurt"" because many have either endured abuse or know someone who has.  I advocate for them.  No-one is considering the girls.  

As for ""counseling"", that story has changed also:

Jim Bob reportedly told church elders — and presumably the police — that Josh was sent in 2003 to a Christian program with ""hard physical work and counseling."" Michelle later told the police that ""Josh did not receive counseling and instead had been sent during that time to a family friend who was in the home remodeling business."" 

Sorry.....  re-doing a kitchen is not the same as curbing compulsions.  The posted story was not about the Duggars per se but about the millions of girls suffering in silence and bringing that hurt to adulthood.  I think much of the discussion came from a place of hurt.  No one even noticed the theme of discernment.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/848723088541817/?type=3,2015-06-04 13:01:45,134,39,7,134,0,0,0,0,0

The Duggars , the Interview and the Girls.....

(Please read before commenting)

There is always vitriol and curious anger surrounding any discussion of the Duggar family.  This comes both from the left and the right since I deal with both on a daily basis.  I have never had any feelings one way or the other because I am part of a very large family and I really felt that it was none of anyone's business how many children a family decides to produce as long as they are able to take responsible care of each of the members.  Personally, Allen and I felt that our top level was two and that was all we had ---- two children and that too was our own business and what was right for us.  

But this story was different.

No doubt so many people have formulated their defense prior to hearing anything about this family as well as there are those who are ""bloodthirsty"" in their ""aha"" moment. but once again this story is different.  Personally, I have always been suspicious of any family or movement that removes the individual from utilizing the very gift from God, and that is discernment.  Discernment: is the heightened ability to read or hear a teaching, to encounter a problem, or to consider a proposed course of action, and then determine whether the source behind the teaching, problem, or action is divine, merely human, or satanic.

The Duggars, by their very prolific gift for producing children, have been able to singularly produce their own school house of children.  They home-school (which can be a good thing), they associate with like minded people and they attempt to marry off their young to people with like minded characteristics.  Their days are spent centered around the family and the often grueling aspects, at least for the girls, of filling every waking hour with tending for younger siblings.  Believe me, that is not easy for a child.  My mother often thanks me for babysitting my younger siblings.......  sometimes for 8 to 10 hours a day because of work and commuting schedules.  By the time I was 10 years old, I was able to cook a meal, clean a house and care for up to 4 younger siblings at a time.  Don't get me wrong, we had an enormous amount of fun but it came at the cost of a carefree girlhood.  But my mother and father worked and I was the responsible one so it was what it was.  I have no regrets because it made ma a responsible, flexible and decisive person.  But it was...... sometimes overwhelming.  And I only had four to look out for at a time.  Imagine nineteen siblings with no end in sight.....

The good thing is that we had options.  We lived in a fairly urbanized area and we were able to interact with various characters in the neighborhood, organize impromptu baseball or marble tournaments and fairly well develop that ""gift of discernment"".  We knew which girls and boys were doing ""the nasty""; who was using drugs or alcohol, .... basically as we settled into our routine in each city of our very frequent moves due to my father being in the military.  We had our own cohorts and almost separate lives from that of our parents.  We were able to essentially interact with the leaders of the local girls and boys club where we spent many, many  hours playing pool, cards, watching movies and just jiving around.  In doing that we discovered societal norms and incorporated them into our core values.  We found out what church bus was going to what church and chose to take the ones, on a rotating basis  that served the free potluck.  God's Word was important but so was the enchilada casserole, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese  and blueberry pie (smile).

No back to the Duggars.....  They had few options - especially the young girls.  Last night as I watched the interview.... three times, I noticed one overarching theme......  The need to protect Josh, the eldest of their children.  In a patriarchal home the father and subsequently the male children are very, very important. The girls are prettied up in the face and hair division (then covered from head to toe) , the boys are given ""free reign"" and wear what they want.   The girls work in the home, the boys play hard.  So back to the interview.....The mother Michelle, in her whispery, child-like voice, (Austen and Aubrey asked why she spoke that way), asserted that the girls did not even know what happened to them until the newspapers reveled the information .... they slept through the entire ""fondling"" ordeal on the many occasions that it occurred.  I wonder if anyone ever asked the girls about their recollection of the events or whether it was ever important enough for them to do so.  Another thing that came through was the forced crying on Michelle's part, and the father --- Jim Bob's constant round trip to the legalities of a possible lawsuit, who leaked the information and so forth.  They do not share power in this relationship.  

The two girls who will be interviewed tomorrow are the ones that have been married off and are now mothers themselves.  From the previews, both of them are humiliated ... one more than the other.  The one that seems the most upset has fingernails that appear to be eaten to the quick.  The one is very, very attractive and a bit more spunky.  One of the greatest tragedies of this episode is that neither of them can really fathom that they are not alone.  Neither of them can fathom that instead of being angry at who ""outed"" the information, they should be grateful that someone had the courage to expose this terrible episode of not only the molestation but the lack of empathy and respect for their feelings displayed by not only the community around them but by their parents as well.  Harboring such a terrible secret, why would the parents allow this type of program to go forth and why were they so isolated from others that their own spirit of discernment not able to develop?  

We don't know much about the ""missing"" family members in the parent's respective ""trees"".  They are not spoken about and I suspect that they are not of the same mind.  Don't get me wrong, a large family is a Blessing, I would not trade any of my experiences nor any of my siblings for anything in the world.  We fight, yes, but each of them have contributed so very much to the fabric of my life that I am eternally Grateful for the journey, however, in my growing up home --- we were not under ""strict rule"", we watched what we wanted, had friends, stayed out of trouble, went to church ---- and attended school with people of minds that were not like ours.  Our children are loaned to us as a gift,   we as parents are tasked with teaching, guiding and counselling.  When we indoctrinate, we take away the natural gifts .... one being discernment that God bestows upon us.  We assume that ""we"" know better and ""we"" are inherently better than the Will of God.  But we all mercifully pass away and we leave on this earth the fruits of our being, we should prepare them by polishing the diamond in the rough and showing off its many capabilities ---- male or female.

I am personally glad, for the children's sake, that this program is coming to a close.  They need to heal.  We should not showcase our children until the job is finished, they need the room to grow outside of the scrutiny of the ""madding crowd"" who bring with them their own baggage for scrutiny.  I hope that the Duggar parents seek a measure of humility and true guidance of the full love of the Lord.  I also pray that Josh gets the help that he will need and the counselling that he will need.  Normal adolescent boys of 15 don't view their 5 year old sister as a possible sexual mate, this is often a ""learned"" response.  The ""devil"" didn't make him do it.....  There is a ""chip"" missing somewhere and the fact that he has young children concerns me.

The High Cost of Victimhood

Yesterday, I was appalled to read in a comment a little rant from someone who should know better.  He claimed that the problems in Baltimore were as a result of the ""white police state"" and that Baltimore is now ""reaping what was sowed"".  Apparently this was a stab at the so-called ""white establishment"" who  ""really runs"" Baltimore or any other city in which a policeman/woman has either been involved with or the direct cause of the death of a black man.  This same tone was repeated over and over by one news station after another parading a number of people Black and White with their own version of ""what is wrong""  with life in the inner city and why Black men are killing each other in greater numbers than you can even imagine.  

The enduring theme is that ""someone is making them do it"", and if just a little more money, just a little more mentoring  or just a little more of this or that or a little less police interference or ….   WALLAH! Things will change.  Crime will go down , everyone will be self-actualized and life will be good…….   Another very preposterous suggestion this morning was that we begin to pay money to the people NOT to kill each other or behave badly.  All of these suggestions and the anecdotes to bad behavior is about as effective as a vaccine for the common cold.  Sometimes the answers we seek are the ones we do not want to hear because they are painful.  

Many of us can remember the first class of Psychology, a required course for University studies.  One of the first explanations for human behavior was explained by ""Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs"".    Maslow (1943) stated that people are motivated to achieve certain needs. When one need is fulfilled a person seeks to fulfil the next one, and so on.    Let me review this model:

1.  Biological and Physiological needs - air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, sleep.
2.  Safety needs - protection from elements, security, order, law, stability, freedom from fear.
3. Love and belongingness needs - friendship, intimacy, affection and love, - from work group, family, friends, romantic relationships.
4. Esteem needs - achievement, mastery, independence, status, dominance, prestige, self-respect, respect from others.
5. Self-Actualization needs - realizing personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences.

When I watch the interviews, the common theme among the apologists and those seeking fame, fortune and other personal political and monetary elevation through their suggestions for the madness engulfing the inner city, is to move directly to ""building esteem or elevating personal growth"" of the Black male who, for some reason is suffering from the after-effects of slavery, Jim Crow, and the oppression of ""DA"" Man. 

This is all total ""poppycock"".

A child raised without the stability of a home, which often necessitates more than a single parent struggling to survive; without the benefits of good nutrition; safety and protection from abuse (either physical or sexual);  without the benefits of a warm environment of friendship, kinship, and other formal or informal relationships that foster a feeling of warmth and acceptance will have a ""damaged"" psyche.  Granted, there are always exceptions to this rule, some personalities are so phlegmatic or needy that they naturally don't respond to these entreaties but this is more the exception than the rule.  And the opposite is true also.  You might find a success story here and there that will illustrate the child raised in extreme deprivation that will respond positively to ""self-actualization"" types of remedies, but I assert that the is not going to work over large swathes of the population.

The Corner is a 2000 HBO drama television miniseries based on the true story"" The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood"" by David Simon and Ed Burns and adapted for television by Simon and David Mills. It premiered on premium cable network HBO in the United States on April 16, 2000, and concluded its six-part run on May 21, 2000. 

Guess what city the story highlighted?  None other than Baltimore.  The location?  The same as the riots. The Corner tells the story the life of a family living in poverty amid the open-air drug markets of West Baltimore. ""The corner"" is at the junction of West Fayette Street and North Monroe Street.  Fifteen years ago and nothing changed for the better and much for the worse.
It centers mostly around the lives of Gary McCullough (he had dreams of a good life but dropped out of college and gradually became a drug addict), his ex-wife Fran Boyd, also an addict, and their son DeAndre McCullough, a high school student who begins to sell drugs.  It was a difficult program to watch and I did one time, I just could not subject myself to a second round.  I suppose the saddest creature in the book was Gary, who tried his very best but had no foundation to support his dreams of a ""better life"".  The rest of the characters never had a chance because their lives were based on such shaky ground,  however, I understand that the mother, Fran, found her way out.   

DeAndre finally succumbed to drug addiction even after many, many chances and much money thrown at his problems.  DeAndre went clean for a number of years and even had a minor role The Wire. However, on August 1, 2012, he was found dead at the age of 35, from a drug overdose.  The money, fame and overtures for self-actualization will not work when the soul is empty.

So what is the high cost of opportunistic political leadership, throwing money at self-actualization types of training as stupid ad elitist as  the  ""boneheaded"" St. Paul school district which began a contractual relationship with the Pacific Educational Group, a San Francisco-based organization that tries to help public schools deal with achievement and disciplinary issues involving black students. ----- they spent over two million dollars in 5 years when they could have had classes in parenting, started athletic programs, and community groups for much less.    

And what was the result of this asinine training in St. Paul?   Becky McQueen, an educator at St. Paul's Harding High School, was beaten around the head and ears by strong high-school basketball players after trying to stop a fight.  The ""kid"" was only sent home for a couple of days, after all she is just a ""white lady"" and probably deserved it because of slavery or Jim Crow or ….
And the targeting of Ms. McQueen continued…. ""Yet another student who repeatedly drops into her class has hit kids and cursed at an aide, once telling McQueen he would ""fry"" her ass. She tried to make a joke of it — 'Ooh, I could use a little weight loss.' Her students interjected: 'No, that means he's gonna kill you.'""  I guess her ""white self"" did not know the thug lingo.
McQueen now has her students use a secret knock on the classroom door, so she will know who to allow in.

So, that is the real cost, young black people who do not know the boundaries of civilized society will be released into a society that will show them in quick fashion that they will not be as tolerant.  Lest you  think that this is an unusual situation, my friend was pinched on the breast by an 11th grader she was teaching.  The school refused to hear it, but called a meeting with the father after a repeated incident where he tried to grope her.  The father's response to my friend?  ""You sure are one pretty white woman, he couldn't help himself"".  

Wanna bet the kid will pay a price in the future?  Pay now or pay later.  Equality means paying the ""equal "" price for your goods, for your life, for your actions.  No more excuses for bad behavior.  I suppose the posting I wrote about at the beginning of this story was correct, we are ""reaping what we have sowed"".  And the ""chickens""  are coming home to roost…….. they are in the ""killing fields"" of West Baltimore, Chicago, New York and most major cities where over the past 35 years in America, an estimated 324,000 blacks have been killed at the hands of fellow blacks, proving ""racist"" white cops are the least of their worries; Minority women constitute only about 13% of the female population (age 15-44) in the United States, but they underwent approximately 36% of the abortions. On average, 1,876 black babies are aborted every day in the United States;  and ""more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock.""

Yes…. The ""chickens are coming home to roost""……. They are killing each other and rioting to please the very people who should be helping them……. With the truth……. That change and betterment will begin from within and until this fact is digested, there will be a high price to pay…. A very high one  especially when the killing fields spread their territory.... the gated communities in which they formulate their theories and the private schools where they protect their young.

428053320608798_839044116176381,"Good Thursday Morning!

 Easter, Christmas, weddings or funerals.

Last week I received an article claiming that although the ""U.S. has a reputation for being exceptionally religious—and it is true that, historically speaking, churchgoing has played an outsized role in American identity. Still, millions of Americans have little to no connection to local congregations.""

Although I could write about a plethora of other issues, this one most directly speaks to the changing culture of American society.  Currently, 38 percent of adults have not attended a church service, except for a holiday or special occasion, at any time within the past six months.""Unchurched adults include ""dechurched""—that is, those who used to attend regularly but have not attended at all in the past six months—and ""never churched""—meaning they have never in their lives regularly attended a church.  The article goes on to say:

While San Francisco is number one overall when it comes to churchless residents, it ranks sixth on the never-churched list (14%), outpaced by:

.  West Palm Beach-Ft. Pierce, FL (17%)
.  Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-San Luis Obispo, CA (16%)
.  New York, NY (15%)
.  Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen, TX (15%)
.  Chico-Redding, CA (15%)
http://cities.barna.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bu-042215-ig-6.jpg

The first entry, ""West Palm Beach-Ft. Pierce, FL"" is exactly where I live. After doing some research I found out that a 2008 Gallup poll comparing belief in God among U.S. regions found that only 59% of residents in the Western United States believe in a god, compared to 80% in the East, 83% in the Midwest, and 86% in the South.  The poll also showed that Oregon ranked as the state with the highest percentage of residents identifying with ""No religion, Atheist, or Agnostic"", at 24.6%.

In addition, according to a Pew report. the proportion of Jews who say they have no religion and are Jewish only on the basis of ancestry, ethnicity or culture is growing rapidly, and two-thirds of them are not raising their children Jewish at all.Among Jewish denominations, the Reform movement remains the largest: 35 percent of respondents identified as Reform, according to the Pew study. The second-largest group is Jews of no denomination (30 percent), followed by Conservative (18 percent) and Orthodox (10 percent).

So..... what does this mean? In a spiritual realm. agree or disagree with me if you like, people seem meaner, lost and smaller.  Unfortunately for those who believe that God is some ""made up fairytale in the sky"",most human beings find the world a bit too big and too complicated to rely upon their own understanding and will seek other, perhaps more destructive means, of coping with hurt, pain , betrayal, loss or bewilderment. Among our youth, we have read reports of them running away from perfectly comfortable middle class homes to go to the barren desert and fight against these wonderful ""creature comforts"" to fight against their own country... and their own seeming great advantages.  Although these occurrences are relatively rare,  the movement towards the legalization of drugs and the disproportionate level of disaffection with seemingly common ""rules"" of society is not.  The reliance upon prescription drugs to make us ""happy"" and able to ""cope"" is another boondoggle. Adults who used to ""say a little prayer"" are now reaching for the Xanax.

Among other things, the reliance upon the belief of a ""higher being"" provides us with the framework for morality, for decency, for treating others.  They provide the ""rules"" for an orderly, respectful and 'livable"" society.  When these walls break down, we witness Baltimore, where the mayor had no concept of personal property, no regard for safety, no wisdom to know the limits of a population so far from the center of society that they could not control the urges to destroy their OWN backyard, shelter and safety.   

Human beings are NOT inherently moral creatures.  They are intelligent, but not inherently moral. We are not inherently brave, not inherently unselfish.  Being a Christian, I understand the evils of the world. We all give in to sin, we all fall, and we all fail. 
Children are good examples. They have not yet defined their beliefs and act on nature rather than what is right. Children are taught to act a certain manner, it is not a natural state that a child  comes into the world knowing what is right and wrong; just as an animal does not have a bit of compassion for a member of its own species, it thinks of the other as a competitor and not as a friend. 

Man/Woman by nature does not choose to be moral, we would rather choose to run around and sleep with every woman/man/boy/girl/baby or whatever before settling with a partner. We would rather murder our rival than choose to love him its easier. We would prefer lying than to tell the truth it's easier and will satisfy many more people....... make us popular. BUT religion tells us to do otherwise. It tells us to be patient and faithful, withholding our bodies from giving in. It tells us to not only love our enemies but care for them, go the extra mile to change their lives. It tells us to defeat the evil within and become better than good but perfect... or at least try.

Without the framework, how would our laws come into being?  We are here in time for what amounts to a 'blink of an eye"", how could we consider the fashioning of laws based upon the 10 Commandments which would not exist without religiosity.

But, Angela, more people have died in the name of religion than not.... right?  Don't know, what I do know is that in the absence of religion there would be some type of ideology that would have created the same wars, the same deaths and probably much more.  The deaths under Communism and socialism are legion, regardless of the current amorous flirtation going on with these utopian ideals.  

We can become disillusioned by the religious leader, the grasping/greedy proselytizer who exploits the sadness and poverty (either in spirit or wealth) of his congregation and implores them to provide him with a 65 million dollar jet and Rolls Royces and other luxury play-toys.  The stylish ""preacher-dudes"" who possess personal  lifestyles dirtier than any prostitute, or criminal flashes on every billboard, enticing you with promises of sexual discussions from the pulpit.  On a smaller note, we get saddened when the head of the marriage initiative has an affair with the head of the Christian school. We feel betrayed and say to ourselves ""religion is full of hypocrites"".  Nope it is just full of people, just like you and me.... satisfying their immediate and profane wants, needs and desires.....  

But these are just the messengers and they are purposefully flawed to illustrate that man will fall short, very short of the glory and perfection..... and we love the messenger anyways.  He/she is one of us.

The politician (especially those running for President) will likely have to acknowledge, however, in this next election that the ""evangelical"" vote might not be enough to get them over the ""hump"".  People sometimes confuse the messenger with the message, so they are not receptive to heavy doctrine.  But never give up, even the ""Easter, Christmas, weddings or funerals"" people - (change the holiday terminology for each religion), inherently understand that values, morality and the survival of society will depend upon the constancy of the ""guiding hand"" that moves us towards what is right and away from what is truly destructive both personally and nationwide.

Her Eyes are Watching Duke Lacrosse....

The Maryland state's attorney whose activist comments and alleged conflicts of interest have become a central part of the Freddie Gray case, appeared on stage at a Prince concert Sunday as the musician performed a protest song about Gray and the recent unrest in Baltimore.

Marilyn Mosby and her husband Nick Mosby, a Baltimore city councilman, sat on a couch on stage during Prince's ""Rally 4 Peace"" benefit concert, according to the Baltimore Sun.  

So what was said at this ""get together""?

""Nobody got in nobody's way, so I guess you could say it was a good day, at least a little better than the day in Baltimore. Does anybody hear us pray, for Michael Brown or Freddie Gray? Peace is more than the absence of a war,"" the song goes.

""If there ain't no justice than there ain't no peace,"" it continues.

""The system is broken,"" Prince told the audience, according to the Sun. ""It's going to take the young people to fix it this time. We need new ideas, new life.""

While Mosby did not speak to the audience during the concert, her appearance comes just two days after the cops in the case filed motions of dismissal and recusal. The officers claim that Mosby has several personal, political and professional conflicts of interest and that she should remove herself from the case and allow a special prosecutor to take over.

According to the Sun, Mosby's husband gave her the tickets for the concert as a Mother's Day gift.

Even before appearing on stage with Prince Sunday, Mosby has been accused of making statements that were seen as prejudiced against the criminal justice system.

""I heard your call for 'no justice, no peace,'"" Mosby said when she announced charges against the officers.

Kind of interesting words for a prosecutor, now....... does it sound ""unbiased to you?""

In the infamous Duke lacrosse case, there was no rape or kidnapping and the real scandal was the baseless prosecution by Mike Nifong, an opportunistic white man then serving by appointment as district attorney in Durham, North Carolina and willing to pander to black voters in a Democrat primary in order to win election and keep his job, the prosecution of six Baltimore police officers by Marilyn Mosby, a young black female who became Baltimore state attorney earlier this year after winning a Democrat primary against a white male incumbent last year and the wife of Baltimore councilman Nick Mosby, seemed to be an egregious abuse of power by a politically motivated person.

Meanwhile........Richard Fletcher was attacked by nearly 50 teens in broad daylight on April 22, after he intervened when two girls began fighting on his truck. Dundalk sits on the edge of Baltimore, and many of the teenagers are believed to be students at Baltimore Community High School.

The gruesome beating left Fletcher with extensive injuries and a medical bill expected to exceed $200,000. He suffered broken eye sockets, a broken nose, broken ribs and bleeding on the brain.

New cell phone video of the attack shows dozens of teens kicking, punching, and stomping Fletcher as he lay motionless in the middle of the street.

Will he get the ""justice or peace"" that Mosby is speaking of?  Probably not.

Baltimore's ""plucky young state's attorney"" Marilyn Mosby reportedly sent a text message to her mother.

""Heads up,"" Mosby wrote. ""National media is focusing on me.""

""You'll be all right,"" Linda Thompson, a retired Baltimore police officer, replied.

We will see.... but what about the rest of Baltimore..... will it be ""all right"" as well?  BTW, only three of Fletcher's attackers have been arrested so far.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/838482142899245/?type=3,2015-05-12 18:40:01,11,2,4,11,0,0,0,0,0

Why We Deserve Better Leadership in America.

The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.
Marcus Aurelius

For the last few days, as I navigated a very busy schedule, I did not write but I did THINK and think deeply about the fiasco that we have found ourselves in.  So, you ask, what fiasco?  The first is the inability to think rationally as adults.  Everything in political life now rests upon two questions:  ""Do you like me? "" and if the answer is ""yes"".... then the next question is:
 
""Why, is it because I am cute/funny/pretty/handsome?""  followed by ""What can you do FOR me now?""  

If the answer to the aforementioned question happens to be ""no"", then the next question willy by ""Why, is it because:

I am fat/skinny/Black/White/Asian/Latin/woman/man/ugly/too pretty for you/gay/straight/lesbian/transgender/tall or short?  And this is followed by ""What can I DO TO you now?""

Because in an entitlement society, everyone ""deserves"" to be liked and you must be punished for NOT liking a person because,after all, everyone DESERVES LOVE AND AFFECTION.  And if you don't love me, you are racist, ______ ophobic (fill in the blank), and deserving of your and 2000 or more of your ""closest allies"" at-will"" persecution, silencing and even death.  AND because this is your right, (to be liked), you are able to carry out any and all offenses with the silent nod of the political class, who will wholeheartedly play upon the soft under-belly of resentment from not being liked by telling you that as you loot, shoot and burn down neighborhoods...... ""your time has come"".  You will vote for these types and give them high approvals because, for the most part, the IQ slips 50 points down in a ""group""..... it does not climb ... in other words two heads may be greater than one but by the third head the trio becomes one big dunce.  As you add more to the group, the problem gets exponentially worse, especially with bad or nonexistent leadership.  

So, now in ""group think"" emotionally charged environment we see the the everlasting ""polls""....  and these polls show you what the ""majority"" of ______ are thinking.  This is so that you.... John/Jane Doe Citizen can ""fall in line"" with the ""majority"", no matter how idiotic or nonsensical the thinking and actions of the ""majority"" can and will be.  Let me give you some examples: 

.  African-Americans and Latinos believe the police do target minorities (69 percent and 54 percent, respectively). Fewer than a third of whites feel that way (29 percent).  What does this mean?  Does it mean that ""cops hate minorities""? Ummmm... no.  It means that it is unusual that your average person can see things from anything outside of their own experiences.  Of course, no one has it worse than YOU because YOU can only feel your own experiences.... not the other guy's.  Also, if your experiences are fraught with negative incidents, then YOU feel the brunt of the attention, not the positive aspects.  Last night two policemen in Hattiesburg, Mississippi stopped a Hyundai vehicle carrying three suspects, shots were fired by ""one individual"" from the vehicle.  The result is that on this Mother's Day..... two mothers will be in gut wrenching anguish as they mourn the loss of their LAW ABIDING sons they gave birth to just a little over two short decades ago.  One of the arresting officers is just two years older than my ""big baby"".  I am sure that if you spoke with THESE mothers, you would be able to glean from them a moment by moment account of the first moments of their now deceased baby boy's first moments on this earth.  these are the first Hattiesburg officers to die in the line of duty in 30 years.

Hattiesburg resident Tamika Mills was quoted by The Clarion-Ledger as saying some bystanders came upon the officers on the ground, and that one of the officers asked ""… 'Am I dying? I know I'm dying. Just hand me my walkie-talkie,'""

A true hero.....  doing his job.  

.  Last week, a very inexperienced prosecutor, charged 6 policemen/women with a number of charges, after which she exhorted the crowd with, among other things ""As young people, our time is now,"" to a screaming, fawning crowd moments before she giddily told HER mommie that the major news outlets were watching and her proud mommie replied that  ""The world's her stage right now, and she's shining like a star.""  I am happy for Mosby's mother, her daughter's ""rise to the stars"" will come at the expense of the destruction of 6 lives because of raw, naked ambition.  But that's besides the point.  And what of the ""mom and pop"" businesses, wig shops, hair-dressing salons, drug-stores, auto-body shops, and the other various and sundry businesses now burned to the ground as the looters and shooters who had not a pot to pee in nor the window to throw it out of made them all one in the same?  Well, just another milky way step on the road to fame for the leadership of Baltimore who will play the ""you hate me 'cause I'm black card"" as they too hitch their rusty chain to the ""star"" of race and victim politics.

We deserve better in America, not just for ourselves but for future generations.  As we mothers and fathers raise our progeny, we should allow them to ""walk a mile"" in the other man's or woman's shoes.  People don't emerge from the birth canal wearing a policeman's uniform.  it is a profession and in this profession you will have good and bad people.  It is incumbent upon the stronger minds and intellects to make sure that we project the correct messages, understanding that if you target one group, eventually, the majority - with their combined mob insanity will eventually turn on YOU.  

We deserve better in America than voting ""identity"" politics, we don't ""hate women"" because we can't vote for Hillary Clinton.  We just hate the drama, we just hate the deceit, we just think that these last few years have done more to tear us apart than bring us together.  We just don't believe that she is a good leader.

Finally, we deserve better in America than demagogues who seek anarchy by destroying the very men and women who hold back the tide of madness, larceny and destruction.  We know that our personal tendency is towards cowardice and it is those brave one percent among us that keep us from the shackles of bondage to other humans who hold within themselves very dark hearts.  The average police person, military, fireman and other public servant will embody the spine and backbone that too many of us lack and shame on those who say differently.

1. It was founded for mourning women to remember fallen soldiers and work for peace. And when the holiday went commercial, its greatest champion, Anna Jarvis, gave everything to fight it, dying penniless and broken in a sanitarium.

2.   It all started in the 1850s, when West Virginia women's organizer Ann Reeves Jarvis—Anna's mother—held Mother's Day work clubs to improve sanitary conditions and try to lower infant mortality by fighting disease and curbing milk contamination, according to historian Katharine Antolini of West Virginia Wesleyan College. The groups also tended wounded soldiers from both sides during the U.S. Civil War from 1861 to 1865.

3.  Anna Jarvis never had children of her own, but the 1905 death of her own mother inspired her to organize the first Mother's Day observances in 1908.

4.  Largely through Jarvis's efforts, Mother's Day came to be observed in a growing number of cities and states until U.S. President Woodrow Wilson officially set aside the second Sunday in May in 1914 for the holiday. ""It wasn't to celebrate all mothers. It was to celebrate the best mother you've ever known—your mother—as a son or a daughter."" That's why Jarvis stressed the singular ""Mother's Day,"" rather than the plural ""Mothers' Day,""

5.  The holiday Anna Jarvis launched has spread around much of the world, though it's celebrated with varying enthusiasm, in various ways, and on various days—though more often than not on the second Sunday in May.

In much of the Arab world, Mother's Day is on March 21, which happens to loosely coincide with the start of spring. In Panama the day is celebrated on December 8, when the Catholic Church honors perhaps the most famous of mothers, the Virgin Mary. In Thailand mothers are honored on August 12, the birthday of Queen Sirikit, who has reigned since 1956 and is considered by many to be a mother to all Thais.

Britain's centuries-old Mothering Sunday, the fourth Sunday of the Christian period of Lent, began as a spring Sunday designated for people to visit their area's main cathedral, or mother church, rather than their local parish.

Mothering Sunday church travel led to family reunions, which in turn led to Britain's version of Mother's Day.

The plainclothes New York police officer who was shot in the face as he approached an armed man on a Queens street died from his injuries on Monday, the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, said.

The officer, Brian Moore, 25, had been in critical condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center since Saturday evening when fellow officers rushed him to the emergency room from the residential street where the shooting occurred.

""I did not know this officer in person in life; I've only come to know him in death,"" Mr. Bratton said to reporters outside the hospital.

Mr. Bratton called Officer Moore ""an extraordinary young man"" and said his death was ""a great loss to this profession and to this city.""

Before the ambulance carrying Office Moore's body left the hospital, distraught relatives placed their hands on it with hundreds of officers looking on.

Demetrius Blackwell, 35, was arraigned in Queens County Criminal Court on Sunday in the shooting of an officer.

428053320608798_835075049906621,"Good Sunday Morning!

Men, Mondawmin and the Mob.

A friend of mine sent me an article this morning entitled ""'Lord of the Flies' comes to Baltimore"" , it was written by John Blake.  John Blake is a journalist who writes about race and culture as well as other topics for CNN.  He spoke about how ""his neighborhood"" has disappeared because all of the ""older Black men"" have largely disappeared, either because they have ""died off"" or they have long prison sentences.  He got this from a man by the name of Zachary Lewis who he found standing by a makeshift memorial placed at the spot where Freddie Gray, the man whose death ignited the riots, was arrested.

Older Black men, hmmmmm.....  so how old is this Zachery Lewis?  I mean, since he is is standing out on the street, so disillusioned by the lack of role models, he must be about 12 or 13...... right?  Nope.....  Mr. Zachery Lewis is 28.  

What we are talking about is a man old enough to be out of law school for three years or medical school for 2.  By the time that my father was 28 he was a sergeant in the army with 5 kids.  He had just bought a brand new home in Willingboro New Jersey and allowed us kids to pick out the living room furniture (he gave  us three choices) and we had to stay ""dressed up"" all day. He considered himself, at that time one of the ""older men.""  At 28 years old, my husband was a captain in the military.  He was responsible for his entire battery of 100 or so men.  We got married and assumed the mortgage of a very sweet little house close to the campus of the university where I achieved my Ph.D.  He considered himself, at that time one of the ""older men"".

But the man I want to speak about today is my Uncle Eddie who lived there in Baltimore, RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM MONDAWMIN MALL.  He lived on Reisterstown Road until his death in the middle 1990's.  He was married from the time that he arrived from Jamaica in the middle 40's until the day of his death.  he was a white man, my grandmother's brother, and Aunt Bessie was Black - and a very fine looking woman.  They settled into life right there in that neighborhood, with him working ""up-town"" and working his way up the ladder at a business far outside of the neighborhood.  Aunt Bessie pretty much managed the household, buying up most of the properties around the neighborhood and managing the rentals, raising their two children and running a women's neighborhood club in the basement.  The tenants of the once nice homes were a mixed lot, some interracial couples and their children, homosexual couples (who kept their places really nice) and some people down on their luck from divorces and the like.  A real mixed story of challenges but all decent people.This was never a neighborhood with ""white picket fences"".  My aunt played ""the numbers"" and cooked every night for my uncle who could have eaten where he worked, given the nature of his employment, but refused to.  

He was friends with George, a former Tuskegee airman, who owned a massive number of liquor stores, and was fairly rich.  ""Donnie"", their friend was very high in the waste management administration of Baltimore, was also in their circle and they would complain about how much he ate but my aunt still fried more pork chops or more chicken and made more potato salad to accommodate him on every other Saturday when he was off.  Several other men would come and go from the circle from time to time but these were the core three.  The played cards, dominoes, ate, drank good liquor (supplied by George) and talked politics.  Their sons would sit and listen quietly and later when they were in college, they would join in.  When I visited, I was in the kitchen or living room with the other wives and daughters/nieces.... we females did not interrupt......  It just wasn't done.  We could hear them through the window of the covered front porch and when they got a bit rowdy, my aunt would just shake her head and smile.  It was a different era..... Even when my uncle and his friends bought a huge fishing boat and would make an every-so-often expedition, the women of their lives proclaimed that they did not want to go and would say that the water would ""mess up their hair"".  The reality was that for those two days, they could do whatever they wanted without having to rush home, cook clean and entertain.

So what happened?  Sure these three men are now dead and gone.  That is the one surety in life.  The binding mindset among these men was that from the front porch on Reisterstown Road, they saw the change of the neighborhood.  Crack cocaine, the breakdown of the family,the corrupt politicians and they sent their sons far, far away.  The decent, but down on their luck tenants were replaced by street-walkers, drug addicts with many babies waiting on a welfare check from which you might or might not be able to collect the rent from depending on the time you could catch them. The rental apartments became dirty, the language filthy and the kids were unsupervised. And the tenants looking for an angle to sue - easy money.  They also sent their daughters far, far, away.  My uncle's sons moved to Hawaii and Europe.... where they met women who were native to those areas.  George's son married a Japanese woman and lives in Malaysia.  ""Donnie's"" daughter lives in upstate New York, her daughter will attend an Ivy league university in the fall.  These men were successful and now they are gone, but not before.......  George sold his stores because the managers set him up for a robbery.  He survived one bullet wound but was able to barricade himself in a ""safe room"" he had made in the back of one of the stores, he sold the boat, his home and moved to Florida.  Uncle was threatened with a gun from a tenant's son who had been living on the property for two years without paying.  Aunt Bessie was with him at the time and yelled at the boy ""  Put that thing down before I hurt you"" ---- the boy must have been surprised or maybe it was the she looked like she could be his ""grandmama"" but he did and he said he was sorry.  Nevertheless, uncle sold every unit except his own and allowed no-one much after Aunt Bessie died.  ""Donnie"" workers found the body of a child on their inspection rounds and he retired.

That is what happens, interpersonally, when people DECIDE to let their lives go.  When people become the pawns of politicians and budding politicians who see these poor ignorant residents and the vehicles that will allow their ""time to come""... that is when you see the likes of Detroit, and other urban blights.  

When men like Zachary Lewis, at the age of 28, is still waiting for an ""older man"" to be his guide, we have a monumental problem. There was a time when Black men wanted to be considered ""MEN"" and now they seem, at least in this case to be content with being ""boys.""   You see, unwittingly, the author compared this situation to the ""Lord of the Flies"" without acknowledging that the oldest boy depicted in the book was under the age of 14. The author cites another man in his article also in his late 20's who said now he would stop ""rippin and runnin"".......  one problem..... what is he going to do?  He is not young, he is not an adolescent, and guess what?  After $15,000 per pupil was spent on his behalf, he probably did not graduate what is he going to do now?

This is a problem of monumental proportions and one that can not be solved by convicting 6 policemen in the court of public opinion in order to bolster the ambitions of a prosecutor and her husband.  There is no ""DA man"" holding Black Baltimore down, rather, it is Black Baltimore.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/835075049906621/?type=3,2015-05-03 08:49:19,61,13,39,61,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_834447893302670,"Born today:

Eldridge Cleaver, Black Panther Who Became G.O.P. Conservative

Leroy Eldridge Cleaver was born in Wabbaseka, Ark., south of Little Rock, in 1935, to Leroy Cleaver, a waiter and piano player in a local nightclub, and Thelma Cleaver, an elementary school teacher. When the father became a waiter on the Super Chief train, the family moved to Phoenix, a stop on the train's run from Chicago to Los Angeles. Mr. Cleaver later said that his father often beat his mother and that soon after the family moved to the Watts section of Los Angeles, his parents separated.

Mr. Cleaver had barely started Abraham Lincoln Junior High School -- where his mother was a janitor -- when he was arrested for bicycle theft and sent to reform school, where the older boys inspired loftier ambitions. Almost immediately after his release, he was sent to another reform school, for selling marijuana. A few days after he was released from that school, he was arrested for marijuana possession, and made the big time: two and one half years at Soledad state prison.

He began reading widely and received his high school diploma at Soledad, forming, he wrote in ''Soul on Ice,'' ''a concept of what it meant to be black in white America.'' But a year later Mr. Cleaver was arrested for his rapes, convicted of assault with intent to murder and sent first to San Quentin prison and then Folsom for a term of 2 to 14 years.

He became first a jailhouse Black Muslim convert, then after the split in the Nation of Islam followed Malcolm X. In mid-1965, eight years into his term, he wrote to Beverly Axelrod, a well-known white civil liberties lawyer in San Francisco asking for help in pleading for parole.

Ms. Axelrod took his essays to Edward M. Keating, Rampart's owner and editor. When Mr. Cleaver went before the parole board, he was a published writer with the support of literary lights like Mr. Geismar, Norman Mailer and Paul Jacobs.

Freed in December 1966, with a job reporting for Ramparts in San Francisco, Mr. Cleaver helped organize Black House, a cultural center, where he met Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, the co-founders of the Black Panther Party, which they called an organization for ''self-defense'' against the police.

Freed from Prison With a Radical Goal

The Panthers were a growing presence in Oakland, shadowing police patrols, whom they accused of brutalizing the black community, and openly displaying weapons. Mr. Cleaver quickly joined the party as minister of information -- chief spokesman and propagandist.

''We shall have our manhood,'' Mr. Cleaver declared. ''We shall have it or the earth will be leveled by our attempts to gain it.''

Mr. Cleaver also began teaching an experimental course at the University of California at Berkeley in fall 1968, which infuriated then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, who declared, ''If Eldridge Cleaver is allowed to teach our children, they may come home one night and slit our throats.''

At the time, Mr. Cleaver regularly referred to Mr. Reagan as Mickey Mouse in his speeches. It is a measure of Mr. Cleaver's many changes that in 1982 he was booed and hissed by the Yale Afro-American student society for supporting Mr. Reagan.

As tensions between the Panthers and the authorities rose, Mr. Cleaver was caught up in a shootout in April 1968 in which a 17-year-old Panther, Bobby Hutton, was killed and Mr. Cleaver and two policemen were wounded. Facing the revocation of his parole and new charges, Mr. Cleaver jumped a $50,000 bail late that year and fled into exile, first to Cuba and then to a home in Algeria, then a leftist haven.

Mr. Cleaver married Kathleen Neal in 1967, the daughter of Foreign Service officer. She followed him to Algeria, and they had two children, a son, Maceo, now 29, and a daughter, Joju, 28. The couple divorced in 1987, and Mrs. Cleaver is now a lawyer and teacher.

At first Mr. Cleaver toured Communist countries triumphantly, hailing Kim Il Sung of North Korea, among others. But disillusion set in, and there was increasing friction between the Algerian Government and Mr. Cleaver's entourage. There was an internal struggle between Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Newton, too, and Mr. Cleaver broke with the Panthers in 1971.

Spiritual Awakening And Surrender to F.B.I.

''I had heard so much rhetoric about their glorious leaders and their incredible revolutionary spirit that even to this very angry and disgruntled American, it was absurd and unreal,'' Mr. Cleaver wrote later,

The family moved to France. There, Mr. Cleaver said, contemplating suicide one night with a gun in his hand, he suddenly had a vision in which his old Marxist heroes disappeared in smoke and a blinding light led him to Christianity. In 1977, he returned to the United States and surrendered to the F.B.I. under a deal with the Government by which he pleaded guilty to the assault charge stemming from the shootout. Charges of attempted murder were dropped, and he was sentenced to 1,200 hours of community service.

But, Mrs. Cleaver said in a 1994 interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, ''he came back a very unhealthy person, unhealthy mentally, and I don't think he's ever quite recovered. He became a profoundly disappointed and ultimately disoriented person.''

Mr. Cleaver drifted in his enthusiasms. He opened a boutique for the trousers he created featuring what he called the Cleaver sleeve. He embraced various religions. He ran a recycling business for a while, but other recyclers accused him of stealing their garbage. He was treated for addiction to crack cocaine in 1990. A crack charge two years later was dropped because of an illegal search, but in 1994 Berkeley police found him staggering about with a severe, never fully explained, head injury and a rock of crack in his pocket. He proclaimed himself a conservative and ran, unsuccessfully, for various local offices as a Republican.

His political turnabout was such that, in the 1980's, he demanded that the Berkeley City Council begin its meetings with the Pledge of Allegiance, a practice they had abandoned years before.

''Shut up, Eldridge,'' Mayor Gus Newport told the man who had once been the fiercest emblem of 1960's radicalism. ''Shut up or we'll have you removed.''

428053320608798_834444959969630,"Good Friday Evening!

A Hurried Judgement.

Maryland state prosecutor Marilyn Mosby charged six officers in relation to the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, whose suffered severe spinal injuries when he was arrested on April 12 and died a week later.

The charges range from second-degree murder and manslaughter at the most serious end of the scale to a simple misconduct charge at the other. Five of the six have been detained.

She was excited, breathless even, as she read the charges and then proclaimed that she would get justice for the angry masses who burned down her city over the previous evenings.  She is one of them, and she is launching her career..... maybe a congressional member...... maybe a senator......... the anticipation made her giddy.

But...... How in the world does a prosecutor less than 24 hours after receiving the police report, and only a mere few hours after receiving the ME report, file such a laundry list of charges? 

She said she worked ""night and day""!!!

And she texted her Mom:  

""Heads up,"" she wrote. ""National media is focusing on me."" Giddy again.

""You'll be all right,"" Linda Thompson said she replied.

""I know,"" Marilyn Mosby responded.  Afterall... she has been on the job for less than four months.... but now Mosby has suddenly became a star on television and social media....

""She always wanted to be an attorney and work for the community,"" said Thompson, her mother. ""The world's her stage right now, and she's shining like a star.""

Awwww.....

Guess what else?  Mosby's husband, Nick, a member of the Baltimore City Council who represents the West Baltimore neighborhood where Gray was arrested. His political future, the letter said, ""will be directly impacted, for better or worse, by the outcome of your investigation.""

Guess what else?  Mosby's is friends with William H. ""Billy"" Murphy Jr., the attorney representing Gray's family. On Friday night, Murphy said her decision to file charges ""has given the family hope.""

Murphy raised money for Mosby's campaign and was a member of her transition team, according to Ivan Bates, a former prosecutor and longtime Baltimore defense attorney. Maryland campaign finance records show Murphy contributed $5,000 to her campaign.

Aside from her family background in law enforcement, Ms. Mosby has other personal ties to justice issues. When she was growing up in Boston, a 17-year-old cousin was mistaken for a drug dealer and killed outside her home by another 17-year-old.

Ms. Mosby has been outspoken about the need to hold police officers accountable.

Hence she has promised the rioters that is is their time to rise.

Well, that sounds like the policemen will get a bit of that fairness she promised the rioters.  

So now she says to the approval of the crowd:  ""To the people of Baltimore and the demonstrators across America, I heard your call for 'no justice, no peace,' "" Ms. Mosby said. ""Your peace is sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young man. To those that are angry or hurt or have their own experience of injustice, I urge you to channel your energy peacefully.""

Instead of ""delivering"" justice, how about ""pursuing"" justice with a ""blind eye"" towards advocating or taking up sides?

Well........ what about the ""homicide"" and ""assault"" charges?

""The only explanation is that they were in the works and crafted before all the available information was in front of her. This rush to the courthouse did not end well for the Martin family, didn't bode well for Michael Brown's family, and isn't looking much better for Gray's family. Juries aren't big fans of cases where it's painfully obvious that the prosecutor has simply hurled a barrage of charges upon a defendant with the hope that one or some stick. They are more likely to acquit on all counts.""

In addition, there is a visceral need by this very inexperienced and very ambitious prosecutor to frame this in terms of race......   Three officers are black, three are white. White, Goodson and Porter are black. It seems odd (?) that this is framed as a racial thing, since half of the cops involved are black and the cop accused of the worst offense is black. Interesting that no one in the media has yet shown pictures of the police officers?

The entire community is black leadership: mayor, city council, congressman, etc.. So, all of a sudden, Baltimore is disenfranchised due to white police?  Education spending amounts to $15,000.00 per pupil ... this is the outcome. Nod and a wink leadership.. the white man is out to get us.. even though we are leading our own city ... when to we take responsibility?

But I digress.....

This is the biggest over-reach I've ever seen by a prosecutor. And a complete lack of judgement.

What will happen when this goes to the grand jury and the outcome is not what the mob wants?  What else will burn?",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/834444959969630/?type=3,2015-05-01 20:19:18,94,32,90,94,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_833583343389125,"Good Wednesday Evening!

How do you react when something is wrong?

Carson's comments to GQ have attracted some scorn, derision and sarcasm from various publications....for comparing protests against police to protests against plumbers.  But... what he said was simply this:

""We need to get to the bottom of any problems of discrimination. But the larger issue here is, how do you react when something is wrong? If you have an unpleasant experience with a plumber, do you go out and declare a war on all plumbers? Or teachers or doctors? Of course not. And it makes no sense to do that with police either.""

Wow, that is pretty profound..... no he is not comparing the protests against police to the protest against plumbers.  No, instead what he is giving you is a good, old fashioned lesson in how to behave.  And how to react.  

We have raised our children for the past 4 decades with the ""Brady Bunch"" mentality..... you know, we will all be kind, things should always be fair, people will always accept you and no-one should judge YOU but YOU have the right and obligation, of course, to judge others.  There are 5 main understandings that will influence the way you react:

1.  Life is not fair, and will never be.  ""Fair"" is subjective.  What you might feel is fair, another might not.  For example, everyone feels that they should be paid their ""fair share"" and most would describe THEIR ""fair share"" as something more than what they get right now.  After all, we work hard......  so much harder than the guy or gal over there.  So what if he/she has more education, more talent, puts in longer hours, take a greater risk and just tries harder.  We can only feel OUR pain, and thus we can only see OUR point of view.

2.  All people will not like you.  All people will not like your lifestyle.  Tolerance is all most of us will ever gain.  Have you ever been to someone's home for an extended period of time and felt relieved when you finally get home?  In the time that you stayed in that person's home.... it might even be a greatly beloved person, you tolerated idiosyncratic behavior because you knew that it would come to an end.... soon.  In addition, all people will not like YOU and you will not like some people.  For whatever quirky reason, we develop an affinity or not for people within the first few minutes of meeting them, other times, we grow to dislike a person over time.  Whatever the reason, shake it off, its just life.

3.  Discrimination is.  It just is.  When we date only tall people, aren't we discriminating against shorties?  On a serious note, though, most discrimination in the workforce IS illegal and can be met with stiff fines and such, however, it occurs. Studies have shown that people who are very overweight make on an average much less than people who are thin, for example.  Do you give up?  NO.  Discrimination arises from the need of people with small minds  to categorize and therefore set limits because it makes THEM comfortable.  The real challenge here is discovering if this discrimination comes from something that is a benign characteristic which is clearly illegal or something within.  The problem gets worse when we only look at the discrimination and not objectively at WHAT we have to offer.  For example, I often hear people asking for politicians to provide them with ""jobs"".  You can not GET a job until you have something to offer in return for that job.  Do you have relevant skills, are you reliable, do you have the education?  Any career or job is in and of itself discriminatory when it requires skills and without those skills you are unable to obtain that job.

4.  Values and characteristics vary from one person to another; one ""set of people"" to another but sometimes DO lead to ""stereotyping"".  All white people are not rich and selfish; all Hispanics are not willing to do the work that American's don't want, Catholic and predisposed to producing multitudes of children; all Asians don't have IQ's in the ""genius"" range and pronounce ""very"" as ""velly""; all Black people don't dance well, become ""baby-mamma's and baby daddy's"", do poorly on scholastic tests, get violent easily and answer their phones with the greeting ""Who Dat"".  In addition, gay men don't have to be feminine, lesbians don't have to be manly.   

The most bizarre characterizations would be the stereotyping of people by profession.  America seems to have declared war upon the only profession that stands between us and the raw anarchy of the ""mob"" mindset..... the police.  Certainly, there are bad apples, in every walk of life this is true but not as a rule.  In addition, members of the military don't come back geared for war as the newsperson from CNN declared. These military are people who had the bravery to put their own lives on the line for others. All that newscaster risked was bad breath for talking so much.

But these exaggerated characterizations do influence people's perceptions for the better or the worse. Your reaction to these characterizations or stereotypes will often be exacerbated by the media which feeds upon these images and story-lines to attract those who seek affirmation for their feelings.  Images of wild young Black men destroying their own neighborhoods feed the feelings of those who stereotype Black men as violent and irrational.  How does looting, trashing and destroying your own neighborhood represent the desire to obtain education and get jobs?  How would throwing bottles at the heads of police officers and setting their cars of fire persuade them to treat you with respect?

5.  People are motivated by different things.  You can not change the mind of an extremist by giving him a good job or making it possible for him to own a corner grocery store.  Some people want to hang out and get high all day, just like some people want to climb the highest mountain.  A great deal of the rabble rousers at the riots across the country are pros at that.  They need the feel of inciting a crowd like a baby needs milk.  They don't care about the reason, they have no cause that they care about.  It is similar to the ""hippie"" people from the 60's who loved a good protest march like a fat kid loves cake.  These people travel from Ferguson to Baltimore and any stop in between.  They are feeding what is needing in THEM and not in you.

What do you think?

A mystery woman seen berating and hitting a black-clad teenager, who reportedly is her son, has been hailed as ""mom of the year"" after her intervention on the Baltimore streets was caught on video. As violence flared up across the city Monday, the woman, who hasn't been identified, was captured telling the teenager, who also hasn't been identified, to ""take that f—— mask off.""

The Riot, it makes ""No Sense"".

Freddie Gray Jr., died Sunday before last from a severe spinal cord and other injuries sustained in police custody.

The protests started quietly at first... and then the riots broke out.

""My family wants to say, can you all please, please stop the violence? ... Freddie Gray would not have wanted this,"" Gray's sister said.

""It is so frustrating that people think that this makes sense, to destroy our community,"" the mayor said.

The riot happened after the funeral for Freddie Gray, who died after being injured in police custody.  Instead of mourning some people saw an opportunity...looting stores at a mall, people were carrying clothes and other items away; cars have been burned, other stores have been looted; a pharmacy caught fire during the mayhem; officers were attacked with bricks and other things hurled at them, their patrol cars vandalized, they were wounded; some officers suffered broken bones.

Gray family attorney Billy Murphy said the family is urging for calm.  ""They don't want this movement nationally to be marred by violence,"" he said. ""It makes no sense.""

As people arrived home from work, some yelled at the youths to stop causing trouble.  They need to live in the neighborhood being torn asunder. Some of the youth were still wearing their khaki pants, which are a part of many Baltimore public school uniforms.

In a statement Monday, the department called it a ""credible threat"" and said members of the Black Guerilla Family, the Bloods and the Crips have formed a partnership against the police.  They want to ""take out"" a police officer ... or two .... or more.

Only the Black Guerilla's are not so much mourning Mr. Gray as they are just wanting to kill somebody, especially if that somebody is a policeman.  Earlier this year, Baltimore police said the Black Guerilla Family sent a man into the Northeastern District station house with marijuana, cocaine and a loaded gun to test the station's security.

So... who was Freddie Gray Jr.?  As children, he and his two sisters were found to have damaging lead levels in their blood, which led to multiple educational, behavioral and medical problems, according to a lawsuit they filed in 2008 against the owner of a Sandtown-Winchester home they rented for four years.

The family was poor and the mother involved with drugs.She began ""sniffing"" heroin when she was 23.  All three of the children — Carolina, now 27, and twins Freddie and Fredericka — were born ""preemie,"" Gloria Darden said in a deposition.

""They were real small and they had to keep them inside the hospital for a couple months, like until they gained five pounds,"" Darden said of the twins. ""I had them too early, had to have them like when I was seven months pregnant."" The lawsuit focuses on 1459 N. Carey St., where he lived from ages 2 to 6. The ""beat up"" house, as Darden described it, had ""peeling and peeling"" paint in every room. The rent was $300 a month.He had been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. His sisters spoke of having to repeat grades and other problems.

 It is not known if the Gray siblings received a monetary award, but a friend said the house on Lorraine Avenue was bought with lead paint money.  State property records show Carolina Gray and Fredericka Gray purchased the home in 2011 for $112,000.

On April 12, 2015, 25 year-old Freddie Gray was taken into custody by the Baltimore Police Department for possession of a switchblade.The police report noted that Gray's arrest at the Gilmor Homes public housing complex took place ""without force or incident.""  Within an hour of his arrest, Gray had fallen into a coma and been taken to a trauma center, where it was determined that he had suffered from a spinal injury. According to his family, Gray's spine was ""80% severed"" at his neck, he had three fractured vertebrae, and his larynx was injured.  Despite extensive surgery in an attempt to save his life, Gray died on April 19, 2015.

 Police Commissioner Anthony Batts reported that the officers ""failed to get [Gray] medical attention in a timely manner multiple times"", and did not buckle him in the van while he was being transported to the police station.

On April 25, 2015 turned violent, resulting in 34 arrests and the injuries of 15 police officers. Following Gray's funeral on April 27, the unrest intensified, culminating with the declaration of a state of emergency in Baltimore City.

Six police officers have been suspended with pay, as the city conducts a preliminary investigation, family members and local civil rights leaders have called for an outside investigation by  the U.S. Justice Department or the FBI to get at the truth.

It makes no sense.  None at all.... from the beginning to the end.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/832682883479171/?type=3,2015-04-27 21:26:49,23,6,12,23,0,0,0,0,0
428053320608798_831735663573893,"Good Sunday Morning!

The Assault on Christianity:  If We Stand For Nothing.... We Get Nothing

This morning I will head to church, I can not say that I go EVERY week and I can't say that I attend Mass every day, however, one of the things I expect to hear from my pastor or my priest is a reading from the Bible... which is the basis of any Christian Church - be it Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist or Pentecostal or.....

We have heard in the news most recently about the assault on Christianity from afar.  You know, Middle Eastern countries, ISIS or ISIL.  We get incensed and rightfully so but we feel comfort in the idea that miles and oceans separate us from ""those people"".  Occasionally we will also hear about ""those atheists"" who want to make sure you know that they are there by pressing for the elimination or religiosity from the public discourse completely. Atheists would find solace, themselves, if anyone tried to proselytize to them but in the absence of that level of persuasion they feel that they must go after the Christian first through organizations and then through though and culture.  But since many people don't entertain friends who don't believe as they do, the possibility of a Christian having a spirited personal discourse with an atheist is almost .... nonexistent.

But what about when the threat to Spiritual belief comes from within from people who have, through talent, luck, and hard work felt that they have climbed the ladder of success so high as to challenge the Word of God Himself.  These people have become so wealthy and so prominent that the fact that they employ people and some look up to them that they become a form of ""demi-gods"" so much so that they can interpret the Word to fit the times or their own proclivities.  For example:

>In an unprecedented move, more than 100 prominent Roman Catholic donors and church members signed a full-page ad running Thursday in The Chronicle that calls on Pope Francis to replace San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone for fostering ""an atmosphere of division and intolerance.""  And why so?

""The plea follows months of dissent within the archdiocese over Cordileone's emphasis on traditional, conservative church doctrine — including asking high school teachers and staffers at Catholic schools to sign a morality clause that characterizes sex outside of marriage and homosexual relations as ""gravely evil.""""

The list of signatories includes Brian Cahill, the retired executive director of Catholic Charities, former city commissioner and Boudin Bakery executive Lou Giraudo, retired Swinerton Builders Chairman David Grubb, businessman and former political consultant Clint Reilly and his wife, Janet, San Francisco attorney Michael Kelly, and Charles Geschke, chairman of Adobe Systems and former head of the University of San Francisco Board of Trustees. Also on the list is Tom Brady Sr., father of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

Impressive.... but what was the ""gist of their beef"" because he is not suggesting anything that is unusual for the Catholic or Christian schools......  You might think that it is unfair but it is not outside of the teachings of the Bible.  So this is the gist....:

1.  He picked a pastor for Star of the Sea parish in the Richmond District ""who marginalizes women's participation in the church by banning girls from altar service"".  Ummmm happens everyday in a number of parishes.

2.  Disregards the advice of his own priests and retired priests in favor of ""a tiny group of advisers recruited from outside (the) diocese and estranged from their own religious orders."" Ummmm I thought he is able to choose his own advisors...

3.   Threatens the long-term health of the archdiocese by adopting a ""single-issue agenda"" against same-sex marriage. 

4.  He also cautions ""administrators, faculty and staff"" to ""arrange and conduct their lives so as not to visibly contradict, undermine or deny"" church teaching.

Well, according to the ""well-known philanthropists in the archdiocese, members of school and university boards, the former director of Catholic Charities CYO, high-profile attorneys and physicians, major figures in the business and corporate world, and officials of trusts, foundations and charitable organizations."" Umm you know, they people with their names on the buildings.... the Archbishop is promoting a way of life nobody practices anymore and might set the crowd of young people running elsewhere --- maybe to the Episcopal Church where it seems anything goes.  Then what would happen to the coffers?

I live in an area where most people can say ""I used to be...."" or ""I did....."" or ""I remember when I was ..."" .  By the very nature of what I do for a living I visit homes that are shrines to achievements from long, long ago.  On Saturday, I went to a Salvation Army store to arrange for a pick-up of stuff I want to get rid of.   This particular location is the drop off point for kids who inherit a lifetime of memorabilia from their wealthy parents but either have no use or no want for these old memories.  Beautiful furniture which cost a fortune in their day, paintings, mementoes, wedding pictures or the most extravagant weddings, debutante invitations .... well you get the picture..... are sitting at the Salvation Army store.  It sort of makes you misty eyed.  

So.... what is my point?  Between those beautiful mementos and some of the people who live close to me who also have buildings at universities named after them and their names in the business history books ......it all passes.  The ""prominent"" San Franciscans who seek to change the words of the Bible and the teachings of the Faith to suit their beliefs are ""prominent"" only for a short time and their efforts on this earth are soon pushed aside.... similar to the wedding pictures, smoking jackets and engraved silver found in the Salvation Army.  

Man has always tried to be god, from the building of the Tower of Babel when he decided to build a tower which was to reach to heaven, to make him equal to God, that too failed and he was scattered to the four corners of the earth.  Man's greatest shortcoming is the merciful short existence he has on the earth.

As for the Archbishop, if it is in Scripture that there is truth in his words and his belief, then he should stand firm.  Proverbs 3: 5- 6

5 Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. 6 Do not add to His words Or He will reprove you, and you will be proved a liar.

Powerhouse of Excellence?

Zeta Beta Tau was founded in 1898 as the nation's first Jewish fraternity, although it is no longer sectarian.  The organization was inspired by Dr. Richard J. H. Gottheil, a professor of languages at Columbia University and a Zionist. On December 29, 1898, he formed a Zionist youth society with a group of students from several New York City universities.  Its motto is ""A Powerhouse of Excellence"".

Contained on the opening page of its website is the following message:

""Welcome to Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT). Founded in 1898 as the world's first Jewish Fraternity, ZBT prides itself on being an inclusive organization welcoming of any college man who understands and appreciates our mission. With more than 140,000 initiated men ZBT's can be found in all aspects of life: business, entertainment, media, politics, and much more. In 1989, ZBT became the first fraternity to abolish pledging from its organization and, in its place, created a brotherhood program that focuses on equal rights, privileges, and responsibilities for all members. Welcome to our Journey. We invite you to explore everything that makes ZBT a ""Powerhouse of Excellence.""""

Z.B.T., which refers to the first letters in the Hebrew phrase ""Zion Bemishpat Tipadeh"", which translated means ""Zion shall be redeemed with judgment"".  Zeta Beta Tau fraternity lists 140,000 members, with chapters and colonies at over 90 campus locations.
Oh, by the way…….  They are open to ""all men of good character""…… except:

While in Panama City Beach April 17, 2015 for a spring formal, the fraternity was accused of abusing disabled military veterans. The Warrior Beach Retreat provides wounded veterans a place to relax and heal. The event was disrupted by a band of fraternity brothers who disrespected and dishonored the veterans. The actions of the University of Florida and Emory University chapters of Zeta Beta Tau, left a dark mark on the recovery retreat. The veterans stayed at Laketown Wharf on Panama City Beach, the same location as the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity spring formal. According to Warrior Beach Retreat Founder, Linda Cope, the students were antagonizing veterans, throwing marshmallows on the vehicles, breaking American flags off of the vehicles and even urinating on the flags. She also started that some of the students made inappropriate comments to the spouses of veterans. One veteran said that he and his service dog were spit on, and beer was poured on them from the 20th floor.  Wikipedia

The University of Florida is investigating allegations its members of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity spat at a group of disabled military veterans last weekend at a resort in Panama City Beach. The fraternity has suspended operations and is cooperating with the investigation.  Emory officials said they are investigating but so far there's no evidence to implicate their students in the incident.
I know, from my stint as a professor, that a level of ""group think"" can be involved with this incident…. With one person trying to out-do the other and the group acting in a manner that they would not behave in … individually.  But this type of behavior has a beginning point and that  point begins with the disrespect for veterans (and others) and the belief that they are ""superior"" to those who volunteer their service and sometimes their lives in sacrifice for OUR freedoms.  At some point these ""frat boys"" were fed a load of garbage that manifested itself in their brains as they were higher and far above these ""dumb saps"" who had no other choice than to become ""cannon fodder"".    I have heard this talk before and even from someone who I previously respected who stated that she ""hates the military"" and downs her own son for serving because ""he has education and can do better"".  She, herself, would have benefitted from the self-discipline and personal ambition  that she would have obtained from the service since she has very little that can be considered ""honorable"" to show for her 56 years on earth.   But I digress.

Linda Cope, the founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat at Laketown Wharf Resort, said that  about 60 veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan were also attending a retreat which has been held twice a year for the last six years at the resort. Cope started the event in honor of her son Joshua, who lost both legs in Baghdad in 2006 when a roadside bomb exploded under his Humvee.
Once, in every generation we disgrace ourselves with this type of disrespect…… I hope that it is not epidemic as it was during the Vietnam era.  But back to the fraternity…….  The original message of ZBT phrase (Zion Bemishpat Tipadeh),  is the passage from Isaiah 1:27 :  God will redeem those who repent. 

In this situation, the message of a loving God is clear:  ""If you will acknowledge your evil sin and turn to God to experience His grace, you will be redeemed, saved forever.""

I am certain that, religious or not, these ""men of good character"" would not like to recount to their children and grandchildren the day they spat in the face of a World War II veteran or urinated on his flag.  At least I don't think they would.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/830828740331252/?type=3,2015-04-24 12:48:29,9,3,15,9,0,0,0,0,0

They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

Treason from Within..... Adam Gadahn 

""A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.""quote from Marcus Tullius Cicero 

And such is the legacy of Adam Gadahn, 36, who was killed along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, in a CIA drone strike targeting a suspected gathering of al-Qaeda operatives in January.

Adam Gadahn was the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country.Gadahn was one of its most prominent members.   Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish.  He went from being an avid lover of heavy metal to a Islamic radical.

Was he any different than most upper middle class kids?  Nope, Gadahn was born in Oregon, United States in 1978, raised a Protestant Christian, and homeschooled through high school by his parents on an isolated farm in Western Riverside County, California.  Gadahn's Jewish paternal grandfather, Carl Pearlman, was a prominent urologist; and on the Board of Directors of the Anti-Defamation League. According to Gadahn, his grandfather was a ""zealous supporter"" of Israel. Gadahn's paternal grandmother, Agnes Branch, a Christian, was an editor for The Christian Family Chronicles.   Philip Gadahn, Adam's father,  was involved in the counterculture movement at the University of California at Irvine, and before Adam's birth became a Christian.  Although his (Adam's father's) Christianity was based solely on his needs rather than the mantra of the word.......  Adam moved out of his parents home by the age of 16 and moved in with his grandparents in the  West Floral Park neighborhood of Santa Ana, California.Wikipedia

He felt that his life was ""empty"" and found Christianity to be ""paranoid"" and hollow.""  Then he found himself ...... In 1995, at age 17, Gadahn began studying Islam at the Islamic Society of Orange County. Members of Gadahn's study group were young fundamentalists.Gadahn moved to Pakistan in 1998, where he married an Afghan refugee and maintained intermittent contact with his family until March 2001, when all contact with his family stopped.  He told his parents that he was a journalist ..... he just did not tell them ABOUT  what and WHO  he worked for....

After Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb.
In the years following 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist.  In his most perfect Arabic, he urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests and urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks.

Famously,  in a 2004 video, he said, ""The streets of America shall run red with blood.""

Gadahn was indicted in 2006 for treason by a federal grand jury, the first American to have been charged since the 1950s.  In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries.

On 23 April 2015, US President Barack Obama announced at a press conference that Gadahn had been killed in a CIA drone strike in Pakistan on 19 January 2015.

Is he different or unique?  What is it that could possibly inveigle ordinary American citizens to attack their own nation and their own way of life?  Just earlier this week, six men from Minnesota who tried to get to Syria to join Islamic State extremists have been arrested and charged with terrorism.  Charged are Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20.  All six were friends in Minnesota and plotted together to join ISIL fighters overseas,

Omar's older brother, Ahmed Ali Omar, was among those who joined al-Shabab, leaving Minnesota in December 2007, according to the complaint. Ahmed Omar remains a fugitive.

So, this and some other conversions --- especially by young women who .... if they are successful making their conversionary trek to ISIL or ISIS will find that they are not much more than breeders as well as second class citizens should make one scratch their head and ask ""WHY?"" Why in the world would you leave the comforts of middle America where the biggest question on your mind could be how Bruce Jenner looks in a maxi dress and size 13 kitten heels?  A place where the likes of Kanye West is a compelling character...... instead of a singer with a few hits and a drunken stage dedication of a woman by the name of Beyonce.

Maybe the answer is in the ramblings of the famous and now dead Adam Gadahn ---- emptiness.  The feeling of profound emptiness.  

The devil makes work for idle hands – and it's striking how much support Jihad finds among idle Westerners.  The kids are alone, they are bored. Dad/Mom have found new adventures, new directions and ""anything goes.""  Don't judge.... unless the object of judgement and derision is Christianity or morality ---- then ""judgement can be ugly, dirty and destructive.   It is amazing how much negative ""push back"" one can get from invoking their belief in the Lord and how much approval can be heaped upon them for any profane act known to man.  The admiration heaped upon a 70 year old man removing his genitalia and having implants connected to his once athletic chest is puzzling but think about how jaded a 16 year old could become if this sad act becomes part of his/her ""ordinary"" terrain.  

In a world where there are no restrictions, no guidance, no rules, emptiness ensues and the need to fill a void will be replaced by something and someone who will impose restrictions, provide strict guidelines and enforce draconian rules.  Young people don't admire the debauchery of old ""cool hipsters"".  In their eyes it is summarized by one word ----- ""gross"".   People (especially young people) love to rebel against the rules, but what happens in a world where there are none - rules ... I  mean?  Just a thought.

Perhaps the ""freedom"" provided to these young people from birth --- you know the freedom from religion, the freedom from respecting elders, the freedom from patriotism, the freedom from ""obligation and respect"" of elders, the freedom from want and the freedom to determine their own truths (even when they are lying) have left a vacuum so vast and empty that they will fill it up with something so much more undesirable for themselves and society.

Perhaps it is time to do better.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/830506487030144/?type=3,2015-04-23 20:37:50,16,3,33,16,0,0,0,0,0

The Fiction or Lie.

According to the Webster's dictionary, fiction consists of written stories about people and events that are not real or  literature that tells stories which are imagined by the writer.  Occasionally, fiction  
and often the best fiction, is based upon real life events.  AND often, fiction is a form of embellishment used to illustrate a point, build a personal story and persuade a population to action.  Often, when caught, the author of personal embellishment will claim a bout of ""mis-remembrance"" ....  Another word for this type of ""embellishment"" in written or verbal form is the simple three letter word known as a ""lie"".

So, why do people lie?  In the absence of a psychological problem, people lie to persuade, to achieve, and to attract. Small personal white lies might save feelings and friendships..... telling your friend that the outfit, no matter how ill-conceived, is attractive .... especially if worn all day by the time you see her/him might save feelings.  Bigger lies occur when society tells ""white lies"" that affect members of a population and instead of being ""harmless"" , end up being quite ""harmful"".

>The ""persuasive"" lie is one in which a person or group decide to ""make things up"" or tell ""half-truths"" in order to ""persuade"" their audience to believe certain larger than life things about themselves.  For example, Hillary Clinton's claim of being ""dead broke"" or racing  across the battleground on foot without any body armor in Iraq after her plane was brought down in a volley of  enemy fire, or the claim that all of her grandparents were immigrants... in fact she even named one in particular  Hanna Jones Rodham as being an immigrant who worked in a lace factory in order to make ends meet.  Or maybe that was the immigrant grandfather who worked in the lace mill to make ends meet.... either way, it seems that grandmother Hanna was really born in Pennsylvania.  Whatever the scenario, whether the politician paints a ""word picture"" by exaggerating experiences in order to identify with the common ""broke folk"", illustrate the bravery of militarily untrained older women on the battlefield, or appear to be a member of the an immigrant class the goal here is to persuade the voter to identify..... true or untrue and move them to the voting booth..  Caution,,,, this strategy only works for politicians..... doing this on a resume or as a news anchor (Brian Williams for example) might be dangerous to your career.

>Another use of ""puffery"" in fiction might be to achieve.  In 2012 Breitbart News  documented the facts surrounding Senator Warren's claims of Native American ancestry and demonstrated that no credible evidence exists to support those claims . But lack of genealogical evidence has never stopped Senator Warren from boldly asserting as fact something which is flatly not true - why would it?.  Despite evidence to the contrary, Warren is determined to be a Cherokee Indian tribal member.  In fact, for the  ""Pow Wow Chow Cookbook"", she produced recipes (along with other Native Americans) of favorite Cherokee Tribe dishes such as ""Cold Omelets with Crab Meat"" and ""Crab with Tomato Mayonnaise Dressing"" these were family traditions until they were found out to be copied from a 1979 New York Times News Service article by Pierre Franey.  Perhaps the real reason for the Native American heritage would be the preferred consideration for a position at an Ivy League University eager to attain their first Native American female professor.  This has been a successful achievement because, despite evidence to the contrary..... the story remains in tact.

>The power of a ""lie"" or work of fiction to ""attract"" is undeniable.  I have always told my girls that the truth is often dull, sometimes strange but hardly ever as elaborate and gilded as a lie.  Being ""dead broke"" means having an often dull or mundane existence centered around simply trying to make the daywork or trying to ""keep your head above water"".  It does not involve international travel, shopping sprees or expensive dinners.  Cherokee indian recipes often contain corn meal, beans, side meat (pork), eggs (often frozen and preserved) and wild onions.  Crab meat omelets with or without mayo are seldom on the menu.  And the possibility of an untrained person dodging enemy fire after being shot from the sky over a Middle Eastern country is highly unlikely unless Captain America used his mighty shield.  

>The attraction component of a lie is very useful but can also be very detrimental to people and causes.  For example, the ""hand's up don't shoot"" fantasy concocted a few short months ago that has brushed off its false mantle and become a flash point for riots, looting and plunder.  Unfortunately this falsity will obscure legitimate complaints and issues. 

Other lies are attractive because they fit a narrative.  We found that to be true with the Rolling Stones piece on a rape that probably never occurred.  What effect this will have on other claims of rape and rape victims will be determined in the future. 

Will any exposed matter?  To some but not to others, especially those who WANT to believe.  Desperately want to believe.   

Final thought:  

""People think that a liar gains a victory over his victim. What I've learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one's reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one's master, condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that person's view requires to be faked…The man who lies to the world, is the world's slave from then on…There are no white lies, there is only the blackest of destruction, and a white lie is the blackest of all.""

428053320608798_827182520695874,"Good Friday Afternoon!

Myths for You to Ponder When Considering a Presidential Candidate

1.  Government spending promotes economic expansion or growth:  The openness to trade and the small(er) size of government are very much associated with poverty reduction and this applies to wealthy as well as poverty stricken economies.  Annual per capita GDP growth is maximized at 3.1 percent at a government expenditure to GDP ratio of 26 percent.  Beyond this level you will find economic growth rates decline.  In other words, government  is useful to a certain point, beyond that ….. regulations and other types of restrictions will restrict growth and development, trapping people in the cycle of poverty.

2. The national debt is a burden that will ruin our children's futures.  

The national debt is often portrayed as something that must be ""paid back"".  As if we are all born with a bill attached to our feet that we have to pay back to the government over the course of our lives.  Of course, that's not true at all.  In fact, the national debt has been expanding since the dawn of the USA and has grown as the needs of US citizens have expanded over time.  There's really no such thing as ""paying back"" the national debt unless you think the government should be entirely eliminated (which I think most of us would agree is a pretty unrealistic view of the world).

The government doesn't necessarily reduce our children's living standards by issuing debt.  In fact, the national debt is also a big chunk of the private sector's savings so these assets are, in a big way, a private sector benefit.  The government's spending policies could reduce future living standards, but we have to be careful about how broadly we paint with this brush.  All government spending isn't necessarily bad just like all private sector spending isn't necessarily good.  And at a macro level debt doesn't get ""paid back"".  In a credit based monetary system debt is likely to expand and contract, but generally expand as the economy expands and balance sheets grow.

3. Immigrants (illegal or legal) take American Jobs:  
Removing the approximately 8 million unauthorized workers in the United States would not automatically create 8 million job openings for unemployed Americans, said Daniel Griswold, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies, in his 2011 testimony before the House Judiciary Sub-committee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement. 
The reason, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is two-fold. For one, removing millions of undocumented workers from the economy would also remove millions of entrepreneurs, consumers and taxpayers. The economy would actually lose jobs. Second, native-born workers and immigrant workers tend to possess different skills that often complement one another.

4. Imports from countries where labor is cheap cause unemployment in the United States.  One of the many problems with this statement  is that it ignores the question: why are wages low in a foreign country and high in the United States? It starts with these wage rates as ultimate givens, and doesn't pursue the question why they are what they are. Basically, they are high in the United States because labor productivity is high–because workers here are aided by large amounts of technologically advanced capital equipment. Wage rates are low in many foreign countries because capital equipment is small and technologically primitive. Unaided by much capital, worker productivity is far lower than in the United States. Wage rates in every country are determined by the productivity of the workers in that country. Hence, high wages in the United States are not a standing threat to American prosperity; they are the result of that prosperity.

5. More, better, and more vigorously enforced regulations can prevent loan and investment losses.

The politicians and their regulatory agencies believe that prior monetary crises were caused by a combination of stupidity, greed, and criminality by bankers and sellers of investments.  The reality is that no army of regulators armed with the most modern analytical tools and the most powerful means of regulatory enforcement can prevent a bad investment  from money supply expansion.  The monetary expansion encourages longer term projects for which the cost of money is a major factor in forecasting success.  But without an increase in real savings, insufficient resources will ensure that many of these projects will never earn a profit and must be liquidated.  Bank and investor losses are inescapable.

6. The US government is running out of money and must pay back the national debt.   The reality is that no government will ever run short of money as long as its spending and debt are denominated in a currency it can create, either directly or indirectly (via a central bank). The lack of any normal financial limit on the extent of government spending and borrowing is a very bad thing.

7. Consumer spending is about 70% of the US economy: This and the previous myth are related, in that the wrong belief that consumer spending is 65%-70% of the total economy lends credence to the wrong belief that economic growth is caused by increasing consumption.

Consumer spending involves taking something out of the economy, so it is mathematically impossible for consumer spending to be more than 50% of the economy. Consumer spending does account for about 70% of US GDP, but that's only because the GDP calculation omits about half the economy (GDP leaves out all intermediate stages of production). Due to the fact that the GDP calculation includes 100% of consumer spending and only about half the total economy, 35% would be a more accurate estimate of US consumer spending as a percentage of the total US economy.

8. 'You're more likely to get bitten by a person than a dog'.  Not true…… bites can range between 4% and 23% of all injuries in the emergency room in a year's time.  They are not the only things people are bitten by, of course – arthropods (mosquitoes and midges, to you and I) are responsible for peaks in hospital admissions over the summer. But nevertheless, dog bites remain consistently high throughout the year. But if you focus on mammals entirely – which includes humans – dogs are clearly the majority of injuries, around 71%.

The treatment figures tell a story too. In short, children are more likely to get bitten on the face, requiring plastic surgery to reconstruct them, older people on the hands or lower body. Having said that, while both human and dog mouths host several hundred species of bacteria, most of the bacteria found in canines' mouths is not harmful to humans, making many dog bites less dangerous than human ones

Why did I include #8?  Because we ask so few questions of our politicians and we should… because evidence indicates that they are really unlikely to ""bite"" you but their policies WILL bite if you don't ask the questions and ponder the information that you should.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/827182520695874/?type=3,2015-04-17 14:32:18,5,0,14,5,0,0,0,0,0

The Courthouse, Black People and the Looo-yah

Yesterday, I spent the morning in the Fort Lauderdale courthouse.  I was testifying in a divorce case.... one of three I am closely aware of.  For those of you who know me, I am fairly tall so I wear a lot of black.  It is easy, it is not too hard to mess up if my dog jumps on me or I spill something or walk into something or someone walks into me.  In other words I like easy clothes.  Anything too complicated will end up Blessing someone shopping at the local Goodwill.  More complicated are my shoes.  As a shoe snob, my favorite ""doggies"" are spiked heels or just very high heels of the more expensive pedigree.  OK, I admit that this is my vice.  Today was zebra printed Louboutin's from two years ago.  They are back in their dust cover for the evening (smile).

But I digress.  

Sooooo..... as I waited to be called.  I fooled around on my cell.  Took a selfie...... and stared at the interesting stories around me.  One married man was in court with his wife because his ""mistress"" wanted support for their love child.  It was amazing how much negotiating the wifey was doing in the hall where I was seated and how sheepish and quiet the husband was.  Well, I guess he had no choice.

And ..... one by one I saw black men and women handcuffed/ and/or handcuffed and leg cuffed.  There is something so shameful about that sight to me that I normally have to look away.  I don't know what these three men and one woman did but they were pretty docile about their plight.  They would have had to inject ME with a sedative if I were in their shoes.  And I wondered....... were there any other ethnicity of people who merited shackles today?

So I began thinking....

Last week, the Black Male Summit hosted 280 high school students traveling from Akron and Canton Ohio and roughly 1,300 more attendees from colleges in 24 states.  Dr. Michael Eric Dyson delivered his standard ""in your face"" speech utilizing  the theme of tackling stereotypes continued in a series of breakout sessions aimed at empowering and uplifting the 1,600 young black men who traveled to UA.

Dyson grew up in Detroit after the 1967 riots.  His style is ""take no prisoners"" .... and I do mean he uses that style on everyone.  

Back to the two day event ....  it involved dozens of speeches and interactive sessions have been designed to engage the audience on racially sensitive and relevant topics — from racially charged words to violence among black men, from minority participation in college to parenting to balancing athletic aspirations and life.

He used rap and hip hop lyrics to express the current need to reach young black men and tackle inequality.we must be given the opportunity to engage in practices that teach us excellence and the patience to become great."" If we are gonna retain young black boys and young black males, we cannot have a double standard where we give everybody else a chance.""  Dyson said.

Two words/phrases stick out to me, no actually ...four......inequality; ""give""; and ""double standard"" and ""hip-hop"".

>Equality/inequality is achieved when ALL people are treated the same.  When you set aside something for one group of people and not another you assume that the group receiving the ""set aside"" needs something ""extra"".

>When you wait for someone to ""give"" something to you, you will always be eating from the ""scraps"" at the table or the seconds.  No one will continue to give the first to anybody.

>A double standard is what is used when people are saying that ""he broke the law and got this punishment"" and ""I broke the law and got that punishment""........  the point here is that you BOTH broke the law.

>Rap and Hip Hop.  Although not all encompassing, it has been known in the past to glorify prison as a way of ""becoming a man"" or ""the man"" but as with all dichotomy, the manhood is often on the line during a long prison stay.Also rife with disrespect for women, and the glorification of sex without love.....  I wonder if this was a good teaching tool to use with youngsters seeking to escape stereotypes.  Further, going back to the shackled people at the courthouse, it could explain their somewhat happy go lucky attitude while chained up.  One guy even had a meaningful discussion with the guard about what type of socks he should wear with HIS shackles.

So back to the courthouse and then I will tie this up.....  I was called......  Went into the courtroom and was respectful to everyone there.  The lawyer leaned over to her client (the wife) and whispered after seeing me .... a black woman, not in a blue suit but well dressed with naturally curly hair --- meaning not straightened and she made a stereotypical judgement.....  she said ""this is going to be easy"" and both she and her client giggled with glee.  One problem.......  I ain't easy.

When I attempted to explain business cycles, the person who identified herself as the ""loo-yah"" asked the judge how ""in the world"" I could be an ""expert"" at business.  I then explained pointedly that as a former tenured professor with an MBA, Ph.D, 17 years in the finance industry and 21 peer refereed articles, I might know a little something about a little something.  The judge agreed.

The person I served as a witness for won the case......  in a big way because the ""loo-yah"" made a value judgement based upon the people of color she normally bumps into in that dimly lit, miserable courthouse of broken lives and dreams.  Do I fault her? 
 
Yes and no.  

Yes because with her prejudiced judgement, biased eye and haughty ways, she will ruin people's lives.  No, because all stereotypes have some basis, however loosely, in the truth. And four things ..inequality; ""give""; and ""double standard"" and ""hip-hop"" when used in the ""grievance business"" will perpetuate the problem.

Time to wake up.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/825806644166795/?type=3,2015-04-15 23:29:48,22,4,12,22,0,0,0,0,0

A jester was an historical entertainer either employed to entertain a ruler or other nobility in medieval or Tudor times or was an itinerant performer who entertained common folk at fairs and markets. Jesters are also modern day entertainers who resemble their Tudor day counterparts. Jesters in medieval times are often thought to have worn brightly coloured clothes and eccentric hats in a motley pattern and their modern counterparts usually mimic this costume. In medieval times jesters entertained with a wide variety of skills: principal ones included songs, music, and storytelling; additional ones included acrobatics, juggling, and magic. Much of the entertainment was performed in a comic style and many jesters made contemporary jokes in word or song about people or events well known to their audiences. 

Modern day jesters perform a wider variety of skills and entertainment which can additionally include stilt walking, fire performance and circus workshops.In modern times, they also have cable comedy shows on HBO with canned applause or make absurd observations at press conferences.

The Hillary Tsunami became a Seiche Wave

I wrongfully thought that the Hillary candidacy announcement would be a tsunami.  

Boy was I wrong!

A tsunami is a powerful wave and can be pretty devastating to any foe, force or land......Seiche waves are due to the movement within a confined space (such as a you-tube announcement instead of an open rally). These have long wavelengths and rarely result in any impact because their  height is generally few inches and their impact fairly mild. 

On Sunday, the expected tsunami became a little wave followed by a little splash.""I'm running for president,"" she said with a smile near the end of a two-minute video released just after 3 p.m.- early evening.

""I want to be that champion,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote — because it's your time. And I hope you'll join me on this journey.""

Then she took off with her crew in a van called ""Scooby"".  ""Scooby"" stopped at Chipotle for a feeding break and the kids serving the tacos and everyone else for that matter neither recognized her nor cared much more than to ask ""Need a little more salsa, M'am?""

By the way, how can you appeal to the ""youngsters"" when you name your van after a cartoon produced from 1969 with its heyday in the 1970's ?  Probably when most of the youngsters PARENTS were born..  You see,the original series, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, was created for Hanna-Barbera Productions by writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears in 1969......... exactly two years before Marco Rubio was born....  and one year before  the birth of Ted Cruz.

So the cool van is a ""grandma-mobile"".

The kids did not recognize their champion and neither did the manager who had to pull the security tape to verify that the champ was present.

The next evening seemed more of a tsunami with Senator Marco Rubio declaring (indirectly) that she was ""yesterday's news""...... in more ways than one.  At 43, the youngest candidate in the rapidly growing 2016 presidential field, Mr. Rubio cast himself as a forward-looking, next-generation leader.

I can't help but think that she must be internally screaming ""Oh NO!!! Not another telegenic ""ethnic"" whippersnapper"" coming to take MY rightful place!

Democrats overwhelmingly support Clinton's candidacy. Much of that enthusiasm is tied to the chance to make history by electing a woman to the presidency.  They want another ""first"".

What does she stand for?  Who knows..... but she is a woman and we are all ready for that.  Right?  But along the way a few stumbles are starting to occur....   First, Mrs. Clinton plans to highlight that she is a grandmother and trumpet her chance to make history.  She wants to show how ""tough"" she is.....  But she also wants to use her gender as a ""weapon"" to deflect any harsh criticism. 

In an appearance today, she stated that she wanted ''We've got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track,'' she said.  Thereby acknowledging that it is pretty much being run into the ground by the current occupants at the White House.  She vowed to get rid of ""yesterday's"" problems even though she herself is being painted as ""yesterday's"" news.  

So, expect the ""grandma"" card; the ""woman"" card; the ""income inequality"" card; and the other cards to come out of this deck.  Anything to win.......  she is now 67 and there will be no other chances.  

All in all...... the press will carry her water, favorably interpret her gaffes and lie if necessary and scream ""womanophobia"" if necessary.....  But in the final stretch, the little seiche wave may need to start building momentum on her own.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/825205747560218/?type=3,2015-04-14 19:09:39,21,2,15,21,0,0,0,0,0
428053320608798_823880097692783,"Died today:  The Great Compromiser.....  Henry Clay

Ran three times for President/Won none.  But had some pretty good accomplishments.

Henry Clay was born into a middle-class family in Hanover County, Virginia, on April 12, 1777, the seventh of nine children. He studied law with the noted George Wythe, mentor of Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall. At age 20, Clay moved to Lexington, Kentucky and quickly established himself as a successful lawyer. His oratorical skills, friendly manner, and inclinations to engage in gambling and drinking made him immensely popular. On April 11, 1799, Henry Clay married Lucretia Hart, youngest daughter of Colonel Thomas Hart, a well-to-do land speculator and merchant. He soon developed considerable personal property and began his association with the conservative landed classes that would continue through his lifetime.

Belonging to the Jeffersonian-Republican party, Clay became interested in politics in Kentucky. He supported emancipation of slaves and voiced opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts. Elected to the Kentucky legislature in 1803, he went to Washington in 1806 to complete an unexpired term in the U.S. Senate. In 1807, he was re-elected to the Kentucky legislature and became its speaker of the house. Re-elected in 1809, he was again sent to take an unexpired U.S. Senate term in 1810. Returning to Kentucky, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, which elected him as its speaker in 1811.

As Speaker of the House, Henry Clay was a prominent War Hawk, pushing for expansion and war with Britain. He also served as a peace commissioner in Ghent in the negotiations ending the War of 1812.

Clay's efforts to forge the Missouri Compromise (1820) were the first of several such ventures dealing with expansion and the spread of slavery. Clay was himself a slave owner, but he favored the emancipation of slaves and their resettlement in Africa.

The Election of 1824 was decided in the House of Representatives. John Quincy Adams won the presidency and selected Henry Clay as his secretary of state — a move that encouraged critics to claim a ""corrupt bargain."" Clay gained widespread support in his home state and throughout the West for advocacy of the American System.

In 1831, Henry Clay returned to the Senate and emerged as the leader of the National Republican party, which later became the Whig Party. He lost a bid for the presidency in 1832, but figured prominently in Jackson's and Biddle's Bank War and the Tariff of 1833.

After vetoing the bill to recharter the Second Bank of the United States, Jackson took steps to crush the bank by withdrawing the crucial deposits of federal money. He instructed the Secretary of the Treasury William Duane to do so but Duane would not comply so Jackson replaced him with the more pliant
Roger B. Taney. Taney promptly put the federal funds in the Girard Bank of Philadelphia.
Henry Clay responded to this by proposing on December 26, 1833, that the Senate censure Jackson for overstepping his authority. On March 28, 1834, the Senate adopted Clay's recommendation by a vote of 26 to 20.

Clay's perhaps most notable achievement came in the Compromise of 1850, in which the ""Great Pacificator"" or ""Great Compromiser"" managed temporarily to tame sectional passions. The Whig Party lasted only a short while following Clay's death, but their ideas, particularly the American System, were taken over by the new Republican Party.

Henry Clay did not have much time to live after the Compromise of 1850. He spent the summer of 1851 as his estate Ashland. Although dying of tuberculosis, he returned to Washington and made another appearance in the Senate, but afterwards was confined to his room in the National Hotel, where he died on June 29, 1852.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/823880097692783/?type=3,2015-04-12 07:15:12,13,0,2,13,0,0,0,0,0
428053320608798_823878107692982,"Good Sunday Morning!

Before or after the Hillary Tsunami....

What an ""Action Packed"" Week Ahead!

>Today will mark the first day of ""Hillary Rising"".  The mystery is over.  Her theme? Will center on boosting economic security for the middle class and expanding opportunities for working families, while casting the former senator and secretary of state as a ""tenacious fighter"" able to get results, two senior advisers said Saturday.

We will get a chance to hear her many accents, and trials as well as tribulations.  Because she always feels ""no ways tard"".  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGDm4jkDbGQ

President Barack Obama feels: ""I think she would be an excellent president.""

>Sen. Marco Rubio getting his big moment on Monday at just about the same time Hillary Clinton dominates the news cycle.  Probably pretty good luck for him.  The ability to build a ""stealth"" momentum might benefit him better than the continual attacks met by Rand Paul last week.  

So my question is:  Was it better to come before the tsunami or after?

Last week the press went in a couple directions regarding Rand Paul.  The first was to paint him with one stroke of the brush as ""strange"".  Pictures of him sitting half dressed in a suit from the waist up and shorts from the waist down, or looking confused on the metro.....  did nothing to bolster his ""I'm just like you"" image that was probably hoped for.......  Instead these pics were run without caption.  Then...... the article entitled ""What Makes Rand Paul Strange""  which had nothing to do with his personality only his views on childhood vaccinations.  AND then, instead of analyzing the man's stance with the eye to the fact that he has many people who sympathize with his views.....  the author also brands him as: ""By not going that extra philosophical mile — and adding junk science to the mix — Paul comes off as merely weird..""

Then, not to be outdone according to the the Atlantic posits that  he is ""wacky""  but they mean it in a ""loving way"":

 ""Rand Paul has some extreme—even wacky—views on issues that media professionals tend not to understand or care about, like monetary policy, or have discounted as an inescapable feature of the American political landscape, like guns. But because Paul deviates from what's seen as conservative orthodoxy on foreign policy, drugs, and policing, he benefits from a perception that his views are new, different, interesting, and potentially even appealing across party lines"".

And don't forget that he is also ""mean to girls"" as they point back to an interview in which: ""He famously rebuked CNBC host Kelly Evans, saying:  ""You have taken an interview and made an interview into something where we got no useful information because you were argumentative and you started out with so many prepositions (sic) that were incorrect.""

He was right, in his assessment.

Oh boy......  the article proclaiming him weird and strange also made mention of his propensity to be mean to girls also....  This will also be brought out by the Hillary machine which has already started with an unrecognizable photograph of Chelsea Clinton on the cove of Elle magazine.   Chelsea Clinton talks to ELLE regarding her perfect baby, perfect marriage and the need for a woman in the White House.In a photo entitled ""Lookin' good, girl!""  the magazine states in the best 1950's ""girl talk""  fashion:

 "" The new mom, 34, showed off her small frame in skinny jeans and a blue T-shirt. The former first daughter also strapped on brown cowboy boots and gave a glance of her gorgeous wedding band.""

Mind you, the article was supposed to speak about shattering the glass ceiling and putting a woman in the White House .... in a leadership role.  How fortunate the flexibility of this campaign (smile).  Notice Hillary was not wearing the skinny jeans.

So the week before, Ted Cruz was deemed ""unelectable"", then Rand Paul was determined to be ""strange, wacky and weird"", Rubio will have his own theme tomorrow (and if you know the press it won't be flattering), but I ask you.......  What do you think Hillary Rodham Clinton's theme will be?",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/823873267693466/?type=3,2015-04-12 07:08:01,16,4,10,16,0,0,0,0,0

It Was Never About YOUR Freedom....... Silly boys and girls!

The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. See U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In other words, the laws of a state must treat an individual in the same manner as others in similar conditions and circumstances.  

The equal protection clause is not intended to provide ""equality"" among individuals or classes but only ""equal application"" of the laws. 

Soooooo......On the one hand:

A Colorado judge today determined that a Lakewood bakery unlawfully discriminated against a gay couple by refusing to sell them a wedding cake.

David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited Masterpiece Cakeshop last year, with Craig's mother, to order a cake for their upcoming wedding reception. Mullins and Craig planned to marry in Massachusetts and then celebrate with family and friends back home in Colorado. Masterpiece owner Jack Phillips informed them that because of his religious beliefs the store's policy was to deny service to customers who wished to order baked goods to celebrate a same-sex couple's wedding.

""Being denied service by Masterpiece Cakeshop was offensive and dehumanizing especially in the midst of arranging what should be a joyful family celebration,"" said Mullins. ""No one should fear being turned away from a public business because of who they are. We are grateful to have the support of our community and our state, and we hope that today's decision will help ensure that no one else will experience this kind of discrimination again in Colorado.""http://aclu-co.org/court-rules-bakery-illegally-discriminated-against-gay-couple/

But then on the other hand:

A Denver bakery has found itself at the center of an LGBT rights controversy. But this isn't about another bakery refusing to fulfill an order for a same-sex wedding. Instead, Azucar Bakery in Denver is the subject of a Colorado civil rights investigation for declining to decorate a cake with an anti-gay message.

A customer, identified as Bill Jack, told reporters that he believes Azucar Bakery ""discriminated"" against him ""based on my creed,"" which is Christian. He filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division some time last year, though according to his statement to reporters, Jack said he wouldn't comment on the specifics of the complaint. But the baker in question did.
Jack walked into Azucar Bakery last March and asked for two cakes, both in the shape of Bibles. That wasn't a problem for Marjorie Silva, the bakery's owner. It was what Jack wanted her to write on the cake: Anti-gay phrases including ""God hates gays"" and an image of two men holding hands, covered in a big, red ""X.""
""It's unfair that he's accusing me of discriminating when I think he was the one that is discriminating,"" Silva told NBC affiliate KUSA. She said she refused to inscribe the cakes with the requested messages and soon after received notice from the state's Department of Regulatory Agencies that she was the subject of a religious discrimination complaint.http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/01/22/this-colorado-baker-refused-to-put-an-anti-gay-message-on-cakes-now-she-is-facing-a-civil-rights-complaint/

So, we know how the first case ended...... what about the second?

Using the commission's logic – if a Christian baker is forced to violate his beliefs, shouldn't all bakers be forced to violate theirs, too?

Absolutely not, says the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.
It ruled that Azucar did not discriminate against Jack based on his creed. It argued that the bakery refused to make the cakes because of the ""derogatory language and imagery,"" The Denver Channel reported. 
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/07/colorado-double-standard-bakers-should-not-be-forced-to-make-anti-gay-cakes/

428053320608798_819604994786960,"Martin Luther King Jr. was an American Baptist minister, activist, humanitarian, and leader in the African-American Civil Rights Movement. Wikipedia

Born: January 15, 1929, Atlanta, GA
Spouse: Coretta Scott King (m. 1953–1968)
Assassinated: April 4, 1968, Memphis, TN

King had arrived in Tennessee on Wednesday, 3 April to prepare for a march the following Monday on behalf of striking Memphis sanitation workers. As he prepared to leave the Lorraine Motel for a dinner at the home of Memphis minister Samuel ''Billy'' Kyles, King stepped out onto the balcony of room 306 to speak with Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) colleagues standing in the parking area below. An assassin ﬁred a single shot that caused severe wounds to the lower right side of his face. SCLC aides rushed to him, and Ralph Abernathy cradled King's head. Others on the balcony pointed across the street toward the rear of a boarding house on South Main Street where the shot seemed to have originated. An ambulance rushed King to St. Joseph's Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead at 7:05 P.M. 

President Lyndon B. Johnson called for a national day of mourning to be observed on 7 April. In the following days, public libraries, museums, schools, and businesses were closed, and the Academy Awards ceremony and numerous sporting events were postponed. On 8 April King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and other family members joined thousands of participants in a march in Memphis honoring King and supporting the sanitation workers. King's funeral service was held the following day in Atlanta at Ebenezer Baptist Church. It was attended by many of the nation's political and civil rights leaders, including Jacqueline Kennedy, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and Ralph Bunche. Morehouse College President Benjamin Mays delivered the eulogy, predicting that King ''would probably say that, if death had to come, I am sure there was no greater cause to die for than ﬁghting to get a just wage for garbage collectors'' (Mays, 9 April 1968). Over 100,000 mourners followed two mules pulling King's cofﬁn through the streets of Atlanta. After another ceremony on the Morehouse campus, King's body was initially interred at South-View Cemetery. Eventually, it was moved to a crypt next to the Ebenezer Church at the King Center, an institution founded by King's widow. 

Shortly after the assassination, a policeman discovered a bundle containing a 30.06 Remington riﬂe next door to the boarding house. The largest investigation in Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) history led its agents to an apartment in Atlanta. Fingerprints uncovered in the apartment matched those of James Earl Ray, a fugitive who had escaped from a Missouri prison in April 1967. FBI agents and police in Memphis produced further evidence that Ray had registered on 4 April at the South Main Street roominghouse and that he had taken a second-ﬂoor room near a common bathroom with a view of the Lorraine Motel. 

The identiﬁcation of Ray as a suspect led to an international manhunt. On 19 July 1968, Ray was extradited to the United States from Britain to stand trial. In a plea bargain, Tennessee prosecutors agreed in March 1969 to forgo seeking the death penalty when Ray pled guilty to murder charges. The circumstances leading to the plea later became a source of controversy, when Ray recanted his confession soon after being sentenced to a 99-year term in prison. 

During the years following King's assassination, doubts about the adequacy of the case against Ray were fueled by revelations of the extensive surveillance of King by the FBI and other government agencies. Beginning in 1976, the House Select Committee on Assassinations, chaired by Representative Louis Stokes, re-examined the evidence concerning King's assassination, as well as that of President John F. Kennedy. The committee's ﬁnal report suggested that Ray may have had co-conspirators. The report nonetheless concluded that there was no convincing evidence of government complicity in King's assassination. 

After recanting his guilty plea, Ray continued to maintain his innocence, claiming to have been framed by a gun-smuggler he knew as ''Raoul.'' In 1993 Ray's lawyer, William F. Pepper, sought to build popular support to reopen Ray's case by staging a televised mock trial of Ray in which the ''jury'' found him not guilty. In 1997 members of King's family publicly supported Ray's appeal for a new trial, and King's son Dexter Scott King supported Ray's claims innocence during a televised prison encounter. Despite this support Tennessee authorities refused to reopen the case, and Ray died in prison on 23 April 1998.

Even after Ray's death, conspiracy allegations continued to surface. In 1999, on behalf of King's widow and children, Pepper won a token civil verdict of wrongful death against Lloyd Jowers, owner of Jim's Grill, a restaurant across the street from the Lorraine Motel. Although the trial produced considerable testimony that contradicted the original case against Ray, the Justice Department announced in 2000 that its own internal investigation, launched in 1998 at the King family's request, had failed to ﬁnd sufﬁcient evidence to warrant a further investigation.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/819604284787031/?type=3,2015-04-04 08:17:37,29,3,22,29,0,0,0,0,0

Phenomenal Woman Poem by Maya Angelou

Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
But when I start to tell them,
They think I'm telling lies.
I say,
It's in the reach of my arms
The span of my hips,
The stride of my step,
The curl of my lips.
I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.

I walk into a room
Just as cool as you please,
And to a man,
The fellows stand or
Fall down on their knees.
Then they swarm around me,
A hive of honey bees.
I say,
It's the fire in my eyes,
And the flash of my teeth,
The swing in my waist,
And the joy in my feet.
I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.

Men themselves have wondered
What they see in me.
They try so much
But they can't touch
My inner mystery.
When I try to show them
They say they still can't see.
I say,
It's in the arch of my back,
The sun of my smile,
The ride of my breasts,
The grace of my style.
I'm a woman

Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.

Now you understand
Just why my head's not bowed.
I don't shout or jump about
Or have to talk real loud.
When you see me passing
It ought to make you proud.
I say,
It's in the click of my heels,
The bend of my hair,
the palm of my hand,
The need of my care,
'Cause I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.

Black Saturday....

Last night we went to a production of the Stations of the Cross by our church in Fort Lauderdale.  It was well done as most everything they do.  The church was made to look like ancient Israel and we were led from one room to another as the individual players from the congregant played played people of the Bible giving their living testimony.  Most poignant was the performance of ""Mary"".  

On this day, the Blessed Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Sorrows is assigned the title Our Lady of Solitude, referring to her solace and grief at the death of her son Jesus.

Black Saturday, or Easter Eve,and called ""Joyous Saturday"" or ""the Saturday of Light"" among Coptic Christians, is the day after Good Friday. It is the day before Easter and the last day of Holy Week in which Christians prepare for Easter. It commemorates the day that Jesus Christ's body lay in the tomb and the Harrowing of Hell.Wikipedia

428053320608798_818790404868419,"Good Friday Morning!

The Mob...

According to the accounts in the Gospels, the Temple Guards, guided by Jesus' disciple Judas Iscariot, arrested Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Judas received money (30 pieces of silver)  for betraying Jesus and told the guards that whomever he kisses is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was brought to the house of Annas, the father-in-law of the high priest,Caiaphas. There he was interrogated with little result.

 Conflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying ""I ask you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?"" Jesus testified ambiguously, ""You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven."" The high priest condemned Jesus for blasphemy  with a sentence of death .

 Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also denied Jesus three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.   

In the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor Pontius Pilateunder charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king . Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death.

Pilate questioned Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of Galilee, King Herod, who was in Jerusalem for the Passover Feast. Herod questioned Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found guilt in Jesus; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released.  Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked mercy for Barabbas, who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. 

Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, ""Crucify him"".
  
Pilate's wife had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to ""have nothing to do with this righteous man"" . Pilate had Jesus flogged and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death ""because he claimed to be God's son."" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came.

Coming before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he has no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot  and ultimately to keep his job. 
 
Cheese and crackers, how little human nature has changed.  First, the mob or the crowd of public opinion will always be more exaggerated and more irrational than when an individual is set with the responsibility of making an important decision or acting in a rational manner......  In the Biblical time, saving Barrabas, a very bad man (I mean murder and insurrection is pretty serious stuff) was more palatable to the irrational mob than considering the plight of a Man whose only ""crime"" could be that he was the son of God.  In addition,  the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, KNEW within his heart that this was an innocent ma, yet in order to assuage his own ambitions and give in to the crowd, he sacrificed a Man much better than himself.  

So how is this much different than today?  As I said, human nature is still the same....... ambition, greed, fear, cowardice and self absorption are all part of the human landscape.  We saw this played out in Ferguson Missouri where the mob influenced a suspension of truth, integrity, and decency.  We witnessed people looting and burning out their own homes, unwilling to tell the truth that their ""lying"" eyes allowed them to see.  We witnessed this ""mob mentality"" spread across the nation with lawmakers, sports stars, musicians, adults and children alike flinging their hands in the air and acting on a street thug's fantastical lie.  We witnessed doctors testifying to a scenario regarding the dead teenager that they knew in their hearts was not true.  We saw the mob calling for the head of an innocent man whose life will be forever changed by this miscarriage of justice.

What else do we see today?  Well, just in the same manner that Peter,denied Jesus three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted, our religious leaders remain silent on any and all matters of Faith in the public arena.  Part of it is fiscal concerns......  many of them have become salaried ""churchers"".......  meaning that the business of running a church is very expensive and we would not want to lessen the coffers.  The ""show"" must go on.....  after all, the music, lights and backdrops cost money. Stepping out means the possibility of offending which would bring the show to a grinding halt.  In this case many of them have really outdone Peter..... in the number of denials that is.

And finally, mercy.  We have all fallen short of the glory of God.  Next week the 11 teachers and administrators who were caught cheating will undergo sentencing for racketeering.  Hmmmmmmm don't you think we are going a weeee bit too far with this?  Now hear me out.... it was wrong BUT, we will jail teachers who with some supervision, say for 5 years or so, they could ""give back"".  The President lessened the sentence for drug dealers...... who will go back to selling dope as soon as they find their ""hook up"" - it is after all their profession; A bunch of Taliban and Al Queda are running around loose in the Middle East plotting their next caper; Harry Reid lied like a rug in the chamber and then said ""so what""; Susan Rice lies every time a camera is pointed in her face; Hillary Clinton is still the front-runner for President of the United States soooooooo.......  Given the fact that the Atlanta 11 at least will impart a level of ""value"" to society – they are educated teachers who will at least have remorse..... when compared to the latter.......  should we not beg for ""mercy""?

The Shadow of Betrayal

Thursday before Easter. Also referred to as ""Holy Thursday"" or ""Great Thursday"" in some Christian denominations,Maundy Thursday Commemorates the Last Supper when Jesus shared the Passover meal with his disciples on the night before he was crucified. In contrast to joyful Easter celebrations when Christians worship their resurrected Savior,Maundy Thursday services are typically more solemn occasions, marked by the shadow of Jesus' betrayal.Wikipedia

The Importance of Money in the Betrayal......

Judas Iscariot questioned whether or not Jesus was indeed the Messiah.   Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve original disciples of Jesus Christ, and son of Simon Iscariot. He is known for the  kiss and betrayal of Jesus to the Sanhedrin for thirty silver coins.  When we get angry and call someone a ""Judas""  it is regarding his name –--it often invoked to accuse someone of betrayal. The kiss is the distraction ..... now known as the ""kiss of death"".

One can, however, look at Judas' betrayal, fast setting in motion the events that led to Jesus' Crucifixion and Resurrection, which, according to traditional Christian theology, brought salvation to humanity.

OK, but back to the ""betrayal"", which is central to to solemnity of Maundy Thursday.  This week I had a discussion with a friend who belongs to a church denomination that is taking a vote on the ""definition of marriage"".  One of my favorite lines of Scripture in Proverbs is:

Proverbs 30:18-19 
18 ""There are three things that are too amazing for me, four that I do not understand: 19the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a maiden.

Such beautiful words, evoking in me  a picture of the most natural of all combinations, a man and a woman – the only combination to which natural  procreation is a gift.  In my prayers one of the things that I ask for is the ""God Blessed"", loving and respectful union of my daughters with a God-fearing, hard working man like their father loves and honors them.
 
Now, here is where it gets tricky, does this mean that we hate the homosexual?  Not at all.  Never hate.  But as we conform ourselves to the ways of the world, unless we re-write the Bible and name it the gospel according to Michael Green or Mary Smith, voting to change and integral of the Word is well convoluted thinking.  The law provides for marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman but the Bible does not.  You either have a  Bible based church or a spiritual ""based"" social group..... not both.  How much more important is the Bible than ""Moby Dick"", but the ""real smart"" scholars would step up, balk and speak up if we changed the name of ""Moby Dick"" to ""Moby Charles"".  I remember the angst that some people went through over the colorization of some of the classic movies, but changing the Gospel of the origins of man..... nary a hue nor cry. 

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says he does not plan to sign the religious freedom bill that sits on his desk right now, instead asking state lawmakers to make changes so the bill mirrors federal law. The first-term Republican governor said he wants his state ""to be known as a state that does not discriminate but understands tolerance.""
 
Who says that (1) people of Faith naturally want to discriminate and (2) are intolerant by nature?  He also speaks of a generation gap as if all young people think this way also.  

Hutchinson's decision comes in the wake of an uproar in Indiana, where Gov. Mike Pence has faced pressure from businesses, sports associations like the NCAA and popular culture figures to backtrack on a similar religious freedom law he signed last week. In Arkansas, it's been Wal-Mart applying the most pressure. 

So as in the Biblical times, the ""betrayal"" of the rights of people who feel that their right to religious freedom is being trampled and negated by those who believe that they have the right to call you intolerant or worse if they are not allowed to suppress YOU.  …...... all of this comes back to the betrayal of Jesus to the Sanhedrin for thirty silver coins........ because when these corporations get involved, they are telling you that you won't get your thirty silver coins without the betrayal of your Faith, your Lord  and ultimately your religious freedoms.  Just think, the cheap sneakers, plastic shoes and stretch pants at Wal Mart instead of salvation.......  Your Rights End Where Mine Begin. 

On this solemn day of betrayal, where are the brave clergy boldly speaking up for the flock set asunder under the press of secularism disguised as ""political correctness""?  I have watched the ""prosperity princes"" beg for money from their congregation to buy new planes... all from people, some of which,  who don't have enough to make a proper Sunday meal.  They have television shows, radio broadcasts,  newsletters, websites and the like where they show off their ""arm guns"" from lifting weights, and preach the coolest sermons about …..... anything safe and  removed and non-disruptive of the flow of the modern thirty silver coins. 

So, in this shadow of betrayal, let us find our voice.   ""Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's""  that is your right under God.

 I support religious liberty.  I also support anti-discrimination laws.   Religious liberty took a big hit in a 1990 Supreme Court decision that went against American Indians fired after they ingested a hallucinogen in a Native American Church ritual. A law can prohibit any form of worship, Justice Antonin Scalia argued for the majority, as long as it is ""neutral (and) generally applicable."" 


Outraged over this reasoning, which would have outlawed using wine at the Catholic Mass during Prohibition, Congress responded (nearly unanimously) in 1993 with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Signed by President Clinton, this act instructed the judiciary to return to its prior approach, in which burdens on individual religious liberty would be unlawful unless the government could show that the burden was necessary to achieve a ""compelling government interest"" and that the law doing so employed the ""least restrictive means.""

Cheating Yourself.

The phrase man bites dog is a shortened version of an aphorism in journalism which describes how an unusual, infrequent event is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences, such as a dog biting a person (""dog bites man""). 

Often life is like that.....  unusual.  You know ""you can't make the stuff up"" kind of unusual.  This often occurs when an incentive for ""unusual"" behavior is present.  For example, when a kid cheats on an exam, when he/she ""cuts and pastes"" on papers or essays, or various and sundry other childhood short-cuts..... there is no story.  BUT that all changes when you find teachers cheating for students.  Now, that is a story!

Take for example, the Atlanta cheating scandal.    The Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal refers to the accusation that teachers and principals in the Atlanta Public Schools (APS) district cheated on state-administered standardized tests, and the subsequent fallout. Wikipedia

 Teachers who confessed to cheating blamed ""inordinate pressure"" to meet targets set by the district and said they faced severe consequences such as a negative evaluation or termination if they didn't. A state report that began in the summer of 2010 found that 44 of 56 Atlanta public schools investigated cheated on the 2009 CRCT, or Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests, a set of tests administered at Georgia public elementary schools to test students in a variety of subjects. The report implicated 38 principals and 140 teachers. 

Apparently, cheating on the 2009 CRCT was originally noticed by the Georgia Office of Student Achievement, when too many incorrect answers were erased and changed to the right answers. Award-winning gains by Atlanta students were based on widespread cheating  .

The investigation tarnishes the 12-year tenure of Superintendent Beverly Hall, who was named US Superintendent of the Year in 2009 largely because of the school system's reported gains – especially in inner-city schools. Beverly Hall recently died due to breast cancer as dozens of educators stood trial for a cheating scandal that happened during her tenure as head of the school district. 

In Atlanta on Wednesday, the city's schoolchildren learned an important lesson by watching what a jury said about some of the school district's former educators.

 Eleven former Atlanta Public Schools educators were convicted of racketeering for their roles in one of the most brazen and pervasive school cheating scandals ever uncovered. They could face years in prison. Another 21 Atlanta educators already had reached plea deals with prosecutors, admitting their roles in the wrongdoing. The defendants, including teachers, a principal and other administrators, were accused of falsifying test results to collect bonuses or keep their jobs in the 50,000-student Atlanta school system. A 12th defendant, a teacher, was acquitted of all charges by the jury.

The racketeering charges carry up to 20 years in prison. Most of the defendants will be sentenced April 8

The only one allowed to remain free on bail was teacher Shani Robinson, because she is expected to give birth soon. 

For many public school teachers, the treatment of teachers in Atlanta is disturbingly familiar : Fear, abuse, threats, retaliation, cover-up, nepotism, misappropriated funds, being asked, ""Are you a member of my team?"" discovering that your grades were arbitrarily changed, and, in each case, facing the anguishing choice that was really no choice at all: ""Should I report it and risk retaliation or go along and keep quiet – while it eats away at me?""

Great Monday.

 ""Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.""

Today is Great Monday of the Holy Week leading up to Easter.  For those not interested in scripture, understand that I am not ""preaching"" to you.  I am not qualified to do so.  But it is important that you keep an open mind....

Holy Monday, Tuesday, and  Wednesday .........so often the Holy Week is considered one of the beautiful traditions"" or ""customs"", a self evident ""part"" of our calendar. We take it for granted and enjoy it.   

They were ""normal"" men who shouted, ""Crucify Him!"", who spat on Him and nailed Him to the Cross. They hated and killed Him precisely because He was troubling their normal life. It was indeed a perfectly ""normal"" world which preferred darkness and death to light and life. By the death of Jesus, this ""normal"" world, this ""normal"" life was irrevocably condemned, or rather, they revealed their true and abnormal nature ie their inability to receive the - ""Now is the judgement of this world."" (John 12:31). The Pascha (Passover) of Jesus signified its end to ""this world"" and it has been at its end since then. This end can last for hundreds of centuries; this does not alter the nature of time in which we live as the ""last time."" The ""fashion of this world passes away...""(1 Corinthians 7:31). 

In the times in which we live, I have heard religion referred to as ""fairy dust"" and/or a ""fairytale""....... This is nothing new as there is truly nothing new under the sun.  Man and woman exist in essentially the same condition they existed in during Biblical times, for those who believe or ""ancient"" times for those who don't.

Essentially the same 5 fingers on each hand, five toes on each foot;   Same gray matter between the ears and the same reproductive parts that guarantee the next generation will be brought forth from a womb.Our organs work the same as they always did and our mind is still geared towards satisfying the ""pleasure principle""  -----   which prefers darkness and ""death"" to light and life.  What is death/  sometimes it is simply anything that denies your life light......  In the biblical sense it can be;

A proud look (Conceitedness)
A lying tongue (self explanatory)
Hands that shed innocent blood
A heart that devises wicked plots
Feet that are swift to run into mischief
A deceitful witness that uttereth lies
Him that soweth discord among brethren

But think about it.......  all of these things ..... well they are fun!  They are ""normal""......  they make us feel REAL good..... at least temporarily. And when you combine them with the right cuss words, drugs and 50 shades of gray......... we might even convince ourselves that they bring us into the ""normal light"".  

And then what.......?   The other day I found myself watching the quintessential sexy, irreverent ""Sex and the City"" re-run.....  The main character, Carrie, was obsessing about using ""email"".  I found myself fascinated that the clothes and hairstyles still looked viable but ""e-gads!"" ....... who doesn't use ""email"".  Life is impossible without it!  Technology changes, customs change but the real object of her affection did not - she wanted to get back with her old boyfriend, who she cheated of and would again.  It would not end with them together or even ""living happily ever after"" ... that was not in their stars but instead of emptiness, they would pretend 'sophisticated angst'.  Unfortunately for those late thirty-somethings and forty-somethings who are now late forty-somethings and fifty-somethings due to the passage of time...... who bought into this ""fun"" there might be a level of emptiness.......  How long can you sit in cute cafe's talking about every iteration of  sex with people who don't care anything about you before you get bored and irritated?  Not to mention alone and empty.

When my Grandmother was in hospice just 7 short years ago I saw the rooms of women and men essentially in the same condition that she was in.  This facility allowed the residents to have a picture of the patient's ""best self"".  You would be surprised how beautiful and fit the ladies once were and how handsome and ""sexy"" some of the men once were. My grandma had her picture up of her sitting on the rocks by the sea.  She looked just like my youngest daughter Austen.  Same fair skin and round face and beautiful hair (nothing like my wiry curly stuff).   I also passed the room of a very sick woman who abused drugs for years and looked much older than 35 as she was suffering from the advanced stages of AIDS and hepatitis.  Drugs were part of her ""normal"" and i guess at one point it provided a level of what she thought was ""happiness and light"" needless to say..... she had no picture on her door.

So, you ask, what's the point Angela?

The point is that during this week, regardless of your belief or lack thereof, ask yourself if what you are doing now will provide you with a level of lasting happiness and self gratification.  You began life as a baby and you will end life .... if you live long enough, with just the memories of the best you gave life.  Regardless of the changes in technology which provide you with new cheeks (both on your face and on your back), tighter skin, bigger breasts or other places I heard they are able to enhance...... you will never re-capture the essence or the effervescence of the 18 year old ingenue.  

It is time to build greater ""castles"" then  you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.""

The Importance of Carly Fiorina.

She served as chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005 and previously was an executive at AT&T and its equipment and technology spinoff, Lucent.  

She was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate from California in 2010.   If anyone is at doubt, California is a particularly one party state, with California being a virtual ATM for the President.  In other words, the are great monetary supporters for the president.  

She ran against Barbara Boxer and received 42.2% of the vote.  In addition, Fiorina served as an advisor to Republican John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.

In 1998, Fortune magazine named her the ""most powerful woman in business"" in its inaugural listing, and she was included in the Time 100 in 2004 and remained in the Fortune listing throughout her tenure at HP. Fiorina was #10 on the Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women for 2004. She became regarded by many as being the first woman to head up a Fortune 20 company, and to have overcome the metaphorical ""glass ceiling"". http://www.ask.com/wiki/Carly_Fiorina?o=2801&qsrc=999&ad=doubleDown&an=apn&ap=ask.com

Fiorina (then Cara Carleton Sneed) married Todd Bartlem, a Stanford classmate, in June 1977. They divorced in 1984.In 1985, she married AT&T executive Frank Fiorina. It was the second marriage for both. She helped to raise his two daughters Traci and Lori Ann. They attempted to have children together but, as Fiorina puts it: ""That wasn't God's plan.""

We share a number of things in common, but this one in particular is most key in my mind....:  

On February 20, 2009, Fiorina was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent a double mastectomy at Stanford Hospital on March 2, 2009, followed by chemotherapy, which caused her to temporarily lose her hair, and later radiation therapy.(Keep in mind that this was the election cycle)  

 She was given ""an excellent prognosis for a full recovery.""""Carly Fiorina has surgery for breast cancer"". San Francisco Chronicle. Retrieved Mar 20, 2009.

Early in her campaign for the United States Senate seat held by Barbara Boxer, Fiorina told a group of supporters: ""I have to say that after chemotherapy, Barbara Boxer just isn't that scary anymore.""

This is a fearless woman of accomplishment, a ""can do "" spirit and the capability of forging her own path.  We should embrace this in the Republican Party.

A Woman's Role.

I frequently change the picture board of this Facebook page in order to commemorate the passage of something significant in history or just to me.  Some of you like the picture, some have questions about it and some outright hate it, however, the main idea is that you simply think about it.  

Todays picture involves the WAAF.  The WAAF - Women's Auxiliary Air Force was formed this month  in 1938, the year before World War Two began. It was originally organised as a support force of women volunteer charged with carrying on the work of the Air Transport Auxiliary which was subsumed as part of the WAAF.

WAAF numbers exceeded 180,000 at its peak in 1943, with over 2,000 women enlisting per week.  Day to day life and prospects were limited for women in that era and many women felt that they wanted to play a part or 'do their bit' for the pre-war effort and quickly joined the WAAF upon its official formation on 28th June 1939, in search of adventure but mainly because they felt the call to be doing something to support their country.

The uniform was a draw for some women, or at least that is what they stated at the time.  They traded in their petticoats and frillies to wear a proper uniform.  They had a chance to do something ""less ordinary"" and look ""less ordinary"" as well.

The early publicity for the WAAF advised women that their jobs would fall under three main roles -Driving, Clerical and Administrative Duties and finally.... Cooking.  Joining the WAAF must have seemed like an adventure, however, basically, they would be serving airmen from the various RAF (Royal Air Force) bases in the United Kingdom.

Although their role was primarily listed as support, these women were not ""shrinking violets""  for example, during the war 12 WAAF pilots lost their lives, in Reconnaissance Operatives, they analysed  photographs of German targets. and never forget Eileen Younghusband who filtered through to the German's Big Ben message threatening the bombing of London by V2 bombers..... or Noor Inayat Khan, Agent Phono who died at the hands of the Nazis after working covertly as a radio operator in France during the German occupation.

So why this story above others?  Well, a couple of weeks ago I published the picture of Betty Friedan because the Feminine Mystique was published February 19, 1963.  A number of people ""disliked"" me perhaps because of this but it does not negate the fact that this book was a singularly important body of work .... especially for women.   ""The Feminine Mystique begins with an introduction describing what Friedan called ""the problem that has no name""—the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s and early 1960s. It discusses the lives of several housewives from around the United States who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being married with children.""  

Prior to this time, it was assumed that although it was necessary for men to achieve and explore, women were content in the most basic biological roles.  Those that did not find contentment there were assumed to be ""mannish"" or lesbians or emotionally disturbed.... not just simply ambitious, curious or intelligent.  The rise of one gender will and should never denigrate the other ... but rather enhance it for both genders... that is.

So, I watch women even today give over their ""power"" and comfort themselves with being beautiful ""playthings"" for men.  They do this until it is too late and they realize that as they content themselves with being a ""thing"", they become replaced by a cuter ""thing""........ because ""things"" have no intrinsic value.

Further, I read the latest sex discrimination case this morning, noting that the woman, Ellen Pao, lost.  The company,Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, should not be so cocky because in losing, she won and in winning..... they lost.  How so,   In vanquishing their female foe, the venerable venture-capital firm took a PR thumping with countless embarrassing disclosures in court that buttress her argument and painted it in a chauvinistic light.  The locker-room mentality, the lewd and bawdy behavior towards women...... they will lose eventually... they have won the battle not the war.   The reputation of the tech and financial industries' notorious exclusion of women at their highest ranks – a depressing trend underscored by a new study that shows the gender gap in technology is widening as women are being held back by stereotypes and biases.  This continues on.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/03/27/ellen-pao-sex-discrimination-case-kleiner-perkins-trial/70484588/

So, what does this have to do with politics?  Plenty.  As I drive my many miles to work every morning, the venerable ""Ready for Hillary"" bumper-stickers stare me in the face at every traffic light.  Precisely what are they ready for?  This is where everything gets tricky.......  most people know how slippery and generally unaccomplished this woman's term in her various office positions has been.  The shrill laugh at inappropriate times, the changing accents --- from high-brow to black slave woman as she declares herself ""tard"" instead of ""tired"" when she performs in front of Black audiences. We listen in horror as she states incorrectly that she landed in Iraq under heavy gun-fire and had to run for her life.  One might even imagine the pastel polyester pants suit propelling those legs through the sands of the desert as she runs for cover....... Maybe....

But the real knee-jerk reaction is to ""wait for her"" because she is a woman.  And we want to see the ""underdog"" come ahead...  In this case, the ""underdog"" is a woman.... and she is Hillary.  Right?

Wrong........  Tomorrow I will write a bit about MY ""waiting for"" moment and the person I would like to speak about is......

Out of the night that covers me,
      Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
      For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
      I have not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears

428053320608798_815548388525954,"Good Friday Evening!

The Essential and Non-Essential...... in Human Nature,

I love dogs.  I really do.  My dogs, two English Bull Dogs - Winston Churchill and Sir Harry are among the most lovable dogs on the planet.  They play, they stare, the snore......loudly at my bedroom door.  But they play no real purpose --- except for me.  However, I attended a gala tonight to benefit a charity that trains dogs to help the handicapped.  People who either had spinal cord injuries or were born with cerebral palsy would benefit from the training of these smart and ""essential"" dogs.  These dogs are ""essential"" for these people to live independent and mobile lives.  These animals are smart, calm and attentive to ""their"" people who so depend upon them.  The evening was life affirming and essential. 

Another thing that happened to me today was that I received notification from many of you that there is an ugly accusation out on an obscure website regarding an allegation that Allen West sexually harassed two women.  This allegation was quickly promulgated by a local talk person by the name of Joyce Kaufman and she is complicit.  Joyce has a small show that is juxtaposed with Rush Limbaugh so it is imperative that she creates local ""buzz"" in order to garner an audience. She is approximately 20 years older than my husband and myself (graduating from Roosevelt High-School when we were in pre-school) and a grandmother/great-grandmother (Bubbles?) many, many, many, many times over.

Over the past 6 years my husband, myself and our children have been targeted by this woman for reasons only known to her, but that have primarily centred around a job that she felt she should have gotten as a ""chief of staff"" in the year 2009.  Not getting the job and the ability to race through the corridors to the Capital and possibly the White House creating mayhem proved to be a ""bitter pill"" for this perpetually miserable talk show maven.  

As people do, we moved on to different things and different jobs.  Kaufman supposedly jumped out of a moving plane, married again, had a new grandchild on the West Coast, stood in the pouring rain and mud of Port St. Lucie protesting Marco Rubio (we did not know she was out there until the flood watch was announced) and tried to continue burning her torch for a job never had and harassing the West family by utilizing the air waves of WFTL in Fort Lauderdale.The amazing thing is that she has managed to confuse the conservative members of the electorate, promote the destruction of the Republican Party in South Florida and ensure the election of liberals.  All while speaking up for the Tea Party (smile).  All non-essential.  
 
We moved back to Fort Lauderdale, bought a new place in Texas, near to Allen's new position and  forged new careers while taking care of our family, making new friends, doing charity work and making sure that our children get a good start in life.  In addition to our ""regular"" children, we have managed to support an IDF soldier through college as well as two Chinese exchange students.   We have supported conservative causes and conservative candidates AND helped them get elected..  This is what we do.  We move on, we do better and aim higher.

So, now the question ........Angela....did it happen?  Nope. What did happen was simply this.....  My daughter said that she is  tired of Joyce targeting our family.  Making statements, horning in on our lives.  Both girls have had to endure this human since they were in the 5th and 8th grades.  They are now seniors in college and high school.  We have lived under the spectre of humiliation by this ""on air"" ""personality"" that is obsessed with in her words ""ruining"" and willing to use the air waves of a radio station to do so. 

Bottom line, putting up with the bitter bile of this person  is intolerable to my husband, my children and me ... we are one.  The last line of insult that any person of color will ever have to deal with is sexual allegations.  You see this is what people who want to ruin Black people do...... they make a sexual allegation....  Herman Cain and Jennifer Carroll are the latest targets in recent years.  This will not stand.....  

I am unafraid and a difficult person when necessary.

Where in the World is Bowe Bergdahl?

In June 2009, Bergdahl left his base in eastern Afghanistan. Deserted.  It's been nearly a year since Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl returned to the United States as part of a prisoner exchange and since the Army began a formal investigation into his disappearance from his unit. 

The Army still hasn't made public its findings. In January the Army stated that a decision on whether to charge Bergdahl -- and what those charges would be -- could come ""very soon, imminently."" But no decision has been announced.Gen. Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command, who will decide what to do.... next.

So...... what's taking soooooo long?

National Security Adviser Susan Rice said last June that Bergdahl ""served the United States with honor and distinction.""  Her perspective on MANY things --- NIgeria and Benghazi... to name just two, are very ""other-worldly/unique""  so I would not put too much credence to that statement. 

Bergdahl, who's now 28, was taken by the Haqqani terrorist network. But the circumstances of Bergdahl's departure from his base and how willingly he left have not been clear.Some members of Bergdahl's platoon have criticized him, labeling Bergdahl a deserter.

""I was pissed off then, and I am even more so now with everything going on,"" former Sgt. Matt Vierkant, a member of Bergdahl's platoon when he went missing on June 30, 2009, told CNN last year. ""Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war, and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him.""

Bergdahl was freed in May when President Barack Obama agreed to swap five Taliban prisoners who had been detained in Guantanamo Bay to secure Bergdahl's freedom, sending those detainees to Qatar.  And he was promoted..... and awarded back pay..... and his parents sashayed into the White House --- Mom wore a cute dress and Dad, a Taliban beard.  Quite a ""hero's welcome"" in the White House Rose Garden.

His hometown of Hailey, Idaho, had planned a parade to celebrate Bergdahl's homecoming but later canceled that celebration.  A couple of the released contacted their old Taliban crew....... but Bob and Jani Bergdahl had a wonderful time with the President.

Bergdahl has remained on active duty at an administrative job at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. There, the Army assigned Bergdahl a ""sponsor"" to help him adjust to life in his new post.   He has been spotted enjoying a bite to eat and shopping.  

Seems a bit unfair...... doesn't it?

 The families of other U.S. hostages taken by terror groups have complained that the Bergdahl swap also suggested there's a price American leaders are willing to pay in exchange for the safe return of U.S. citizen.  

Remember those terrorists we sent back to Yemen for their safekeeping and tracking?

What will happen to them now that Yemen may have bigger ""fish to fry"" in the way of its very own civil war brewing up?   No one really knows where these five are. 

Remember, they made it clear that the 5 blokes would not return to Al Qaeda.......  Why would they?  The 5 guys have ties to the Taliban NOT Al Qaeda........ a little detail that was left out.... Just a little one.

If we think about it, however, we might deduce that the five guys are not in the burger business nor have they taken up milk and honey farming.......

So..... back to the original question.....

 The misperception of Reagan endures among his political critics.

Reveling in retelling some of Reagan's more notorious misstatements of fact during his years in the White House, Hitchens concludes, ""He was dumb as a stump.""

Jesse Watters set out to get answers, asking passersby if they're proud to be American, what they'd change about the nation and more.  Well, as I could have predicted, the young people he questioned for the most part were not proud.  One wanted to move to Europe, another who just recently received a school loan was not happy with the country and another still said that he was receiving food stamps but also owned a $1000.00 camera… which he proudly showed off to the interviewer – Jesse Watters.  None of them felt that they owed anyone anything and the fellow with the camera said that he felt he already gave up his ""freedom"".  So much for the American education system.

May I Just Have a Latte, Burrito and Drop my Kid off at Day Care?

Can we just stop being hassled?  Starbuck's Coffee stores  had begun writing ""Race Together"" on customers' cups, as a means of starting a racial conversation with customers, one week later…… the practice ended.  Why?  ""The campaign has been criticized as opportunistic and inappropriate, coming in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males."" http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2015/03/23/starbucks-baristas-stop-writing-race-together-on-cups/

Starbucks holds around 33 percent of the market share for coffee in the U.S. It sells almost as much coffee as do fast food and convenience stores combined, even though it the bulk of its consumers are in cities or upscale suburban areas. Starbucks' primary target market is men and women aged 25 to 40. They account for almost half (49 percent) of its total business.  Young adults, aged 18 to 24, total 40 percent of Starbucks' sales. Starbucks positions itself as a place college students can hang out, study, write term papers and meet people.  So the chain is fairly upscale, very hip and not inexpensive.

The average worker at a Starbuck's Coffee outlet is a part-timer.  At Starbucks, ""baristas"" make $8.80 an hour, on average.  Less per hour on average than WalMart……  Most of the workers at the store in my neighborhood and in some of the cities that I have visited are teens to early 20's.  So…… I ask you, on your busy morning rushing to get your favorite coffee brew, do you have as your mission, the desire to carry on a racial discussion with a local teen?

According to Chipotle, their  ""Cultivating Thought"" program ""invites all of us to stop for one minute of our busy lives and read something special. As a writer, I think we all should find our daily spot to stop and meet our thoughts.""

Quotes such as ""I love the idea of unexpected stories in unexpected places.""; ""I thought it might be a good thing to open other eyes.""; ""Have you ever run into someone with no teeth and asked, 'What happened?'""; ""'I miss them, Mami.' All those words I had to leave behind. Also, words that in English didn't carry the same feeling.""……. are supposed to make you feel …. something ….. while eating your burrito or other concoction ….  Or maybe  words written by authors like authors like Toni Morrison, Malcolm Gladwell and George Saunders will lessen the pain of eating calorie bomb quasi Mexican delights.   

One quote that I find very curious…….  ""Hope that, in future, all is well, everyone eats free, no one must work, all just sit around feeling love for one another,"" is one such insightful snippet you can expect to see on the broad side of your paper bag.
Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of their business continuity plan?  If everyone ate free and did not work…. Where would that leave Chipotles?

And finally, Bureaucrats from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will weigh and measure children in daycare as part of a study mandated by First Lady Michelle Obama's Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act.

 The agency published a notice in the Federal Register on Friday proposing data collection on what meals are served in professional and home daycare facilities and how much physical activity children perform.  Aside from assessing how healthy the food in daycare is, the USDA will also check the weight and height of roughly 3,000 children.

""Children will be asked to cooperate with study staff who will weigh and measure them for the Standing Height and Weight Form,"" the notice said.

The study is required by section 223 of Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which was championed by Mrs. Obama and passed in 2010. The main aspect of the law implemented new standards for school lunches.http://weaselzippers.us/217911-michelle-obama-mandate-to-force-daycare-providers-to-weigh-measure-children-and-report-data-to-federal-government/

428053320608798_807872349293558,"Significant in History:  In 1963, ""The Feminine Mystique"" by Betty Friedan was first published by W.W. Norton & Co

In 1957, Friedan was asked to conduct a survey of her former Smith College classmates for their 15th anniversary reunion; the results, in which she found that many of them were unhappy with their lives as housewives, prompted her to begin research for The Feminine Mystique, conducting interviews with other suburban housewives, as well as researching psychology, media, and advertising. She originally intended to publish an article on the topic, not a book, but no magazine would publish her article.

The Feminine Mystique begins with an introduction describing what Friedan called ""the problem that has no name""—the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s and early 1960s. It discusses the lives of several housewives from around the United States who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being married with children.[5]
 
Chapter 1: Friedan points out that the average age of marriage was dropping and the birthrate was increasing for women throughout the 1950s, yet the widespread trend of unhappy women persisted, although American culture insisted that fulfillment for women could be found in marriage and housewifery; this chapter concludes by declaring ""We can no longer ignore that voice within women that says: 'I want something more than my husband and my children and my home.'""[6]
 
Chapter 2: Friedan shows that the editorial decisions concerning women's magazines were being made mostly by men, who insisted on stories and articles that showed women as either happy housewives or unhappy careerists, thus creating the ""feminine mystique""—the idea that women were naturally fulfilled by devoting their lives to being housewives and mothers. Friedan notes that this is in contrast to the 1930s, at which time women's magazines often featured confident and independent heroines, many of whom were involved in careers.[7]
 
Chapter 3: Friedan recalls her own decision to conform to society's expectations by giving up her promising career in psychology to raise children, and shows that other young women still struggled with the same kind of decision. Many women dropped out of school early to marry, afraid that if they waited too long or became too educated, they would not be able to attract a husband. Friedan argues at the end of the chapter that although theorists discuss how men need to find their identity, women are expected to be autonomous. She states, ""Anatomy is woman's destiny, say the theorists of femininity; the identity of woman is determined by her biology.""[8] Friedan goes onto argue that the problem is women needing to mature and find their human identity. She argues, ""In a sense that goes beyond any woman's life, I think this is a crisis of women growing up— a turning point from an immaturity that has been called femininity to full human identity.""[8]
 
Chapter 4: Friedan discusses early American feminists and how they fought against the assumption that the proper role of a woman was to be solely a wife and mother. She notes that they secured important rights for women, including education, the right to pursue a career, and the right to vote.[9]
 
Chapter 5: Friedan, who had a degree in psychology, criticizes Sigmund Freud (whose ideas were very influential in America at the time of her book's publication). She notes that Freud saw women as childlike and as destined to be housewives, once pointing out that Freud wrote, ""I believe that all reforming action in law and education would break down in front of the fact that, long before the age at which a man can earn a position in society, Nature has determined woman's destiny through beauty, charm, and sweetness. Law and custom have much to give women that has been withheld from them, but the position of women will surely be what it is: in youth an adored darling and in mature years a loved wife."" Friedan also points out that Freud's unproven concept of ""penis envy"" had been used to label women who wanted careers as neurotic, and that the popularity of Freud's work and ideas elevated the ""feminine mystique"" of female fulfillment in housewifery into a ""scientific religion"" that most women were not educated enough to criticize.[10]
 
Chapter 6: Friedan criticizes functionalism, which attempted to make the social sciences more credible by studying the institutions of society as if they were parts of a social body, as in biology. Institutions were studied in terms of their function in society, and women were confined to their sexual biological roles as housewives and mothers as well as being told that doing otherwise would upset the social balance. Friedan points out that this is unproven and that Margaret Mead, a prominent functionalist, had a flourishing career as an anthropologist.[9]
 
Chapter 7: Friedan discusses the change in women's education from the 1940s to the early 1960s, in which many women's schools concentrated on non-challenging classes that focused mostly on marriage, family, and other subjects deemed suitable for women, as educators influenced by functionalism felt that too much education would spoil women's femininity and capacity for sexual fulfillment. Friedan says that this change in education arrested girls in their emotional development at a young age, because they never had to face the painful identity crisis and subsequent maturation that comes from dealing with many adult challenges.[9]
 
Chapter 8: Friedan notes that the uncertainties and fears during World War II and the Cold War made Americans long for the comfort of home, so they tried to create an idealized home life with father as the breadwinner and mother as the housewife.[11] Friedan notes that this was helped along by the fact that many of the women who worked during the war filling jobs previously filled by men faced dismissal, discrimination, or hostility when the men returned, and that educators blamed over-educated, career-focused mothers for the maladjustment of soldiers in World War II. Yet as Friedan shows, later studies found that overbearing mothers, not careerists, were the ones who raised maladjusted children.[9]
 
Chapter 9: Friedan shows that advertisers tried to encourage housewives to think of themselves as professionals who needed many specialized products in order to do their jobs, while discouraging housewives from having actual careers, since that would mean they would not spend as much time and effort on housework and therefore would not buy as many household products, cutting into advertisers' profits.[9]
 
Chapter 10: Friedan interviews several full-time housewives, finding that although they are not fulfilled by their housework, they are all extremely busy with it. She postulates that these women unconsciously stretch their home duties to fill the time available, because the feminine mystique has taught women that this is their role, and if they ever complete their tasks they will become unneeded.[9]
 
Chapter 11: Friedan notes that many housewives have sought fulfillment in sex, unable to find it in housework and children; Friedan notes that sex cannot fulfill all of a person's needs, and that attempts to make it do so often drive married women to have affairs or drive their husbands away as they become obsessed with sex.[9]
 
Chapter 12: Friedan discusses the fact that many children have lost interest in life or emotional growth, attributing the change to the mother's own lack of fulfillment, a side effect of the feminine mystique. When the mother lacks a self, Friedan notes, she often tries to live through her children, causing the children to lose their own sense of themselves as separate human beings with their own lives.[9]
 
Chapter 13: Friedan discusses Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and notes that women have been trapped at the basic, physiological level, expected to find their identity through their sexual role alone. Friedan says that women need meaningful work just as men do to achieve self-actualization, the highest level on the hierarchy of needs.[9]
 
Chapter 14: In the final chapter of The Feminine Mystique, Friedan discusses several case studies of women who have begun to go against the feminine mystique. She also advocates a new life plan for her women readers, including not viewing housework as a career, not trying to find total fulfillment through marriage and motherhood alone, and finding meaningful work that uses their full mental capacity. She discusses the conflicts that some women may face in this journey to self-actualization, including their own fears and resistance from others. For each conflict, Friedan offers examples of women who have overcome it. Friedan ends her book by promoting education and meaningful work as the ultimate method by which American women can avoid becoming trapped in the feminine mystique, calling for a drastic rethinking of what it means to be feminine, and offering several educational and occupational suggestions",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/807872349293558/?type=3,2015-03-13 12:47:29,5,1,4,5,0,0,0,0,0

The Color Barrier.

So, the fraternities and sororities at universities across the United States are generally color-coded.  Not only are they usually predominantly one color or another, the same can be said for ethnicity and sometimes religion.  SURPRISE!!! …… NOT.
For those unfamiliar, fraternity is usually understood to mean a social organization composed only of men, and sorority one of women, although many women's organizations also refer to themselves as fraternities.

By now the infamous video of the members of SAE repeating a pretty offensive chant has pretty much been run in all of the news outlets.  ""Journalists"" who know better and some who are intimately acquainted with Greek life on campus seem to be gleeful because the video supports the ""privileged white boy bad"" meme that they push …. In other words, it works for them.  The Daily Beast states ""Certainly, fraternities seem to be cesspools of racism and misogyny in many cases on many campuses…""    and of course everything can be related to Ferguson,  the location of a viral lie about a teenager with his hands in the air and the racist white cops who they depict as having nothing more to do but set dogs on innocent Black boys while shooting at them.  As the Daily Beast goes on to say ""Ferguson and the University of Oklahoma fraternity may seem like aberrant or spontaneous weeds. But they grow, quite deliberately and predictably, from the same rotten soil of American racial bias.""

So…… what was the chant?  ""There will never be a n****r SAE . You can hang him from a tree, but he will never sign with me. There will never be a n****r SAE.""

Pretty offensive….  Yeah… very.  But it is not an isolated situation.  To one degree or another the fraternity and sororities on America's campuses are divided……Four University of Alabama sororities denied membership to two black women due to interference by advisers or alumnae. One of the women was a prime candidate, the report said – high grades, impressive public service record and familial connections to the university – and despite her success in wooing the potential future Alpha Gamma Delta housemates, alumnae told current members that her membership status would not be put to a vote per usual procedure, the Crimson White wrote. The first black Alabama student to pledge a traditionally white Panhellenic sorority did so in 2003 – and no one has followed suit since.

Since the first Greek-letter society was formed in 1776 at the College of William and Mary, sororities and fraternities have played a vibrant part of campus life. Students who choose to become part of a social fraternities and sororities organization will have the opportunity to be part of a well-rounded, co-curricular experience.

There are 11 African-American or Black sororities with the top three recognized as ""Delta"", AKA and Zeta.  Conversely, there are 18 incorporated African-American or Black fraternities with the top three recognized by their ""short names"" as ""Kappa's"", ""Alpha's"", ""Q's"" or ""Omegas, ""Sigma's"" and ""Iota's"". The organizations include members such as Congressman John Lewis, a member of Phi Beta Sigma, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a member of Alpha Phi Alpha and Sigma Pi Phi;Bobby Rush, a member of Iota Phi Theta; Jesse Jackson, a member of Omega Psi Phi; and Wilt Chamberlain, a member of Kappa Alpha Psi. Some organizations, such as the Prince Hall Masons, Swing Phi Swing and Groove Phi Groove don't use Greek letters solely. The first and oldest successful African-American collegiate fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, was formally established as a fraternity at Cornell University in 1906, though it operated as a social study club in 1905. Precursors to Alpha Phi Alpha included Sigma Pi Phi (a non-collegiate fraternity), and unsuccessful attempts such as Gamma Phi Fraternity at Wilberforce University (first campus recognition documented in 1923; a 1923 yearbook entry reported operation as early as 1905), Alpha Kappa Nu at Indiana University (formation attempted in 1903, but involved too few registrants to assure continuing organization), and Pi Gamma Omicron at Ohio State University (formation originally reported in the Chicago Defender in 1905; but organization failed to receive school recognition). Through 1920, the eight organizations who made up the National Pan-Hellenic Council until 1996 would be formed. In 1996 Iota Phi Theta was invited into the National Pan-Hellenic Council, which then created the ""Divine 9"". Black fraternities and sororities were based on existing fraternities and sororities but cultural additions were made including calls, open hand signs, and step shows; though social in nature, many African-American fraternal organizations were formed with an emphasis on public service and civil rights.Wikipedia

Delta Epsilon Psi is a South Asian interest social and service fraternity located in the United States. Delta Epsilon Psi Fraternity, Inc. was founded on October 1, 1998 at the University of Texas at Austin. The 18 founders formed the fraternity to provide a unified South Asian voice at the school.   Since then, Delta Epsilon Psi has grown to be the largest South Asian interest fraternity in the nation. Other  Asian fraternities are Iota Nu Delta, Beta Chi Theta, Beta Kappa Gamma, Pi Alpha Phi, and  Pi Delta Psi.  alpha Kappa Delta Phi is an Asian sorority, as is Delta Chi Lambda and Delta Kappa Delta… to name just three.

There are several Jewish ""Greek"" sororities and fraternities, Mu Alpha Phi is Puerto Rican.  Some are religious, some are centered around a particular vein of study such as Engineering or Medicine.  Gamma Rho Lambda is is a social, college-based, sorority for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and allied women. It has 15 active chapters and 1 colony across the United States.  And Sigma Omega Phi for the ""Aggressive"" lesbian"".

You get the picture, there are so MANY divisions, so many fraternities and sororities.  Bottom line, just about every major University will have fraternities and sororities, just about all of the will from one time to another be ""politically incorrect"" to ""downright vulgar"".  There has been an attempt at doing away with ""hazing"" which for those unfamiliar with the term is a very extreme form of initiation.  Some of the fraternities have been known to brand their members with hot irons in the formation of their Greek letters, I know of a sorority that lost three potential members to the ocean when they had a mock baptism at a beach, at night with the girls blindfolded.  They were washed out into the Pacific Ocean because the three of them did not know how to swim and became disoriented.  

So, things get out of hand sometimes when young people get together.  The point here is that we don't condone the behavior, however, I am in agreement with the Black Student leader at Oklahoma where the incident took place.  It could have been a ""teachable moment"".  The young men involved are still in their teens and could have been reprimanded, but instead the approach was to banish both the young men and the organization.  Nothing gets solved.  You have to realize that this behavior is learned.  And similar to the Alabama sorority example, their driving force may be the alumni or the elders in control.  For example, one of the sororities at Alabama stated that their alumni would pull funding if they allowed ANY non-white girls into the organization.  

So, as is the fashion to attack one group or another as ""unusual"" is quite disengenuous.  The unfortunate turn of events, howeve, is that instead of reporting the news the outlets find themselves in the position of attacking one group and avoiding the bigger picture.  The theme now is that the only fraternities are filled with racist white males chomping at the bit to rape, pilage and plunder women and minorities......  Now we know that is not true.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/807864019294391/?type=3,2015-03-13 12:20:39,18,1,13,18,0,0,0,0,0

Justice Head's Reckless Talk/Actions Leaves Two Innocent Officers Ambushed.....

Two police officers were shot and wounded during a protest rally in Ferguson, Missouri, early on Thursday, hours after the city's police chief resigned in the wake of a scathing U.S. Justice Department report finding his force was rife with racial bias.

A 41-year-old officer from the St. Louis County Police was struck in the shoulder and a 32-year-old officer from the nearby Webster Groves Police Department was hit in the face.

These two police officers were not residents of nor were they employed by the Ferguson Police Department .....  they were simply helping out

.These police officers were standing there and they were shot, just because they were police officers,"" St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters early on Thursday. 

""I have said all along that we cannot sustain this forever without problems,"" he said, referring to festering tensions in the city since Brown's death last summer.

Ferguson has become an emblem of the tensions between minorities and police departments nationwide since Darren Wilson, a white officer, shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, last summer.

From the actual report:

""Although there are several individuals who have stated that Brown held his hands up in an unambiguous sign of surrender prior to Wilson shooting him dead, their accounts do not
support a prosecution of Wilson. As detailed throughout this report, some of those accounts are inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence; some of those
accounts are materially inconsistent with that witness's own prior statements with no explanation, credible for otherwise, as to why those accounts changed over time. Certain other witnesses who originally stated Brown had his hands up in surrender recanted their original accounts, admitting that they did not witness the shooting or parts of it, despite what they initially reported either to federal or local law enforcement or to the media. Prosecutors did not rely on those accounts when making a prospective decision.""

In other words, all of those hands waved in the air on the congressional floor; all of those hands waved in the air on television; all of the tee-shirts sold with the hands in the air; all of the intrusions in malls and on the streets blocking traffic with people waving their hands in the air; the massacre of two cops sitting in a car; the destruction of livelihood, business and property; the fear instilled in law abiding citizens of Ferguson MO and other depressed neighborhoods regarding their wanting to cooperate with police in order to make their environs livable.

All of it..... based upon a lie promulgated by the chief rabblerousing agitator by the name of Al Sharpton and enforced by the chief legal authority and leaders in the nation.  But why blame good ole Al, this is what he does, he shows up, fleeces money and leaves the town in shambles.  Remember Brawley and the several highlights of his debacles in Brooklyn.  

No one even remembers the government leaders dispatched to attend the state funeral given in honor of a thug who would have committed murder of a policeman if he did not lose his own life.  Two of his fellow ""brothers"" are now in the hospital and much more psychological damage has been wrought on this community and many others......  

So then in the wee hours of the morning:  

""During a protest early Thursday morning in Ferguson, Missouri, shots were fired and two police officers were seriously injured. A live-stream video being shot from across the street by one of the protesters captured the moment.
 
As the first shot rang out a woman near the camera screamed in surprise (at 0:27 in the video). Then after one or two more shots, a man, presumably one of the officers who was hit, could be heard moaning as if in pain. Protesters began to run away from the scene of the violence, and when the camera turns back to police they can be seen swarming, apparently trying to help the injured officers.
 
Seconds later, in what can only be described as a surreal moment, someone on the protesters' side of the street taunts the police in a loud voice saying, ""Acknowledgement nine months ago would have kept that from happening."" (0:48) The protester, whose face isn't seen, was apparently referring to the shooting of Michael Brown, which took place last August"".

428053320608798_806619456085514,"Good Wednesday Afternoon!

The Technical Problem with Hillary's Technology.

Yesterday, I listened to Hillary Clinton's explanation about her usage of the private email service.  While plausible to the ear, especially if you have no knowledge of history or technology --- emails and cell-phones, it was blatantly untrue and if this speech was prepared by the young people who work for her.... well there is no love there.

Let me explain.....  First:  The calculated ""I am just an old grandma so therefore I don't understand that you can receive more than one email source on your phone""  ---- this was about as sill as you can get.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CARRY TWO PHONES to receive email from two different sources.  Some of us have more than two email sources, that would mean that I have a purse full of phones.  

Clinton told an event in California's Silicon Valley last month that she has an iPad, an iPad Mini, an iPhone and a BlackBerry. ""I'm like two steps short of a hoarder,"" she said. She suggested she started out in Washington with a BlackBerry but her devices grew in number.   My question is ""why?"".  Further, why would she still carry the BlackBerry?  

Second:  She stated regarding the server in her basement, that ""It had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches."" 

Seems plausible, if the manner in which the computer system operated is one in which she wrote down or typed up multiple reams of paper and expected the Secret Service to haul the bountiful paper communications around in wheel-barrows.  Cyber-space is ""invisible"" and no matter how many Secret Service officers stood by the door, they would not be able to catch breaches over the internet.

Third:  Since this was apparently the system she used for the majority of her business, I did not understand how this was possible since she was Secretary of State that she would say ""I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material."" 

Where did she email the classified material from since she did not use her .gov email AND a huge portion of her job would be handling classified material... by definition... that is.

Finally... she said she is not handing them over because of personal details such as her daughter's wedding dress and yoga classes.......  and emails to her husband who then stated that he has only sent out two emails in his life.

So.... she said the is through with it .... and that's that..... she is not turning over the server because of the dress and yoga and she has decided that the matter is closed......  she has already turned over 50K worth of communications..  So now .... we should trust her.

All of this would seem pretty preposterous, however, as a ""person on the ground"", with all of the bumper tickers declaring ""Ready for Hillary"", will this make any difference to the crowd that will:

a.  Just want a woman as president.

b.  Take issue to the badgering of ""grandma"".

c.  Only look at having ""the first......"" and have already made up their minds...

Maybe, it will matter or maybe it won't..... what do you think?",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/806619192752207/?type=3,2015-03-11 11:29:19,34,16,26,34,0,0,0,0,0

An End to the Pen and Phone Tyranny?

Tuesday morning the Daily News suddenly decided it was okay to question patriotism!  The Daily News, piece of rag that is is and has always been --- the one you hide in the Wall Street Journal when you want salacious gossip with the writing style and vocabulary fit for a third grader  ( no offense to third-graders).

Daily News columnist Mike Lupica blasted Giuliani as a ""loud political has-been."" Reporters Erin Durkin and Eli Rosenberg accused Giuliani of ""McCarthy-esque rants.""  

Typical insults..... they will be calling them ""idiots"" or using the ""f"" word before ""idiot"", or any other word.  Really who cares?

But in an effort to make sure that the dear leader and the botoxed one --- John Kerry does not botch up yet another foreign policy foray, 47 Republican Senators, including decorated war veteran  Tom Cotton used THEIR pen (they each have one also) to sign the following open letter:

""It has come to our attention while observing your nuclear negotiations with our government that you may not fully understand our constitutional system.  Thus, we are writing to bring to your attention two features of our Constitution—the power to make binding international agreements and the different character of federal offices—which you should seriously consider as negotiations progress.
  
First, under our Constitution, while the president negotiates international agreements, Congress plays the significant role of ratifying them.  In the case of a treaty, the Senate must ratify it by a two-thirds vote.  A so-called congressional-executive agreement requires a majority vote in both the House and the Senate (which, because of procedural rules, effectively means a three-fifths vote in the Senate).  Anything not approved by Congress is a mere executive agreement.
  
Second, the offices of our Constitution have different characteristics.  For example, the president may serve only two 4-year terms, whereas senators may serve an unlimited number of 6-year terms.  As applied today, for instance, President Obama will leave office in January 2017, while most of us will remain in office well beyond then—perhaps decades.
  
What these two constitutional provisions mean is that we will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei.  The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.
  
We hope this letter enriches your knowledge of our constitutional system and promotes mutual understanding and clarity as nuclear negotiations progress.""

The Big Scavenger Hunt on the Way to the Mystery Date.

As a young officer's wife, I was encouraged to join the Officer's Wive's Club.  I went to one meeting and was unable to attend any other until Allen made Battalion Command because I was completing a Ph.D., working as a lecturer at the University and was also a Research  Fellow at the International Trade Institute.  The latter involved travelling oversees to form alliances between the University and foreign countries.  So between those two endeavors and trying to be very ""hands on"" in raising the children......  I had no time.

After Allen took command and we moved to another duty station...... one steeped in a bit more tradition....  I was thrust into the world of the Officer's Wive's club, and various other groups.  While the men did a number of things which entailed preparing for and going overseas, we had the family readiness groups and other such things to busy ourselves with.  Some of them were worthwhile, some tedious and some simply designed to keep us busy and out of the way - these included teas, scavenger hunts, breakfasts, ""executive committee"" meetings, trips to the capital where everyone except me seemed to know all about the unit that their husband commanded and such.  I recall making 7 dozen egg things one evening, baked ziti and trying to find a plaid skirt for the holiday party.

We kept and were kept busy.  BTW this was not that long ago.  Much of it was to allow the guys to get their jobs done...... kept us ""occupied"", made us feel ""just as important"" and most importantly ""kept us out of trouble""..  In other words, mildly useless endeavors.

Sometimes I take a gander at the political wrangling and machinations that we, the common people go through. The vitriol and the party divisions often seem as though they are one big scavenger hunt.  Designed to keep the masses busy while those on the inside work together as one big party to squeeze  what they want out of the system.

Take for example the issue of immigration.  On the left the sales job is one of ""helping"" or ""they arrive here for ""freedom"" or ""they do it for love"" etc......  on the establishment right ""we need the labor""; ""it is good for the economy"" etc.....  different sales job to complete the same outcome ----- open the doors and erase the borders. 

How about common core?  On the one had we need standards and on the other ...same ... we need standards but for different reasons.....  either way, I don't think this dog is going to hunt.

Along the way, you will be thrown off by ""decoys"" that will keep you busy for a second or two..... you might even run down the ""rabbit hole"" once or twice.  Some of the ""decoys"" will be in the form of ""phobia's"" --- there are now 14 of those, others will be cries of racism and ""gender discrimination"" --- each pointing the finger at the other while groping for smelling salts and feigning surprise.  Everyone gets away with as much as they can.......  the Dems are just as content to pay women less and act in self interest as they claim the ""other side"" is.  Its about shaving a buck where you can pull it off undetected.

In other words, the masses are kept busy along this scavenger hunt with sports games, misinformation, yelling,  false cues, sexual ponderance  and other ""rabbits"", watching  speeches that could have been delivered decades ago pin-pointing the same countries -Iran, Russia and Cuba.  And fund-raising astronomical sums of money to run races already fixed.  We run around in circles speaking of countries we likely will never visit while worrying about people we have no clue about.  Wars in the jungles of Africa with people possessing a value system and living in such circumstances that it is preposterous that we would stand around with pictures on Facebook asking for the ""return of our girls"" from primitive tribes without electricity and running water, much less internet and wireless connections for their Twitter.

In this day and age, we are so unserious that we have the spectacle of our silly and over-employed law-makers standing in the hallowed halls of great men and women long gone, flinging up their hands in the air to a fantasy woven by an idle street thug who lost his friend in the act of trying to take an officer's gun.  An incident that even the Justice department said did not happen. But this poppycock is played out at every gathering.  The young man in question is talented --- its a pity he missed his calling, really.  And when they are not doing that, there are wondering whether or not an island will tip over if more people are added to the island such as said recently by a sitting Congressman.

Regardless, we continue on the scavenger hunt, and some of us believers hope that we will once again become serious, because this scavenger hunt has allowed those hard at work to dismantle the constitution complete their tasks unfettered as we follow the rabbits down each and every hole, wondering if Obama is in love with America, if he was born here, if he is smart/dumb, where his big stick is and what church/mosque/ coven he belongs to and how much of our conversation with Millie down the street is he listening to.  It's as if he is our ""Mystery Date"" instead of the President.

See you at the next scavenger hunt.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/805316996215760/?type=3,2015-03-08 21:59:19,17,5,13,17,0,0,0,0,0

HBO is finishing up a tough documentary on the Church of Scientology.

The Hollywood Reporter says that a ""bombshell"" film on Scientology and its hold on some Hollywood stars will air in 2015.

HBO confirmed only that Oscar winner Alex Gibney (""Taxi to the Dark Side"") is doing the film and HBO plans to run it.

The film is expected to feature new revelations about the controversial church and its famous followers, such as Cruise and John Travolta. If it's finished in time, it will be submitted to the Sundance Film Festival in January.

THR says the film is based on the book, ""Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief,"" by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Lawrence Wright.

No matter what Gibney's film says, no matter how well sourced it is, no matter how respected HBO's documentary unit is, the notoriously litigious Church of Scientology is likely to be peeved

Scientology is a body of beliefs and related practices created by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard (1911–1986), beginning in 1952 as a successor to his earlier self-help system, Dianetics. Hubbard characterized Scientology as a religion, and in 1953 he incorporated the Church of Scientology in Camden, New Jersey.

Fundamental to Scientology is a view of Man as a spiritual being. In Scientology, the spiritual being is called the thetan. The term is taken from the Greek letter theta for ""thought"" or ""life"" or ""the spirit."" It is used to avoid confusion with previous concepts of the soul. The thetan is immortal and has lived—and will continue to live—through countless lifetimes. One is a thetan who has a mind and who occupies a body. The thetan animates the body and uses the mind.

Also fundamental to Scientology is a view of life as compartmentalized into urges (drives, impulses) toward survival. These are called the dynamics and number eight in all.

The First Dynamic—is the urge toward existence as one's self. Here we have individuality expressed fully. This can be called the Self Dynamic.

The Second Dynamic—is the urge toward existence as a sexual activity. This dynamic actually has two divisions. Second Dynamic (a) is the sexual act itself. And the Second Dynamic (b) is the family unit, including the rearing of children. This can be called the Sex Dynamic.

The Third Dynamic—is the urge toward existence in groups of individuals. Any group, or part of an entire class, could be considered to be a part of the Third Dynamic. The school, the society, the town, the nation are each part of the Third Dynamic and each one is a Third Dynamic. This can be called the Group Dynamic.

The Fourth Dynamic—is the urge toward existence as or of Mankind. Whereas one race would be considered a Third Dynamic, all the races would be considered the Fourth Dynamic. This can be called the Mankind Dynamic.

The Fifth Dynamic—is the urge toward existence of the animal kingdom. This includes all living things, whether vegetable or animal, the fish in the sea, the beasts of the field or of the forest, grass, trees, flowers or anything directly and intimately motivated by life. This can be called the Animal Dynamic.

The Sixth Dynamic—is the urge toward existence as the physical universe. The physical universe is composed of Matter, Energy, Space and Time. In Scientology we take the first letter of each of these words and coin a word—MEST. This can be called the Universe Dynamic.

The Seventh Dynamic—is the urge toward existence as or of spirits. Anything spiritual, with or without identity, would come under the heading of the Seventh Dynamic. This can be called the Spiritual Dynamic.

The Eighth Dynamic—is the urge toward existence as infinity. This is also identified as the Supreme Being. This is called the Eighth Dynamic because the symbol of infinity, ∞, stood upright makes the numeral 8. This can be called the Infinity or God Dynamic.

Scientologists usually call these by number.  Remember....... Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard was a science fiction writer with personal emotional and psychosis problems.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/805105199570273/?type=3,2015-03-08 12:10:53,11,3,3,11,0,0,0,0,0

Guns and Foster Kids in Nevada.

In the United States there are more than 100,000 children and youth are in need of permanent adoptive families.  For reasons such as abuse, neglect, and abandonment, their birth families are unwilling or unable to provide for the needs of these kids.  Once the court has determined they cannot safely live with birth family, the search begins for a family willing to adopt.  Unfortunately for many kids, the waiting time for that family can be months or even years.

Specifically, in Nevada there are more than 5000 children in the foster care system.  Because of their history, children in foster care are more likely than other children to exhibit high levels of behavioral and emotional problems. They are also more likely to be suspended or expelled from school, and to exhibit low levels of school engagement and involvement with extracurricular activities. Children in foster care are also more likely to have received mental health services in the past year, to have a limiting physical, learning, or mental health condition, or to be in poor or fair health. One study found that almost 60 percent of young children (ages 2 months to two years) in foster care were at a high risk for a developmental delay or neurological impairment - See more at: http://www.childtrends.org/?indicators=foster-care#sthash.e7OWXcxH.dpuf

Youth who ""age out"" of foster care (instead of returning home or being adopted) may face challenges to making a successful transition to adulthood. According to the only national study of youth aging out of foster care, 38 percent had emotional problems, 50 percent had used illegal drugs, and 25 percent were involved with the legal system. Preparation for further education and career was also a problem for these young people. Only 48 percent of foster youth who had ""aged out"" of the system had graduated from high school at the time of discharge, and only 54 percent had graduated from high school two to four years after discharge. As adults, children who spent long periods of time in multiple foster care homes were more likely than other children to encounter problems such as unemployment, homelessness, and incarceration, as well as to experience early pregnancy. - See more at: http://www.childtrends.org/?indicators=foster-care#sthash.e7OWXcxH.dpuf

Given all of these fact's the reality of the foster care system is that it is still run by a specific ideology and guess who pays:  the kids.  Take this situation for example:

A Nevada couple who can't foster children because they legally own firearms are asking state officials to change the law.

Brian and Valerie Wilson, of Las Vegas, told ""Fox & Friends"" Sunday that they have always planned to become foster parents and eventually adopt, but have been denied permission to do so because of a state regulation that prohibits the carrying of loaded weapons with foster children.

Assembly Bill 167 would allow foster parents with concealed-carry permits to have loaded firearms on their bodies, in their vehicles or in their homes.

""I don't know if some of my peers have toured Child Haven or have been in Child Haven, but we have children in need of great foster care, and we have had people that are law-abiding citizens that have gotten their background checks, that have their CCWs, literally denied to foster a child because they have a concealed-weapons permit,"" Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, R-Las Vegas, said.

So far, there's no sign that gay adoption supporters who insist ""all children deserve a loving home"" are rushing to help the Wilsons.

In the United States, foster home licensing requirements vary from state to state, but are generally overseen by each state's Department of Child Protective Services or Human Services. In some states, counties have this responsibility.

Georgia O'Keefe dies

Georgia O'Keefe, the artist who gained worldwide fame for her austere minimalist paintings of the American southwest, dies in Santa Fe at the age of 98.
 
Born in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, in 1887, O'Keefe grew up in Virginia and first studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. Initially, she embraced a highly abstracted, urban style of art. She later moved to New York where she thrived within the growing community of abstract expressionists. Beginning in 1912, though, she began spending time in Texas and she became the head of the art department at the West Texas State Normal College in 1916. O'Keefe's time in Texas sparked her enduring fascination with the stark and powerful western landscape. She began to paint more representational images that drew on the natural forms of the canyons and plains that surrounded her. O'Keefe's paintings of cow skulls and calla lilies gained particular attention and won her an enthusiastic audience.
 
Her marriage to the New York art dealer and photographer Alfred Stieglitz brought O'Keefe back to the northeast. For a decade, she divided her time between New York City and the couple's home in Lake George, New York. In 1919, O'Keefe made a brief visit to the small New Mexican village of Taos, and she returned for a longer stay in 1929. Attracted to the clear desert light and snow-capped mountains, she began returning to New Mexico every summer to paint. O'Keefe found a vibrant and supportive community among the artists that had been flocking to Taos and Santa Fe since the 1890s.
 
After Stieglitz died in 1949, O'Keefe permanently relocated to Abiquiu, New Mexico. There she continued to produce her hauntingly simple images of the southwestern land she loved. By the time she died in 1986, O'Keefe was considered one of the preeminent artists of the American West and had inspired legions of imitators.

Should we ever ....""go there"" ?

I keep hearing it from conservatives ---- we should never ""go there.....  Go where?  Well.......  social issues......   We should just stick to the economy and the pipeline.....  money stuff or something like that.

But.....  wait a minute.  Sure the economy is important.  Sure, the pipeline should have been constructed ....  sure there are other abstract and non personal things we can involve ourselves with but have you ever heard three people sitting together socially, discussing the economy, small government and the pipeline on a Friday evening?

Well.... no.  Instead, they engage in gossip, Kim Kardashian, sports, music, and when the topic of the Republicans come up....... idea might be how they always ""care just about money"".  Even though we feel so boxed in that we can not discuss anything more than the economy, small government and the pipeline --- thus, by being safe.... we feed into the stereotype.  

But truly can you blame the Republican politician for shying away from the economy, small government and the pipeline?  Well.... no.....  in this attack dog atmosphere, if you tend to be a phlegmatic temperament ( I am not) ..... you will demure from offending, you might speak your mind but when the going gets ""hot"" you then apologize for saying what you said, for even thinking what you thought and and promise never to do either again although talking, thinking and pondering are three of your God given rights.  

Take for example the brilliant, highly admired and  well esteemed Dr. Ben Carson.  I want to tell you that I have met this man and been fortunate enough to be in the company of he and  his family on several occasions. I learn something new and useful every time.  The incident that I am speaking of was his discussion with a reporter regarding the origins of homosexuality.    He (Ben Carson) stated that he felt it was a choice rather than an innate characteristic.  

OK.  That is not the popular vein of thought and whether or not he is right or he is wrong...... He is entitled to voice his opinion without MUCH, MUCH, MUCH lower intellects, political hacks and ""writers"" with cheap bachelor's degrees on ""journalism""  or ""gobbledygook"" filled bio's where they remember everything right down to the time they changed the toilet paper in an outhouse in Guatemala for an orphan with a runny nose ..... refer to him as ""stupid"". 

He is a pediatric neurosurgeon, quite accomplished and if a child of ther's needed help...... I doubt if they would turn to their fellow ""journalism""  buddies for advice..... well maybe not.

I read a number of the acidic articles by some of his critics today.  One from the Atlantic even posted a nanny boo boo by getting someone with more degrees.....  How childish can one M.D. get about another.  

""Sexual orientation"" is the preferred term used when referring to an individual's physical and/or emotional attraction to the same and/or opposite gender. ""Gay,"" ""lesbian,"" ""bisexual"" and ""straight"" are all examples of sexual orientations. A person's sexual orientation is distinct from a person's gender identity and expression.

""Whether sexual orientation is a trait we are born with (nature) or is caused by the environment we are raised in (nurture) has been debated by scientists, religious leaders, elected officials, and the general public. 

Proponents argue that sexual orientation, much like handedness or tongue curling, is determined by natural, immutable biological factors such as genes or hormones, and therefore gay people should be entitled to the same legal rights and protections as other human beings.

Opponents argue that homosexuality is a reversible and unfortunate lifestyle choice resulting from poor child-parent relationships, sexual abuse, brainwashing by pro-gay influences, or other developmental causes. Some contend that gay people should be denied marriage, discrimination protection, and social and religious acceptance.""

http://borngay.procon.org/

Where does this get confused?

The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary, in its 2002 edition, provided definitions for ""sexual preference"" and ""sexual orientation"":

Sexual preference: ""The preference one shows by having a sexual interest in members of the same, opposite, or either sex.""

Sexual orientation: ""The direction of one's sexual interest toward members of the same, opposite, or both sexes, especially a direction seen to be dictated by physiologic rather than sociologic forces. Replaces sexual preference in most contemporary uses.""

Perhaps, in the discussion, the ""preference and orientation"" differentiation were not emphasized because it IS possible that after prolonged activity a person might develop a ""preference"" for one direction over another.  

I both know and ""know of"" homosexual men who have made a conscious decision to marry and have children.  Only one that I know of returned to his former life... although I don't make it a habit of questioning my friends on how they are doing in this area of their lives.  I also have a friend who simply likes the companionship of another woman and they have been together for some time.  The relationship with her former husband is intact but her preference is the person she is with.  AND I have friends who are who they are - homosexual and have never had any doubt about that fact.,

In other words, every journey is different and it is complicated.... even more so conflicted  with the breakdown of culture, families, decency and respect for fellow human beings.  

Allen and I have never pried into the lives of our friends and associates, if we like someone.... we like them and they become friends.  In our society, everyone seems to have a ""beef""  and some seem to have a ""black hole"" that could not be filled with one million gallons of liquid.  Their lives are a series of ""trip wires"" waiting to go off at the slightest provocation.  

This is where the politics of division come in.

The politics of division feeds upon the soft underbelly of resentment, be it the bully that took our lunch in the fourth grade, the invitation to the ""sleep-over"" that you were left out of in the seventh grade, the boy who did not like you in the 9th grade, the girl who used you in the 10th; or the father who ignored you because you were not ""manly"" enough and made you feel ashamed; or the petite mother who felt you were ""too big"" ......  These ""beefs"" can stem from the remembrance of sexual, racial or gender discrimination.  Allen's aunt told me about an incident that happened in south Georgia many years ago.  Allen's mother and her sister ""Mary"" were sitting on the porch eating ice cream after church.  A caucasian man  and his sons  riding in a car told them they might be ""comely"" if they were not so dark.  How low and how cruel it must have felt NOT to be able to say anything back.  But then again, I remember my uncle George who came to America and within 10 years he owned 4 gas stations in Newark, New Jersey.  On one occasion while he was visiting,  our little dog ran into a yard across the street from our house.  The woman, who later tearfully apologized, called the police.  He (my uncle) was arrested and spent the night in jail for suspicion of armed robbery. He never owned a gun.  He was just armed with his ""blackness"".  Through forgiveness we all became fast friends.

I say all of this to emphasize the fact that ""beefs"" are part of the social pattern of our society, we are different so we have conflicts which become ""beefs"" if we let it.  The social issues are what make us ""real people"", We, as conservatives,  can not avoid them.....even if the world be against us or the manner in which we think.  An intelligent man or woman can grow.  An intolerant society regardless of the political leaning is both dangerous and doomed to end in conflict.  One man will not dominate or be in the yoke of  another ......  at least not for long.

So....  Should we (as conservatives)  ever ....""go there"" ?  Yep, say what we mean and mean what we say.....  then we can move beyond.  It OK to learn, we can not forgive ourselves when we are cowards.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/803874093026717/?type=3,2015-03-05 23:30:09,32,6,60,32,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_803821866365273,"Today in History:  1966, Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler hits #1 with ""Ballad Of The Green Berets""

Barry Allen Sadler (November 1, 1940 – November 5, 1989) was an American military veteran, author, actor, and singer-songwriter. Sadler served as a Green Beret combat medic with the rank of Staff Sergeant of the United States Army during the Vietnam War. Most of his work has a military theme, and he credited himself as SSG Barry Sadler, although his music credits read SSgt Barry Sadler. He is most famously known for his hit song ""Ballad of the Green Berets.""

He had a colorful life, In his early years, his family relocated often. His parents divorced when Sadler was very young, and his father died not long after of a rare form of nervous system cancer at the age of 36. His mother took her sons with her as she worked at temporary jobs in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.

Sadler dropped out of high school during the tenth grade in Leadville, Colorado. After a year of hitch-hiking across the country, he enlisted at age 17 in the U.S. Air Force. He was trained as a radar technician and was stationed in Japan. Following his discharge, Sadler enlisted with the Army, seeking more excitement.

After completing airborne training, Sadler volunteered for the U.S. Army Special Forces and passed the difficult selection tests. Following lengthy training as a combat medic at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, he was sent to South Vietnam. During May 1965, while on a combat patrol in the Central Highlands southeast of Pleiku, he was severely wounded in the knee by a feces-covered punji stick. He was already taking an antibiotic for dysentery, and no ill effects from the punji stick were seen. He used a cotton swab and an adhesive bandage, then finished the patrol. However, he developed a serious infection in his leg, and was flown to Walter Reed Hospital in the United States. Sadler's doctors were forced to surgically enlarge the wound to drain it and to administer penicillin. While he was recuperating, he heard Senator Robert F. Kennedy dedicate the new JFK Center for Special Warfare at Fort Bragg. Sadler promised himself that if he successfully recovered from the infection, he would give away the rights to a song he was then helping to write, ""The Ballad of the Green Berets."" He recovered completely and kept his promise.

Sadler recorded his now-famous song, ""The Ballad of the Green Berets"", a patriotic song. The recording was encouraged by writer Robin Moore, author of the novel The Green Berets. The book became a 1968 movie, The Green Berets, featuring John Wayne, with ""The Ballad of the Green Berets"" arranged as a choral version by Ken Darby as the title song of the movie. Moore wrote an introduction to Sadler's autobiography, I'm A Lucky One, which he dictated to Tom Mahoney and which Macmillan Co. published during 1967. The song ""The Ballad of the Green Berets"" was vended by the RCA Victor Records company first during early 1966 and became a fast-selling single, scoring No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five consecutive weeks from March 5 to April 2, 1966. It sold more than a million copies.

According to the ribbons and badges worn by Sadler in a televised performance of ""The Ballad of the Green Berets,"" he received the following awards for his military service: Purple Heart Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Air Force Longevity Service Award, Combat Infantryman Badge, Parachutist Badge, and the South Vietnamese Parachutist Badge.

The ribbons shown in Sadler's television performance mentioned above did not represent all of Sadler's awards. Sadler was also entitled to the National Defense Service Medal and the Vietnam Campaign Medal. He had the option of replacing the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal with the Vietnam Service Medal.

.Sadler was unable to score another major success, though his ""The A-Team "" was a Top 30 Billboard chart single during 1966. Sadler began writing novels. He chose to write about soldiers. His popular Casca series concerns the title character, Casca Rufio Longinius (a sort of combination of Saint Longinus and The Wandering Jew), the Roman soldier who stabbed Christ during the crucifixion, and is thus cursed to remain a soldier until the Second Coming. The novels feature Casca to the 20th century. Sadler himself wrote only the first few books, the remainder being assigned by the publishers to uncredited writers though issued with his name. Subsequent books have been written by different authors.

On December 1, 1978, at about 11:00 p.m., Sadler killed a country music songwriter named Lee Emerson Bellamy with one gunshot to the head.[4] The shooting was the culmination of a month-long dispute the men had concerning Darlene Sharp, who was Bellamy's former girlfriend, and Sadler's lover at the time. Bellamy was not pleased by her involvement with Sadler. Witnesses gave testimony that prior to the shooting, Bellamy made many harassing telephone calls to Sadler, and numerous threats on his life.

On June 1, 1979, Sadler was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the death of Lee Emerson Bellamy, and sentenced to 4–5 years in prison. Upon appeal, due to the circumstances of the case, his sentence was reduced to only 21 days. Sadler was later sued for wrongful death by Bellamy's estate, and was ordered to pay restitution of about $10,000.

adler relocated to Guatemala City during the mid 1980s and frequented a restaurant named La Europa (also known as Freddie's Bar, after the German proprietor). He continued to publish the Casca books (mostly using various ghostwriters), produced a self-defense video (which was never released) and even helped with vaccination programs in rural villages.

On September 7, 1988 in Guatemala City, Sadler was shot in the head at night in a taxicab by someone pursuing a robbery attempt. He was airlifted back to the United States by friends from the magazine Soldier Of Fortune, where he was hospitalized and remained in a coma for several months. He was released eventually, but with significant brain damage. When released from the hospital during January 1989, he was reported missing by his family and was eventually found.He died on November 5, 1989 at his mother's home in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, of complications from his gunshot injury, just four days after his 49th birthday. He was survived by his wife, Lavona Sadler, daughter Brooke Sadler, and sons Thor Sadler and Baron Sadler.

A U.S.  Justice Department probe found systemic racial bias and unconstitutional policing that targeted blacks in Ferguson, Missouri, but cleared a white officer there in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in August.

Why?

The report said police in the St. Louis suburb issued almost all of its traffic citations to blacks as it tried to raise revenue through fines and court fees. 

Police also targeted blacks for arrests, many on dubious grounds, and spread racist jokes through emails, said the report that was compiled after Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was unarmed.

The report will most likely force Ferguson officials to either negotiate a settlement with the Justice Department or face being sued by it on charges of violating the Constitution. Under Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., the Justice Department has opened more than 20 such investigations into local police departments and issued tough findings against cities including Newark; Albuquerque, N.M.; and Cleveland.

Ferguson, a city with a decimated by riots and mayhem, will now be sued.  For Mr. Holder, the case has been deeply personal. He spoke about conversations he had as a boy with his father about what to do when stopped by the police. And he described his own experience as the victim of racial profiling.

Its personal, tell that to the people of Ferguson who want jobs or just milk and bread.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/803071856440274/?type=3,2015-03-04 15:50:48,9,1,2,9,0,0,0,0,0

But but but Colin did it and Jason did it........  No buts  honey... you want to be President!

I started to giggle this morning as the morning news showed Hillary Clinton looking like a grandmother on tour through buidings in Washington.  All of those kindly, colorful and figure skimming  polyester pant's suits and the too longish hair and small oxfords contrasting with the words that she was running her emails through her own private server in the basement of her sweet cottage in upstate New York.  

How much more ""Ma Barker"" can you get than that?  

But how could she know?  No one told her....... well, yes they did.  State Department technology experts expressed security concerns that then–Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was using a private email service rather than the government's fortified and monitored system, but those fears fell on deaf ears, a current employee on the department's cybersecurity team told Al Jazeera America on Tuesday.
 
The employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job or more... much more...., said it was well known that Clinton's emails were at greater risk of being hacked, intercepted or monitored, but the warnings were ignored.

The revelations have set off a firestorm for the potential 2016 presidential candidate among open-records advocates who question whether Clinton took this approach to circumvent the normal archiving process for a position of that level. But cybersecurity experts were equally galled by the myriad ways the emails of the nation's top diplomat could have been compromised.

Mad....about what?


The owner of Treetops in Gaylord now says the price tag between clean-up, legal fees, and out-of-pocket expenses is around $430,000. 

Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity is allegedly responsible for major damage to an entire wing at the resort. Last week, U of M announced the fraternity will be banned from campus for four years. The sorority involved, Sigma Delta Tau, has been suspended for two years.

Other fraternities and sororities did about $30,000 of damage at Boyne Highlands in Harbor Springs the same weekend.

What's up with this?

A ski resort has issued the University of Michigan with a bill for half a million dollars after six fraternities and sororities staged a huge party that tore apart the hotel in an Animal House-style melee.
 
Originally, it was estimated the college students caused around $75,000 damage at Treetops Resort during a ski trip in January. 
 
But a full assessment of the 45 rooms and connecting hallway - which was stripped of its ceiling - plus the loss of revenue, and damage to the brand's reputation has seen that figure multiply by six.
 
And according to Barry Owens, general manager of Treetops in Gaylord, the fraternity that originally apologized for the damage - Sigma Alpha Mu - is refusing to pay up.

An Oklahoma City homeless veteran who died Thursday after being diagnosed with cancer is being buried in Marine dress blues to honor his dying wish.

KOCO-TV said Donnie Loneman loved being a Marine and made his final request after he was told he had three weeks to live.

Loneman, a Native American, spent a decade living on the streets and neither owned a dress uniform nor could he afford one.

The station reported that the Oklahoma City Veteran's Affairs Medical Center and several veterans organization came together to assist Loneman in his last days.

They secured a donated dress uniform and kicked in to pay his funeral expenses, and to provide him with an honor guard detail for the burial.

KOCO's report shows Loneman on his death bed at the VA hospital tucked under a Marine Corps flag.

""He said, 'I'm going to enter the gates [of Heaven], and I'm going to tell all the Marines that are standing there that they're relieved of their duty, and I'm going to take their place, and I'll stand there until my arms get tired, and another Marine comes."" He said, 'I'm ready to go,'"" said Christine Cleary, who worked with Loneman at the VA's homeless program.

428053320608798_801541103260016,"Good Sunday Morning!

Observations in Purpose......

Over this past week I have had the pleasure of being in the company of interesting people with a zest for life that gave me a ""shot in the arm"", so to speak, and uplifted my view of the world as well as the desire to expand my horizons.   

The first such person is my sister who arrived from London England to spend a bit of time with me.  The first full day she spent with me we drove to Winter Park, Florida for a luncheon with the local Women's Republican Club. Our first big mistake was relying on Map Quest to direct our way.  A normal 2.5 hour journey became a 3.5 hour trek which included local roads, U-turns and the like.  

In other words, we were late.  However, the majority of the attendees waited for us.  The head of the Republican Executive Committee, Michael Barnett  accompanied me and I hope that we conducted a proper presentation.  I spoke about the current political situation as well as some of the topics that I am more familiar with such immigration, culture and our American Heritage.  Things we ought to take into consideration regarding the next election.  My sister spoke briefly about the ""no-go"" zones and the dangers that Jewish citizens face in Europe.  Believe nothing of what you hear in the news about this,  the truth is scrubbed for both political and economic reasons.    And finally Mike spoke about the local Florida ""going's on"" and the outreach involved.  

We spoke only briefly about the fact that it is African-American history month, placing an emphasis on Americans.  The question and answer session lasted until roughly 3:00 or so.  I think that we were relevant.  

It was not until we got into the car that my sister mentioned something that we (Mike and I ) were somewhat oblivious to........  We are all Black, we did not make a specifically racial presentation and the group we were speaking to were all Caucasian and Republican.  Keep this in mind when the usual suspects will convince you that you are inherently racist because you happen to be ""white"" and you adhere to ""conservative"" values.  The three of us did not entertain, we spoke about relevant things with candor.  

We were first and foremost people relating to people about issues that affect …....   Americans … regardless of race, color or creed.  

The second experience was a Bar Mitzvah.  Yesterday my dear friend's father went through his second Bar Mitzvah at the age of 92.  I looked at her wonderfully close family sit misty eyed and proud as their father said his speech with the clarity of a man half his age.  He spoke about his love of family and friends, his life as a Jew and his dedication to his chosen profession as a surgeon.  This man approached life with a sense of purpose and clarity.  The only time he faltered was when he mentioned the gratitude that he had for his wife, gone just recently, and what a partner she was in their remarkable journey of faith and family.   

Although I did not understand most of the service, as it was done in Hebrew, I sat for the 3 hours feeling privileged to be in their company.  I made a couple of faux pax's  ----- first, I took a couple of pictures and second I crossed myself after a prayer.  Oh well, sometimes you can take the girl out of mass but you can't take the mass out of the girl.....  I apologize if I offended but deeply grateful to be included.  I think I might have been the only Catholic Jamaican present (smile).  I had a wonderful experience.  

So, why bring up any of this on this Sunday morning?  Because over this past 6 years we, as Americans, have been divided and divided and divided again.  Unfortunately it will take many-fold the amount of time it took to ""do the deed"" to ""un-do the deed"".  We take offense at the slightest thing, assuming that if someone hold's the door for us as we approach, or refers to us as ""Miss"" or ""lady"" that they are woman-hating sexists;  assuming that if a person who is white says ""black"", ""Spanish"", or ""Oriental"" that they have GOT to be racist.......  they HAVE GOT to be racist; assuming that if someone mentions that ""allahu akbar"" is yelled during a massacre that the person committing the crime must be Islamic or at least intimately involved with the Islamic faith. …...  they must be ""Islamophobic""   ----- not that it has never  been yelled by an Irish or Jamaican or Jew committing the same dastardly deed.  At least not in recorded history.

We, the little people, never understood that it was for votes......  for control......  We spend time fighting each other.  Even among the same party --- and we get fearful.  So fearful that we begin to set up bunkers, both physically and in our minds to protect ourselves against impending doom.  Let me ask you something..... IF there was an ""Armageddon"" would you like to be the only one alive with your paper money, gold ingots and canned foods living in a hole in the ground?  Fear, mistrust, and isolation are also powerful tools.

So, finally, this was the week of reaching beyond.  I welcome every chance, there is a big America out there...... A big world..... and it ain't all bad..... just different and enlightening.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/801541103260016/?type=3,2015-03-01 09:22:00,32,12,21,32,0,0,0,0,0

It's Election Time in Israel and Guess Who's Interfering?

Political parties in Israel can be categorized into five groups: Right, center, left, ultra-orthodox (""Haredi"") and Arabs. The right consists of Likud, the Jewish Home, and Yisrael Beiteinu. In the center we can find two parties: Yesh Atid and Kulanu. The left parties are the Zionist Camp (a union of Labor and Ha'tnua) and Meretz. In a historic move, the Arab parties decided to unite in the coming election and to run together as one united party. The Haredi (ultra-orthodox) parties also considered the idea of unity briefly but eventually decided to stay as separate parties: United Torah Judaism party (UTJ) for the Ashkenazi Haredis, Shas party for the Sephardic Haredis and Yachad for the hard-right wing Haredis.

President Obama says he won't meet with Benjamin Netanyahu when the Israeli prime minister visits Washington next month because it's too close to Israel's election. That's not stopping former Obama campaign aides and donors from getting involved.

In fact, Israel's election has become a bipartisan, American affair. Campaign strategists for Senate Republicans work as consultants, and money is pouring in from wealthy Democratic and GOP contributors.

That's in addition to what has emerged as the major campaign issue: a long-testy relationship between Netanyahu and Obama that has been revived over Netanyahu's acceptance of a Republican invitation to address Congress two weeks before Israel's vote March 17.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/02/12/israel-election-us-consultants-donors/23237871/

There is no legal ban on foreign campaign consultants.

The Republican consultants and money supporting right-wing causes provide a boost to Netanyahu's Likud Party, while the Democrats back the more liberal Labor Party and the Zionist Camp, a center-left coalition that includes Labor.

In a statement to USA TODAY, Likud confirmed that Republican political strategists Vincent Harris and John McLaughlin have ""advisory roles to complement"" the party's professional team to ""ensure the public is aware of the party's accomplishments and plans for the future.""

A team of President Barack Obama's political operatives arrived in Israel to campaign for the defeat of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the March elections just days after the White House complained about the Israeli leader's plan to address Congress over Iran's nuclear program.

The five Democratic consultants are led by political strategist Jeremy Bird, who was the field director for Obama's key 2008 South Carolina Democratic primary election when he beat Hillary Clinton, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported

Urgent: Rate Obama on His Job Performance. Vote Here Now!

Which way will it go?  

Unofficially, a far greater electoral drama is unfolding. The choice is not between Netanyahu and Herzog/Livni. It is between Netanyahu and US President Barack Obama.

As the White House sees it, if Herzog/Livni form the next government, then Jerusalem will dance to Obama's tune. If Netanyahu is reelected, then the entire edifice of Obama's Middle East policy may topple and fall.

428053320608798_800793643334762,"The Usual Unfortunate End 

Putin: ""I will personally lead the investigation""..

Unfortunate things happen to critics of Putin. It is probably just a coincidence, or a random situation....  I am not a critic.... nor is anyone I know.......nor my relatives....... nor associates...

However.....

The ancestry of Vladimir Putin has been described as a mystery with no records surviving of any ancestors of any people with the surname ""Putin"" beyond his grandfather Spiridon Ivanovich.

 Putin graduated from the International Law branch of the Law Department of the Leningrad State University in 1975, writing his final thesis on international law. His thesis was titled ""The Most Favored Nation Trading Principle in International Law"". While at university he had to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and remained a member until the party was dissolved in December 1991. Also at the University he met Anatoly Sobchak who later played an important role in Putin's career. Anatoly Sobchak was at the time an Assistant Professor and lectured Putin's class on Business Law.

> On February 20, 2000, Sobchak died suddenly in the town of Svetlogorsk of the Kaliningrad Oblast during his trip to support Putin's election, shortly after his meeting with Putin on February 16. The official cause of death was a heart attack, but the findings of two medical experts were contradictory according to journalist Andrei Karaulov. A criminal investigation of Sobchak's death was opened only on May 6, 2000, more than two months later. The Democratic Union party led by Valeria Novodvorskaya made an official statement that not only Sobchak, but also two of his aides had heart attacks simultaneously, 

In this case........ three men drop dead simultaneously from a heart attack.  At the same time...... in the same room.......  Happens all of the time.

After a steady climb through the ranks..... On 25 July 1998, Boris Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin head of the FSB (one of the successor agencies to the KGB), the position Putin occupied until August 1999. He became a permanent member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation on 1 October 1998 and its Secretary on 29 March 1999. Yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor. Still later on that same day, Putin agreed to run for the presidency.

On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and, according to the Constitution of Russia, Putin became Acting President of the Russian Federation. On assuming this role, Putin went on a previously scheduled visit to Russian troops in Chechnya.

The first Presidential Decree that Putin signed, on 31 December 1999, was titled ""On guarantees for former president of the Russian Federation and members of his family"". This ensured that ""corruption charges against the outgoing President Yeltsin and his relatives"" would not be pursued.

I think that was generous..... 

While his opponents had been preparing for an election in June 2000, Yeltsin's resignation resulted in the Presidential elections being held within three months, on 26 March 2000; Putin won in the first round with 53% of the vote.  Quite fortunate.

>On 14 March 2004, Putin was elected to the presidency for a second term, receiving 71% of the vote.  The continued criminal prosecution of Russia's then richest man, President of YUKOS company Mikhail Khodorkovsky, for fraud and tax evasion was seen by the international press as a retaliation for Khodorkovsky's donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the Kremlin. The government said that Khodorkovsky was corrupting a large segment of the Duma to prevent tax code changes such as taxes on windfall profits and closing offshore tax evasion vehicles. Khodorkovsky was arrested, Yukos was bankrupted and the company's assets were auctioned at below-market value, with the largest share acquired by the state company Rosneft.

>Putin was criticized in the West and also by Russian liberals for what many observers considered a wide-scale crackdown on media freedom in Russia. On 7 October 2006, Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist who exposed corruption in the Russian army and its conduct in Chechnya, was shot in the lobby of her apartment building. 

Putin was barred from a third term by the Constitution. First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was elected his successor. In a power-switching operation on 8 May 2008, only a day after handing the presidency to Medvedev, Putin was appointed Prime Minister of Russia, maintaining his political dominance.At the United Russia Congress in Moscow on 24 September 2011, Medvedev officially proposed that Putin stand for the Presidency in 2012, an offer which Putin graciously accepted.

Putin's domestic policies, especially early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a vertical power structure. On 13 May 2000, he issued a decree putting the 89 federal subjects of Russia into seven administrative federal districts and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts 

On 13 May 2000, Putin introduced seven federal districts for administrative purposes. On 19 January 2010, the 8th North Caucasian Federal District (shown here in purple) was split from Southern Federal District. On 21 March 2014, the new 9th Crimean Federal District was formed after the accession of Crimea and Sevastopol to the Russian Federation.
According to Stephen White, Russia under the presidency of Putin made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a ""second edition"" of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions and circumstances.

>During his first term in office, Putin moved to curb the political ambitions of some of the Yeltsin-era oligarchs, resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky; other oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich and Arkady Rotenberg soon joined Putin's camp....... wise idea, if I say so myself.

During Putin's eight years in office, industry grew substantially, as did production, construction, real incomes, credit, and the middle class. Putin has also been praised for eliminating widespread barter and thus boosting the economy. Inflation remained a problem however.

In 2001, Putin obtained approval for a flat tax rate of 13%; the corporate rate of tax was also reduced from 35 percent to 24 percent; Small businesses also get better treatment. The old system, with high tax rates, has been replaced by a new system where companies can choose either a 6-percent tax on gross revenue or a 15-percent tax on profits. The overall tax burden is lower in Russia than in most European countries.

Under Putin as President and Premier, most of the world's largest automotive companies opened plants in Russia, which Putin encouraged via tax incentives, as well as protectionist measures which discouraged imports.

Putin regularly attends the most important services of the Russian Orthodox Church on the main Orthodox Christian holidays.

 While from the early 2000s (decade) Russia started pumping more money into its military and defence industry, it was only in 2008 that the full-scale Russian military reform began, aimed to modernize Russian Armed Forces and made them significantly more effective.

>Relations between Russia and the United Kingdom deteriorated when the United Kingdom granted political asylum to Putin's former patron, oligarch Boris Berezovsky in 2003.  Berezovsky was found dead at his home, Titness Park, at Sunninghill, near Ascot in Berkshire, on 23 March 2013.A post-mortem examination found that his death was consistent with hanging and that there were no signs of a violent struggle. 

>The end of 2006 brought more strained relations in the wake of the death by polonium poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London.  He was  was a fugitive officer of the Russian FSB secret service who specialised in tackling organised crime. In November 1998, Litvinenko and several other FSB officers publicly accused their superiors of ordering the assassination of the Russian tycoon and oligarch Boris Berezovsky (not a good move). Litvinenko was arrested the following March on charges of exceeding the authority of his position. On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill and was hospitalised in what was established as a case of poisoning by radioactive polonium-210 which resulted in his death on 23 November, setting a Guinness World Record.  The world watched him wither away live, on air.A public enquiry began on 27 January 2015 - three weeks ago......hope they get to the bottom of it.

Wildly popular, Putin's name and image are widely used in advertisement and product branding. Among the Putin-branded products are Putinka vodka, the PuTin brand of canned food, the Gorbusha Putina caviar and a collection of T-shirts with his image. Putin also is a subject of Russian storytelling such as ""[Before Putin] There Was No Orgasm"" featured in the comedy film The Day of Elections .  

Apart from Russian, Putin speaks fluent German. His family used to speak German at home as well. After becoming President he was reported to be taking English lessons and could be seen conversing directly with Bush and native speakers of English in informal situations.  Yet he is never seen conversing with Obama.... except through an interpreter.

Finally:

Boris Nemtsov, a longtime Russian opposition leader and sharp critic of President Vladi­mir Putin, was shot and killed in central Moscow, the Russian Interior Ministry said early Saturday.

Nemtsov, a central figure in Russian political life since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, was one of the leaders of an opposition rally planned for Sunday.

There was no immediate information on who killed the 55-year-old opposition leader or a motive for the murder.

Shirley Temple receives $50,000 per film

On this day in 1936, Shirley Temple receives a new contract from 20th Century Fox that will pay the seven-year-old star $50,000 per film.
 
Temple was born in 1928 in Santa Monica, California, and started appearing in a series of short films spoofing current movies, called Baby Burlesks, at the age of four. At six, she attracted attention with her complex song-and-dance number ""Baby Take a Bow,"" performed with James Dunn, in the 1934 movie Stand Up and Cheer. Based on the film's success, 20th Century Fox signed little Shirley to a seven-year contract. She would appear in a string of films that year and the next, including Little Miss Marker, Change of Heart, Bright Eyes (which featured one of her most famous songs, the bouncy tune ""On the Good Ship Lollipop""), and Curly Top. At the height of the Great Depression, Temple's films provided a cheery alternate universe for audiences suffering the effects of widespread unemployment and general economic hardship.
 
Knowing they had a cash cow on their hands, 20th Century Fox refined the terms of Temple's contract in 1936, paying her the unprecedented sum of $50,000 per picture. They also famously altered the year on her birth certificate, making it appear that she was a year younger in order to prolong her adorable child-star status. By 1938, Temple was the No. 1 box-office draw in America. The public loved her, and she routinely upstaged her adult counterparts on the big screen. Over the course of the 1930s, the box-office success of her more than 40 films, including Poor Little Rich Girl, Wee Willie Winkie, Heidi and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, went a long way towards helping Fox weather the Depression.
 
Temple's career began to peter out in her teenage years, however, and her later films met with less and less success with audiences. In 1950, she retired from movies, though she narrated the television series Shirley Temple's Storybook from 1957 to 1959. Also in 1950, she married naval officer Charles Black, changing her name to Shirley Temple Black. (She had been previously married to Jack Agar; they wed when she was 17 and divorced after having one child, Linda.) With Black, she had two more children, Charles Jr. and Lori.
 
Some 20 years after retiring from Hollywood, Temple Black launched a political career, running as the Republican candidate for a congressional seat in San Mateo, California, in 1967 and coming in second of 14 candidates. The following year, President Richard Nixon appointed her as an ambassador to the United Nations; she worked for the State Department in the United States and overseas for more than two decades. She was the first woman to ever serve as chief of protocol, a post she held for 11 years under President Gerald R. Ford, and President George H.W. Bush named her ambassador to Czechoslovakia in 1989; by the end of her term in 1993, it had become the Czech Republic.
 
Temple Black published her autobiography, Child Star, in 1988. She still serves on the Institute of International Studies. The former child star also became a spokeswoman for breast cancer awareness after she discovered a malignant lump in her breast in 1972 and underwent a simple mastectomy. In 1999, at an event hosted by then-President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, Temple Black received a medal from the Kennedy Center for lifetime achievement to the United States and the world.
 
On February 10, 2014, Temple died at her Woodside, California, home at 85.

Thinking for the future!

Yesterday,  after posting the article on Net Neutrality I received a number of ""I am disappointed""; ""I don't likes""………  then scrolling down a bit, the pictures of the anorexic models were abhorrent to many as they were to me and I received a ""I am disappointed"" letter from one person and some other reactions including ""dislikes"".  I am OK with that, in fact the main point of this site is to make you think… to make you uncomfortable and to compel you to look into things further.  

Listening to the radio pundits and/or waiting for members of the press to provide you with queues to make up your mind about and issue is probably not going to get you to the answer.  This is the reality:

1> Alone, the idea of net neutrality means taking away the possibility of one large company, say Comcast or AT&T dominating the internet as far as speed and access.  I will not get into the technical details.  What is different is the manner in which the framework will be utilized.   What I will not do is feed into conspiracy theories regarding the possibility of the US government taking over the internet and forcing the republican internet users into FEMA trailers on the outskirts of Bouie Creek ,Louisiana where they will be forced to eat genetically altered  apples .  There are enough realities to face in this world, we don't have to imagine the boogie man and begin to fight the boogie men.  Although the imagined ""boogie men"" are easier to face, the real ones are out there and we should preserve our energy for them.

It's been less than 24 hours since the Federal Communications Commission voted to approve strict new regulations on Internet providers, but that's the leading question coming from its critics.
Conservatives are demanding that the FCC release a full copy of the regulations that it's planning to impose on companies such as Comcast and Verizon — and taking the agency's silence as evidence of a cover-up. Readers of an FCC blog post  have suspiciously mused that ""these new regulations should have been published by now."" It's much the same over on Twitter
Let's stop this nonsense right here. It's a stretch to think the FCC is withholding anything. While it was certainly within FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's power to release his draft proposal before it came to a vote, the regulations now must go through a formal process before they become official. And say what you will about bureaucratic inefficiency,  but that's the chief reason the FCC won't be releasing the rules for some time.

 Not even Internet providers, who are generally frustrated by the content of the rules, are all that outraged about the delay. They're going to see the document, sooner or later.

And guess what?  We will see it as well.

2>I publish pictures of phenomenon's that are present in our society.  Anorexia,  cruelty to children and animals and other social and cultural changes that directly affect our lives are subjects that are extremely interesting to me.  Changes in our culture, for the better or the worse directly affect our views of politics and alter the fabric of our lives.   You view the image, digest, read more on your own and think about it for yourself or bouncing the ideas off of your fellow readers.  Novel idea.

The way that we treat our symbols of authority and those who protect us such as our politicians, military and police and the interactions thereof directly influence our  choice of leaders and the direction of our country.  Religion and matters of faith are also important because a nation without faith and heart is a nation without a soul.

Finally, this sight should allow you to separate the wheat from the chaff.   Watching people on television when they are trying to get your vote will have the same basic elements as the sales pitch from the used car salesman because they are both trying to sell you something  --- one an idea the other a car…….. (both might end up lemons) .  The difference is that you will spend more time kicking the tires and you will expect more out of the used car salesman than you will the guy or gal you tend to elect.  For example, if the used car salesman tells you that the tires are new and you see that they are bald…… you probably would give that sales-person a ""what-for"".  In contrast, you will vote for some guy who will determine your and your family's future  simply by want to share a beer with him/her.  Or because you are ready for a woman instead of a man; a black instead of a white;  or because he is ""funny as heck""; or because he ""looks like me""……….   And unlike re-buying  the lemon car, you will probably re-elect the political lemon.
   
The site is unusual.  It is subtle.  I want you to think, not to tell anyone WHAT to think.  That is the way it should be.  Always......",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/800709593343167/?type=3,2015-02-27 15:50:21,14,6,11,14,0,0,0,0,0

Net Neutrality .... what's the hype?

Despite all of the political theater on Capitol Hill, the FCC's three Democratic commissioners are still planning to approve the controversial proposal promoting ""net neutrality"".  The President also wholehaeartedly approves of ""net neutrality""....... 

So.....  What does this mean?

On one side, those who are against it,  in fact  I have heard it described as "" one of the bleakest moments in the history of the Internet.""

According to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA):  ""Net neutrality is nothing more than a scheme by the multi-billion dollar silicon valley tech companies to get you, the consumer, to pay more for their services.""

According to Verizon: The rules are ""counterproductive because heavy regulation of the Internet will create uncertainty and chill investment among the many players — not just Internet service providers — that now will need to consider FCC rules before launching new services.""

One big supporter of net neutrality is:

Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., a longtime net neutrality advocate (and hater of Comcast*): ""This is a big victory. It's a win for consumers, for small businesses trying to compete with the big guys and for innovation. It's welcome news for all of us who have fought to keep the Internet free and open.""

Al Franken.......  aside ....

At its core, net neutrality is essentially about treating all content on the Internet equally. This means that big websites like Netflix and Amazon won't be given preferential treatment in relation to any other website, no matter how small. 

>Net neutrality is the principle that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally. And the new rules will ensure that whether you're checking Facebook, posting pictures to Instagram, shopping on Amazon, or streaming Netflix movies, all the information traveling across the Internet to you and from you should be treated the same. That means your Internet service provider -- whether that's a broadband company like Comcast or a wireless carrier like AT&T or Verizon -- can't block or slow down your access to that content. The new rules also ensure that a broadband provider can't pick winners and losers on the Internet by creating ""fast lanes"" that allow them to charge certain companies for priority, or faster, access to customers. 

>Net neutrality means there's nothing in the way of you accessing your favorite sites and getting your favorite content. If you're an entrepreneur looking to start your own streaming service, you'll be be treated the same as Netflix or Google when delivering videos to your customers.

>It is felt that broadband providers such as Verizon opened the door to the idea of fast lanes and toll takers by taking a more liberal interpretation of the principles, sparking the need for firmer rules.  The open nature of the Internet is critical for the fostering of new technologies and services

So why do we need the rules? It's because it will help protect the Internet from turning into a ""closed system.""

What is a ""closed system""?  Think cable television.....   

Remember the ""I want my MTV"" campaign in the 1980s? Cable networks were unwilling to put MTV in their channel lineup. So MTV started the marketing campaign to get cable subscribers to demand that their local cable operators carry the channel. Imagine if YouTube or Netflix had to get permission from your broadband provider so you could watch your favorite cat videos or the next season of Netflix's ""House of Cards"" on their network?   Think about Dish and their decision not to air Fox news.....

In the traditional cable TV model, cable operators decide which channels you get and how easy it is to find content. By contrast, broadband providers today have no control over which Web sites or online services you access. Most Internet users want to keep it that way. Net neutrality regulation ensures that happens. 

Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, argue that applying utility-like regulation to broadband is a slippery slope because it could lead to the FCC imposing new taxes on the service, which will lead to higher prices for consumers. Critics also say this new classification will discourage broadband providers from investing in their networks

The real issue is that the Comcasts and Verizons are becoming too big and too powerful. Because every web company has no choice but to go through these ISPs, the Comcasts and the Verizons may eventually have too much freedom to decide how much companies must pay for fast speeds.

We don't want ISPs blocking certain types of traffic. And we don't want them delivering their own stuff at 10 gigabits per second and everyone else's stuff at 1 gigabit. But competition is also the best way to stop these types of extreme behavior.

Ten years ago, internet traffic was ""broadly distributed across thousands of companies,"" Labovitz said in his prepared statement to the committee. But by 2009, half of all internet traffic originated in less than 150 large content and content-distribution companies, and today, half of the internet's traffic comes from just 30 outfits, including Google, Facebook, and Netflix. 

Today, a typical webpage request can involve dozens of back-and-forth communications between the browser and the web server, and even though internet packets move at the speed of light, all of that chatter can noticeably slow things down. But by getting inside the ISPs, the big web companies can significantly cut back on the delay. Over the last six years, they've essentially rewired the internet.

Internet service providers—Comcast, in particular—have started to flex their muscle. Transit provider Level 3 says that, as it sends traffic into their networks, the big U.S. ISPs are letting some of its routers overload with data. And amidst these bottlenecks, Comcast is exploring ways of selling its own CDN services that can help companies increase delivery speeds.
 
It is felt that one way to deter ""unfair competition""  --- big guys suashing the access of the ""ittle guys"" is through greater competition among ISPs. If consumers and web companies have many ISPs to choose from, no one ISP can control who gets what.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/800065916740868/?type=3,2015-02-26 11:48:38,10,9,17,10,0,0,0,0,0

Everybody Calls Someone Something.

In 2008 then Senator Obama called President Bush ""unpatriotic"" for adding trillions to the national debt. Bush added about four trillion to the debt in eight years after the 9-11 attacks and mortgage crisis. Barack Obama then added the same amount of debt in less than three years.

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said his office has received death threats since his controversial comments accusing President Barack Obama of not loving America.

""My secretary has received some death threats,"" Giuliani said in a brief interview by phone. But the former mayor emphasized the majority of the voice mails left at his office were supportive of his remarks. Giuliani did not say whether he alerted police to the threatening calls. CNN cannot confirm whether the threats were made.

As for his initial remarks that ignited the firestorm, spoken at a private dinner for Wisconsin's Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 presidential contender, Giuliani offered no apologies.

""I don't regret making the statement. I believe it,"" Giuliani said. ""I don't know if he loves America,"" he added.

""I don't feel the same enthusiasm from him for America,"" he continued during the interview.

SO....She thinks that young lads just need job training and the ability to start a business by the time they are 17 or so....  That will solve it.... they will all be Middle Eastern business men so they will not longer have those ""jihadi urges.""

In order to take a look at this phenomenon, let's gaze  tthrough the prism of the girls..... and then make our own deductions ...

In December 2012 Bethel Green High School  was inspected by Ofsted and was judged as being ""an outstanding school"".  The school used to be a single sex boys school, however between 1996-1997 after lengthy consultations and votes, the school accepted girls. Complying with rules, the school name changed from Daneford to Bethnal Green High School.

In addition to frequent name changes, the school alumni list includes a couple of athletes, a film-maker and the infamous Kray twins.Twin brothers Ronald ""Ronnie"" Kray (24 October 1933 – 17 March 1995) and Reginald ""Reggie"" Kray (24 October 1933 – 1 October 2000) were English gangsters who were the foremost perpetrators of organised crime in the East End of London during the 1950s and 1960s.  Ronald, commonly called Ron or Ronnie, most likely suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. With their gang, ""The Firm"", the Krays were involved in armed robberies, arson, protection rackets, assaults, and the murders of Jack ""The Hat"" McVitie and George Cornell.

No school or organization can answer for their alumni so ther is nothing out of the ordinary here.  What makes me curious about this ""ordinary"" school would be the three ""ordinary"" schoolgirls (pupils at the school) who  have gone missing.  They are thought to have travelled to Turkey with the intention of crossing the border into Syria. 

It is thought that they will try to join ISIS/ISIL ""aka"" the group supposedly ""not"" Islamic ..... and even though their name is  Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as Islamic State......  Are  they just misunderstood youths or young guys and gals who need jobs and/or the aility to start their own businesses by the time they are 17 so that they will not have the overwhelming urge to chop your neck or arms or have the itch to set you and your friends on fire...... after putting you in a cage?

They (the three young girls) travelled from their homes on Tuesday, February 17 and boarded a Turkish Airlines flight to Istanbul.  

Commander Richard Walton, of Scotland Yard's counter terrorism unit, described the girls as ""straight A students"" and ""normal girls"". He added: ""We are concerned about the numbers of girls and young women who have or are intending to travel to the part of Syria that is controlled by the terrorist group calling themselves Islamic State. 

 Again....what makes three middle class girls who attend a private academy where they have the intellect to attain high grades desire to leave their comfortable surroundings in order to tavel to the desert and become women in total submission to barbarians living in a primitive existance of religious dogma?  If it were as simple as having job opportunities and the ability to start a business at the age of 17, are they not leaving this?   

Last year, twin teenage sisters, Zahra and Salma Halane, disappeared from their home in Manchester and flew to Istanbul, bound for Syria. Also straight ""A"" students, the pair, who had dreamed of pursuing medical careers, later became jihadi brides, but were widowed when both their husbands were killed fighting for Isil. 

In December, it was revealed that a 15-year-old girl had been prevented from joining Isil after police dramatically stopped her flight on the runway at Heathrow.The teenager, from Tower Hamlets, London, had secretly saved up money for her flight to Turkey, without her parents' knowledge in the hope of travelling on to Syria.  But counter-terrorism officers, who had been tipped over about her plans, raced to the airport and stopped her plane which had already begun taxiing on to the runway. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11424884/Three-missing-British-schoolgirls-travel-to-Syria.html

Mona Sahlin, Sweden's national coordinator against extremism and violence, said that girls have also been trafficked to Yemen and south Asian countries such as Afghanistan to fight for the militant group. 

And the religious origin of the girls don't matter either..... French authorities found that a Jewish girl is among some 100 girls and young women from France who have left to join jihad fighters in Syria in recent months. A survey earlier this yearr found that 16% of French respondents hold favorable views of the Islamic State.

And not just European girls .......  

Three US girls, reportedly traveling to Turkey to join ISIL terrorists, were stopped midway in Germany and sent back to the United States.  US officials refused to confirm any links between ISIL and the girls, from Denver, Colorado, who went missing.  Two of the juveniles have Somali origin and the other Sudanese. They are thought to be between the ages of 15 and 17.

If they just need employment opportunities  and business ""seed"" money..... then why travel to the location where there are supposedly none of the aforementioned attributes?

Answer:  Ideology.

In recent months, thousands of people from Europe are said to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight for the ISIL, which currently controls large areas of the two countries.
 
According to an October report by the UN Security Council, 15,000 foreigners have flocked to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside the ISIL or other terrorist groups.
 
European countries have repeatedly expressed concern over the ISIL's influence across the continent. Authorities fear that the European militants will use their combat skills against their countries upon returning home.

""These departures are less the whims of adolescents and more the highly organized conclusions of months of legwork by networks that specifically target young people in search of an identity, according to families, lawyers and security officials. These mostly online networks recruit girls to serve as wives, babysitters and housekeepers for jihadis, with the aim of planting multi-generational roots for an Islamic caliphate.""

Cyberbullying and Trolls......

>The father of two teen boys who allegedly bullied a Minnesota girl with racist comments on Snapchat has reportedly been fired from his job.
 
The alleged case of cyberbullying became a national news story when the father of the girl made an emotional plea on YouTube, seeking to force his daughter's bullies to ""own"" their comments.

In the nearly six-minute video, Brad Knudson played a voice-mail message that he said he received from the boys' father, Deron Puro. In the message, Puro used a racial slur.
 
According to KMSP, Puro's employer confirmed that as of Jan. 21, he was no longer associated with the financial firm, where he worked as an independent contractor.
 
Knudson's video has been seen more than 1.3 million times since it was posted Monday.......  In it, he explained that he and his wife adopted their African American daughter, Dierdra, 11 years ago.

The boys stated online in Snap Chat:  

""You's a fat a– b—-, yes you are,"" ; ""You're a s—,"" one teen said, adding the n-word.

>Trolling is internet slang for a person who intentionally starts arguments or upsets others by posting inflammatory remarks. The sole purpose of trolling is angering people. It has been compared to flaming in cyberbullying. Plus, many people who troll think what they do is an ""art"". 

The best advice for dealing with being trolled is to ignore rather than engage with a troll. In other words, ""Please do not feed the trolls.""
 
Cyberbullying:    
 
Cyberbullying is deliberate and repeated harm inflicted through using the Internet, interactive and digital technologies, or mobile phones

What to do if you are a victim of cyberbullying:

 •Don't respond. If you don't respond they may get bored and search for another victim. Plus, if the person who is cyberbullying is anonymous, responding will do no good because these individuals don't know when to stop.  

 •Block the person(s). Change your social networking settings to prevent the person who is cyberbullying from accessing your personal information on your profile. If need be change your user name and passwords.

 •Keep a record of the derogatory remarks, just in case you need them as evidence. So save screenshots, posts, etc. that you can use in the event that you need to take it to the next step, i.e., legal action.

 •Be selective about what you post. Don't post information online that someone can use against you.

As a person who works in the public and posts regularly, I expect to be both trolled and cyberbullied.  I tend not to respond to the trolls or bullies because the intent is to quiet voices and silence the demons in their own heads that scream for conformity.......In specific, conformity to their own ideas.  I am not easily bullied nor trolled.

As for desparaging remarks about race, ethnicity and religion, It is really NOT cool to ""go there"".  My family and I attend the most beautiful Passover meal every year for the past 10 years or so.  I feel priviledged to be in the embrace of such spirituality.  One year my husband and I experienced the Holiday in Israel.  We have been Blessed with the oportunity.  Looking outside what is customary for your family and background is part of the rich threads in the fabric of your life.  I know that it has enriched mine.  My daughters have gone with their friends to Beijing. China; Nicaragua, Norway, and soon the British Isles.  Much the same as I backpacked through most of Europe - Germany, Switzerland, italy, England, Czech Republic and so on.... when I was their age.  My husband Allen speaks fluent Italian, Spanish, some German and Farsi.  He has his own yarmulke's made especially for him and loves Israel as his spiritual home.  

We are ""different"", and we will not be silenced by either bullies or trolls.  Be bold, be courageous and strive for ""right"" and ""good"".  You might not be ""popular"" but you will feel peace in your heart.  AND always check that the words you say have value to those who read them and are not used to abuse those who might take a gander upon them...  There is never a reason to diminish someone's appearance so much as they can not change it.  And finally:

If you Believe.....  Stand up in Faith.  Even if you stand alone.

PLEASE don't leave!  We Need ALL you Got!

French President François Hollande, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, and Senate President Gerard Larcher attended a ceremony Tuesday morning at the Sarre-Union Jewish Cemetery in Eastern France, where 250 gravestones were either broken or toppled over on Sunday.

The ceremony opened with the Kaddish prayer, followed by a sixth grade student reciting a poem by a Holocaust survivor, Italian Jewish writer Primo Levi, If This is a Man. Strasbourg Chief Rabbi Rene Gutman denounced the ""systematic destruction'' of the cemetery, noting the damage was ""as if an army has passed through here.""

Please don't Leave......

""France is your [French Jews] homeland. This time also, the Republic will defend you with all its might, because through you, the values, the principles, the promise of our country are all targeted.""

The president was echoing a remark Monday by Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who called upon the local Jewish community to remain in France.

This comes on the heels of:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday urged European Jews to move to Israel after a Jewish man was killed in an attack outside Copenhagen's main synagogue.

""To the Jews of Europe and to the Jews of the world I say that Israel is waiting for you with open arms,"" Netanyahu said.

He had made a similar call after three days of bloodshed in Paris that started with the January 7 attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo where 12 people were gunned down, followed the next day by the shooting death of a policewoman just outside the city.

I did not think about this situation until today when I ran across a video showing 10 hours in the life of a Jew in France.......  

This video depicts Zvika Klein donning a yarmulke while standing in front of the Eiffel Tower. He also wears a tasseled prayer garment known as a tzitzit to emphasize his identity.  

Viewers then watch him walk around Paris, while being secretly recorded by a GoPro camera equipped to a colleague in front of him.

The 10-hour walk was condensed into a minute and half, during which Klein passes by several people on the street who heckle him for being Jewish. Some of them simply call out ""Jew"" or ""Juif."" Others are more aggressive, spitting on the ground, swearing at him, and telling him Jews shouldn't be in the area.

How many of us would get the ""warm and fuzzy"" feeling being spat at; cursed as; threatened and taunted by menacing strangers. Insulted and hated for the way that he looked... what he stood for......  His Faith.........

Take a look for yourself....:http://www.syracuse.com/us-news/index.ssf/2015/02/jewish_man_walks_around_paris_anti-semitic_abuse_video.html

Jair Melchior, Denmark's chief rabbi, said on Sunday he was ""disappointed"" by Netanyahu's call for immigration, stating that ""terror is not a reason to move to Israel."" 

Living in terror, however, might be a reason.  And by the way, France is concerned about its economy and losing 600k citizens, not because they care about the Jewish community. 

The Jews are France's economy.

Israel's Cabinet approved a more than $46 million plan to encourage immigration and to adapt the absorption process to Jews from France, Belgium and Ukraine.
 
The plan was approved Sunday, hours after a gunman killed a volunteer Jewish guard at a synagogue in Copenhagen.
 
""We say to Jews, to our brothers and sisters: Israel is your home. We are preparing and calling for the absorption of mass immigration from Europe. I would like to tell all European Jews and all Jews wherever they are: 'Israel is the home of every Jew,'"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before the vote. ""To the Jews of Europe and to the Jews of the world I say that Israel is waiting for you with open arms.""

Something to consider?

Parallels of a Tragic Comedy

>The government of Rome held off revolts and pacified the populace  through ""bread and circuses,"" i.e.providing people free bread and free entertainment (chariot races in the Circus Maximus, gladiator fights and other events in the Colosseum). 

The government of America holds off questions and pacifies the populace  through ""bread and circuses,"" i.e.providing people with free cell phones, welfare, and free community college along with the Final Four Brackets, Lotteries and colosseum sporting events of all types. 

>When Rome was a republic, its army was composed of citizens who had a personal stake in its well-being. Later, the citizen army was replaced by an army of mercenaries, many of whom were completely untrustworthy, especially against a strong enemy. Thus, what was once the world's most powerful army became weak. 

America is still a republic, its army IS composed of citizens who had a personal stake in its well-being. However, it is being weakened, both in numbers and morale. Warriors put out to pasture while political speech masters posing in warrior like outfits craft fanciful words of folly meant to please their masters or at least shore up a position after early retirement.

The Five O'Clock Follies was a sobriquet for military press briefings that occurred during the Vietnam War. Richard Pyle, Associated Press Saigon bureau chief during the war, described the briefings as, ""the longest-playing tragicomedy in Southeast Asia's theater of the absurd.""

The briefings occurred in a bar on the roof of Saigon's Rex Hotel, and journalists alternately cracked cynical jokes and shouted at officials, often complaining about a credibility gap between official reports and the truth. public affairs officer Barry Zorthian led the briefings, and he once lamented that where the US government's word was once true until proven false, in Vietnam it would be questioned until proven true

Journalists updated the name during the Gulf War. Press briefings at that time were unofficially known as the ""Four O'Clock Follies.  Wikipedia

We now have the ""all day follies"", with talking points such as ""We have got them (Al Qaeda) on their heels"" or ""on the run"" or ""decimated"" or ""broken"" or ""battered"" or ""crying"" or ""sucking their thumbs"" or ""peeing their nappies"" ........  Too bad no one informed Al Qaeda, ISIS or ISIL or ..... They are convinced they are growing..... and recruiting and conquering.

>The Roman economy was weakened by foreign trade deficits. Gold and silver were sent to China to buy silk; the Roman currency had to be devalued. 

The budget deficit shrank to $483 billion in 2014, or 2.8 percent of the economy. That's down from 9.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, and the Congressional Budget Office projects deficits will continue to narrow until 2017.  BUT the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office set the record straight with a warning.  The CBO cautioned that America's unaffordable public programs and crushing debt will condemn us to anemic economic growth.

Total federal debt will reach $22.3 TRILLION  by 2020. Unsustainable, says the CBO — especially when now-low interest rates return to normal.

Don't count on spendaholics in Congress to take this warning seriously. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), for example, responded to the CBO by boasting about this year' s $468 billion federal deficit — the smallest since Obama took office — and smirking at ""Republican rhetoric about 'a big government' boogeyman.""

More folly.

>Dividing the empire was supposed to make it easier to govern and rule, but I have not seen any evidence that it worked that way. 

Dividing the American population by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, political persuasion, and so forth is supposed to make it easier to rule, get votes and ultimately govern as people focus in on the differences, their eyes and mind are riveted away from what is important --- the ties that bind and focused on the differences that tear apart.  Either that or they check out and pay attention to the latest pictorial  iteration of a Kardashians oily rear end or which 85 or 90 year old man has decided to become an 85 or  90 year old woman named Myrtle or Edna or Gertrude or Dot.

>Infighting for power, and the fact that almost all the latter emperors assumed power after murdering their predecessors undoubtedly weakened the empire. People must have felt very cynical about their leaders, and they certainly could not have felt much loyalty.

We are about to enter into the 2016 election season, and the personal ""bloodbath"" is about to commence.  It will first take place in the primary, where members of the same team will rip each other limb from limb.  Truths, half-truths and whole lies will be paraded out for the world to see.  Destruction will be complete and then the victors will enter the colosseum where the modern gladiators and their acolytes will vie for the public attention.........At least those paying attention which is usually less than 30 percent .... on and off.

Ah, the more things change, the more they remain the same.......  Lest you might think differently......   Leaders of  ISIS have reportedly cut off the hands of three women as punishment for unknown charges and publicly flogged men for using mobile phones.

More Random Killings by the JV Team and Other Nutty Stuff.

Before the killings, one of the militants stood holding a knife and said in a North American-accented English: ""O Crusaders, safety for you will be only wishes, especially when you're fighting us all together. Therefore, we will fight you all together, until the war lays down its burdens, and Jesus, peace be upon him, will descend, breaking the cross, killing the swine and abolishing jiziyah.""

""O Crusaders"".......  ""Crusaders""......  Did our ""leader annouce last week that we should stay off of our ""high horses"" lest we forget that we should feel convicted by the fact that we, as Christians, were once part of the ""Crusades"".  My, how similar the thinking of the leader of the free world and the ""JV team"" of ""beheaders"" in the Middle East.

But I digress......

Business as usual......  The prisoners were then forced down to their knees, and then beheaded.

Who were these ""prisoners""?  Well, they were 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians.  Christianity is the largest and most widely spread faith in the world, with 2.2 billion followers, or 32 percent of the world population, according to a survey by the U.S.-based Pew Forum on religion and Public Life.

It faces restrictions and hostility in 111 countries, far more than the occurrence with the second-largest faith, Islam,

Nine of the 10 countries listed as dangerous for Christians are Muslim-majority states, many of them torn by conflicts with radical Islamists. Saudi Arabia is an exception but ranked sixth because of its total ban on practicing faiths other than Islam.  

And the Saudi guys are supposed to be our friends!  Well, ""the oil"" works in mysterious ways.  And lest you think of me as blasphemous,,,,,,  This particular phrase with ""the Lord"" in the place of ""the oil"", is not found anywhere in the Bible, although it is often misquoted as being a Bible verse.

Also this weekend.....   A gunman shouting 'Allahu akbar' targeted free-speech activists, policemen and Jews in a 14-hour rampage through Copenhagen this weekend, killing two men and wounding five people, in attacks that plunged another European capital into terror just over a month after the Paris shootings.

Earlier this weekend, those ""wily"" bunch of ""junior varsity"" members aka ""ISIS fighters"" attacked the base where over 300 US Marines are stationed.

Eight suicide bombers managed Friday to get onto a sprawling Iraqi military base where hundreds of U.S. Marines are training their Iraqi counterparts, but were killed by an ISF counter attack almost immediately.

The US Marines at Al-Asad airbase has been under frequent attack since January.But today ISIS seized large swaths of the city.

An idealistic young aid worker from Prescott Arizona, by the name of Kayla Mueller also lost her life flying too close to this group of ""amateurs.""

All of these matter not, next to the changing climate, which we are told is the most pressing thing that we should be concerned about.  We are experiencing so much global warming that we have record snow fall and frigid temperatures for the the second year in a row.  You see, ""global warming"" works in reverse.......  

Ah, so many pesky items to go over.  No wonder the Prez decided that we need a ""break""..... or maybe a warning that the real cost of O-Care is about to kick in and shove its ""pointy"" boot right up your......... wallet.  That's right folks the ""penalty"" phase is getting higher!  So, Mizz Nancy Pelosi said that the best Valentine's Day gift you could give your best guy or gal is a night with a glass of wine or three fingers of hard liquor filling out the O-Care screen.  Warms your heart on a snowy evening when you press the button and think  about the five people on the other side of the country who will now use your information to obtain their very own Mastercard, Visa or Discovery cards..... maybe even all three!  How's THAT for ""spreading the wealth""!

Meanwhile, in la vida loca nation, the President of the United States, Commander in Chief, the leader of the free world, is just like us — a YOLOing, selfie-snapping regular Joe who also likes to steal his buddy's aviator sunglasses (Vice President Joe Biden, in this case) and blast some finger guns in the mirror.  

I say this tongue in cheek, since I don't know anyone older than 17 years old who should conduct himself in this manner.  At least without checking first if anyone is looking.  

 ""Speak softly and carry a big stick."" Teddy Roosevelt picked it up in West Africa.  ""In a letter written in 1900, a year before he became president, Theodore Roosevelt wrote, ""I have always been fond of the West African proverb: `Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.'' 

Today, that big stick is a selfie stick, with President Obama speaking slang, making strange facial movements, hamming it up and flaunting his slight frame in a very tight disco ready suit. It all cool though, because it will spur you to find medical help..... or care depending on your take. 

ISIS/ISIL might not be the only JV team..... the ""diff"" is..... they are moving towards the varsity squad while we sink to the middle school prep squad.

The only argument offered is that whites are more prosperous and healthier socially than are blacks, which proves white privilege as much as blacks' numerical dominance in the NBA proves black privilege. After all, Hindus (exclusively non-white) are the highest-earning religious group in the U.S., and Jews are number two, yet no one today takes this as proof of Hindu or Jewish privilege. In fact, in a radio debate some years ago I challenged a different guest — who cited whites' higher incomes as proof of privilege — to be true to his rationale and speak of Jewish privilege (which he wouldn't dare do).

428053320608798_788575307889929,"Good Thursday Afternoon!

Terrible Deeds in the Name of Christ……. The Fall of Christianity in America by Relativisms 

The doctrine of relativism posits that no ideas or beliefs are universally true but that all are, instead, ""relative"" — that is, their validity depends on the circumstances in which they are applied.  Today, at the National Prayer Breakfast, the nation received a sermon on the relativism, from the President of the United States of America.  

The speech he made this morning details how you can claim equivalency between the barbaric head chopping and the burning alive of a human being……You just have to invoke the memory of the bad old white people of the past…. of course! President Obama stated:

""Unless we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ,"" Obama said. ""In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.""

Shame on us for being so hard on the young lads of ISIS or ISIL…….  Remember the Crusades!  Remember the Inquisitions!  For those of you with ""short memories"" , first crusade was launched by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095. There is controversy over the last crusade. ""Traditionalists"" would end the crusades in 1291 with the fall of the last crusader castle of the Latin Kingdom, the city of Acre (on the northern coast of present-day Israel).  

OK, I don't want to get into too much detail about the debate between in the timeline of the ""traditionalists"" and the ""pluralists"", however, rest assured that no one alive today attended any of the ""crusades"".  Neither did your Mom and Dad nor anyone else either in your family or on the block….  I don't care how old they are.  

Some historians see the Crusades as part of a purely defensive war against Islamic conquest; some see them as part of long-running conflict at the frontiers of Europe; and others see them as confident, aggressive, papal-led expansion attempts by Western Christendom. Crusading attracted men and women of all classes. The massacres involved were mainly attributed as being caused by disorder and economic distress.  Riley-Smith, Johnathan (1995). The Oxford Illustrated history of the Crusades. Oxford: Oxford Press. p. 66
The Persecution of Jews in the First Crusade is part of the long history of anti-Semitism in Europe.

The Church organized minor Crusades with limited goals after 1291–mainly military campaigns aimed at pushing Muslims from conquered territory or conquering pagan regions–support for such efforts disappeared in the 16th century, with the rise of the Reformation and the corresponding decline of papal authority.

So……  you can't recall the Crusades……. What about the Inquisition?  The Inquisition was a Roman Catholic tribunal for discovery and punishment of heresy, which was marked by the severity of questioning and punishment and lack of rights afforded to the accused.

Initially a tribunal would open at a location and an edict of grace would be published calling upon those who are conscious of heresy to confess; after a period of grace, the tribunal officers could make accusations. Those accused of heresy were sentenced at an auto de fe, Act of Faith. Clergyman would sit at the proceedings and would deliver the punishments. Punishments included confinement to dungeons, physical abuse and torture. Those who reconciled with the church were still punished and many had their property confiscated, as well as were banished from public life. Those who never confessed were burned at the stake without strangulation; those who did confess were strangled first. During the 16th and 17th centuries, attendance at auto de fe reached as high as the attendance at bullfights. http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Inquisition.html

If you can't remember those atrocities enough to feel guilty …….. well, it could be because by the second half of the 18th century, the Inquisition abated, due to the spread of enlightened ideas and lack of resources.

Ok…… What about Jim Crow?  The key here is spread around the guilt evenly…….the educated White Christians can feel convicted about their ancestral role in the Crusades and Inquisition….. so now let's throw in ""Jim Crow"" as the ""racial seasoning"" to the relativism stew…

 The Jim Crow laws were racial segregation state and local laws enacted after the Reconstruction period in Southern United States that continued in force until 1965 mandating de jure racial segregation in all public facilities in Southern U.S. states (of the former Confederacy), starting in 1890 with a ""separate but equal"" status for African Americans. The separation in practice led to conditions for African Americans that were inferior to those provided for white Americans. It institutionalized a number of economic, educational and social disadvantages. De jure segregation mainly applied to the Southern United States, while Northern segregation was generally de facto — patterns of segregation in housing enforced by covenants, bank lending practices and job discrimination, including discriminatory union practices for decades. 
Jim Crow laws mandated the segregation of public schools, public places and public transportation, and the segregation of restrooms, restaurants and drinking fountains for whites and blacks. The U.S. military was also segregated, as were federal workplaces, initiated in 1913 under President Woodrow Wilson, the first Southern president since 1856. His administration practiced overt racial discrimination in hiring, requiring candidates to submit photos.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws

Today, At the National Prayer Breakfast, President Obama reminded attendees that violence rooted in religion isn't exclusive to Islam, but has been carried out by Christians as well.

But here is the difference……..  the President  NAMED, the Crusades, the Inquisition, and Jim Crow….. thus convicting the participants who were White Christians – that is easy.  He has YET to name radical Islam and the members thereof  as the perpetrators of any of the atrocities we have witnessed within the past few months and ramped up within the past few days.  .  In fact, these jihadists from ISIS or ISIL have been referred to as everything short of ""mis-understood youths"".  In fact CNN's Amanpour calls Charlie Hebdo terrorists 'activists'….. as though setting someone on fire while they are alive and awake or chopping off heads is analogous to staging a ""sit-in"" in the local college cafeteria..

Jew Hating, Tolerance and the American College Campus

Title VI of the Civil Rights act of 1964 prohibits various forms of discrimination at federally funded programs, including higher educational institutions, but the Obama administration's Department of Education has so far refused to enforce it against federally funded universities and colleges that have allowed anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students to go on with relative impunity. For example, in a letter rejecting a complaint that had accused a California state university of allowing a hostile environment for Jewish students to exist on campus, the education department's Office for Civil Rights wrote: ""In the university environment, exposure to such robust and discordant expressions, even when personally offensive and hurtful, is a circumstance that a reasonable student in higher education may experience. In this context, the events that the complainants described do not constitute actionable harassment."" 

Hmmmm......  a discordant mumble against immigrants, members of the LGBT community will be met by screams of ""hate speech"" and attempts to censure the speech of the offender but any outburst against a member of the Jewish faith is classified as  ""robust and discordant expressions"".

Let's take a look at the following experiment:

Filmmaker Ami Horowitz headed to the University of California, Berkeley, one of the most prestigious and selective universities in the country, to assess students' reactions to two very different, but powerful symbols.

He took to the university campus waving an infamous black-and-white flag - the emblem of the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS/ISIL).

""ISIS is misunderstood. We just want our own state. Why does America keep bombing us? America and Western imperialism are to blame, not ISIS,"" he was shouting in the video released by Fox news on Wednesday. 

However, the students, who Horowitz says in his blog ""clearly have a lot of intellect,"" didn't react at all.

""A couple of thousand students walked by me and not saying anything negative. In fact, there were some positive responses. [It] really blew me away,"" he said in an interview with RT. ""Not a single person has a negative response. It was completely shocking.""

There was no harsh condemnation of the group and no one mentioned the IS' beheading of three US citizens.

One passerby nodded towards Horowitz and said, ""Good luck."" 

Good Luck...... indeed......

When Horowitz he returned with an Israeli flag, trying to show the 'tolerance' of Berkeley students. 
However, he received less-than-warm reception as the students started assailing him with hatred.

""F*** Israel,"" exclaimed one man, ""You're killing kids,"" said another.

""All of Israel are killers,"" added a woman.

""That flag you wave is the psychological genocide of this planet. This institution is part of the people who enslaved the whole planet,"" one of passerby said in a tirade.

In his RT interview, Horowitz said that one student told him that Israel is ""the worst country in Europe,"" not actually knowing that Israel is located in the Middle East. ""It made me wonder about the educational system we have in the US unfortunately,"" he added. 

So, our education system has enforced in the minds of some of the ""brightest"",  ""most talented"" and ""pampered""  helicopter children in the world the idea that beheading, live immolation, and sexual slavery of women deserve the ""two thumbs up"" while Israel needs to go get ""f***ed"".

http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/joseph-klein/the-alarming-rise-of-campus-anti-semitism/

Now, according to an article by the Washington Times, the University of California, Davis campus, had a vote passed by their student government that can be deemed anti-Israel. The resolution that passed, eight to two on Thursday, February 28th, formally recommended that the university divest from companies who do business with Israel as part of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. This includes American companies like Caterpillar Inc., G4S PLC, Veolia Environment, and Raytheon.

Right after the vote, a large pro-Palestinian group of students shouted ""Allahu Akhbar,"" which means ""Allah is [the] greatest."" This was done as pro-Israel students filed out of the student government meeting room, as shown by the student-shot video attached below.

Yep........""Allahu Akhbar "" is now similar to a college ""love tap"", complete with its message of tolerance and understanding.

>""Allahu Akhbar "",  the words uttered by Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan,  in a shooting rampage that left  30 people wounded and 7 dead at Fort Hood....

>A driver shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he ploughed into groups of people in the eastern French city of Dijon in December.

>After last month's heinous attack on the offices of satirical paper Charlie Hebdo. The attackers are reported to have shouted ""Allahu Akbar!"" (God is great) as they opened fire, killing 12 people. 

>Finally,Isis, ISIL (or whatever they are calling themselves this month) has released a video showing men and young boys gathering to watch the burning to death of a Jordanian pilot on large screens around Raqqa, the group's Syrian stronghold.
The video, entitled 'Muslims' joy at burning of Jordanian Pilot', shows crowds cheering and chanting what appears to be ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great) as First Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh is set on fire in a cage.

Ah, who can fight the feelings of togetherness that this phrase ""Allahu Akhbar "" engenders?   

After years of violin lessons, planned play activities, programmed days, trips to Europe, Mandarin Chinese classes, medication, dance classes, pilates, vegan anti gluten diets, therapy,  sensitivity training an anti-bullying classes........ our young college aged cherubs have become cultural bullies with no knowledge that this has all been done before with disastrous consequences......   In this topsy turvy world that has now come to define American higher education and our youth, hating Israel is ""tolerated""...... anything else is considered ""Islamophobic"" or something phobic........

How's that for ""higher education"" and tolerance?",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/788206897926770/?type=3,2015-02-04 19:33:38,50,14,37,50,0,0,0,0,0

America Become Tragic Comedy.

Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee has made history by becoming the first woman of either party to lead the prestigious House Judiciary subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security and investigations. This subcommittee was created in 1813 in the 13th Congress. Jackson Lee is one of only 6 women to have served in the sub committee. Houstonian Barbara Jordan was among them.

Jackson Lee graduated from Jamaica High School in Queens. She earned a B.A. in political science from Yale University in 1972, followed by a J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1975. She is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

Sheila Jackson Lee (born January 12, 1950) is the U.S. Representative for Texas's 18th congressional district, serving since 1995. The district includes most of inner-city Houston. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

She has certainly been......  well interesting..... especially ...  Well see for yourself:

>At a Homeland Security Committee hearing on radical Muslims in the US, held in March 2011, Jackson Lee said that Peter King's hearings were helping al-Qaeda and ""going the same route as Arizona."" She complained that the hearings were scaring Muslim Americans and called them ""an outrage.""

>In 1997, while on a trip to the Mars Pathfinder operations center in California, Jackson Lee confused the planet Mars with Earth's own moon, asking whether the Pathfinder had succeeded in taking a picture of the flag planted on Mars by Neil Armstrong in 1969.

>While handing out lollipops to illegal aliens on the Texas border, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee claimed the unprecedented invasion of criminals was not a security crisis.
""This is not a national security crisis.""Sheila Jackson Lee, July 3, 2014 

>Speaking on the House Floor, rocket scientist Sheila Jackson Lee claimed the United States had operated under the Constitution since 1614.
""Maybe I should offer a good thanks to the distinguished members of the majority, the Republicans, my chairman and others, for giving us an opportunity to have a deliberative constitutional discussion that reinforces the sanctity of this nation and how well it is that we have lasted some 400 years, operating under a constitution that clearly defines what is constitutional and what is not.""
Sheila Jackson Lee, March 12, 2014 

>Speaking to fellow Democrats, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee seemed to think the goal of Democrats in Congress was to write Executive Orders for President Obama.
""I believe this caucus will put us on the right path and we'll give President Obama a number of executive orders that he can sign with pride and strength.""
Sheila Jackson Lee, January 29, 2014 

>As usual, Sheila Jackson Lee took to the House Floor and confused people, demanding unemployment insurance payments for the employed.
""Let us vote to provide for unemployment insurance for working men and women so that faces across America will not have the tear of desperation on their faces.""
Sheila Jackson Lee, December 12, 2013 

>Speaking on the House floor, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee defended gang members committing crimes with guns.
""Don't condemn the gangbangers, they've got guns that are trafficked, that are not enforced, that are straw purchased and they come into places even that have strong gun laws. Why? Because we don't have sensible gun legislation.""
Sheila Jackson Lee, April 9, 2013

Clips of Jackson in action:

>Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee had an interesting view on the Vietnam War, and on how two separate Vietnams apparently still exist in peace.
""And I want to say to my colleagues that I stand here asking us to do what we did not do in Vietnam. Was to recognize the valiant and outstanding service of our men and women. And to understand that victory had been achieved. Today we have two Vietnams, side by side, North and South, exchanging and working. We may not agree with all North Vietnam is doing, but they are living in peace. I would look for better human rights record for North Vietnam, but they're living side by side. Because that was a civil war. And because the leadership of this nation did not listen to the mothers and fathers who borned the burden of 58,000 dead and did not declare victory, the mounting death, the violence continued going up and up. Rather than understanding the political nature of the war in Vietnam, we did not listen to those families.""
Sheila Jackson Lee, July 15, 2010

It Was All Malarkey After All.

The definition of ""malarkey"" is speech or writing designed to obscure, mislead, or impress.

Well, it certainly did that…. But first read the recantation and understand that this is the story of a young man by the name of Alex Malarkey who told a story of what he experienced while he lay in a coma after a car accident when he was 6 years old. The coma lasted two months, and his injuries left him paralyzed, but the subsequent spiritual memoir – with its assuring description of ""miracles, angels, and life beyond This World"" – became part of a popular genre of ""heavenly tourism.""

I never saw the movie nor read the book, however, my children did and they were very moved by the story.
  
Alex Malarkey now writes:

""Please forgive the brevity, but because of my limitations I have to keep this short. … I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention. When I made the claims that I did, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough. The Bible is the only source of truth. Anything written by man cannot be infallible.""

From the beginning, I felt that this story was somewhat of a harmless fantasy.  I thought that since the human memory has a tendency to be faulty, at best, this story might just be a way that Alex's psyche had of coping with the change in his life.
  
Last April, Alex's mother, Beth Malarkey, posted a statement on her own blog decrying the memoir and its promotion: ""It is both puzzling and painful to watch the book 'The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven' not only continue to sell, but to continue, for the most part, to not be questioned."" She goes on to say that the book is not ""Biblically sound"" and that her son's objections to it were ignored and repressed. She also notes that Alex ""has not received monies from the book nor have a majority of his needs been funded by it.""
He did not benefit from the book at all……. But who did?  The parents are now divorced…..  The 2010 memoir, ""The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven,"" was written by Alex Malarkey and his father, Kevin Malarkey, a Christian therapist in Ohio.

In 2004, when Alex was 6, he was badly injured in an automobile accident. Alex ended up in a coma for two months, and the book claims to tell the story of his trips to heaven during that time.
And…… In Alex Malarkey's defense, he was six years old at the time, having just emerged from a coma and likely confused and scared and hurting. He did something lots of people do as kids—invent some fantasy they think their parents might want to hear. And it probably took a lot of nerve to come clean.

Alex Malarkey is now a teenager. In 2009, he became the first child to have ""Christopher Reeve surgery,"" which allows him to breathe without a ventilator.  That is a miracle in and of itself.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/778055525608574/?type=3,2015-01-16 15:57:40,21,12,8,21,0,0,0,0,0

WASHINGTON – Federal prosecutors are recommending that retired Army Gen. David Petraeus face criminal charges for passing classified information to his former mistress, Paula Broadwell, according to two U.S. officials.

Petraeus, who resigned as CIA director after news of his affair broke in 2012, has been under investigation since then for passing secret information to Broadwell. She is the author of a biography of Petraeus, titled All In. The officials who confirmed the recommendation, first reported by The New York Times, were not authorized to speak publicly.

A lawyer for Petraeus, Robert Barnett, had no comment when contacted about the recommended charges on Friday night. Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon declined comment on Friday as well.

Since his resignation, Petraeus has been interviewed by FBI agents at his home in the Washington suburb of Arlington. Part of the investigation centered on whether Petraeus had given Broadwell sensitive information and whether those documents were stored in an unauthorized place.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/774601609287299/?type=3,2015-01-09 20:09:49,11,8,2,11,0,0,0,0,0

The Trouble in France…….  And Where Else to Come....

Three French terror suspects are dead at two separate hostage standoff locations, according to the City Hall of Dammartin and the French ambassador to the U.S.

 Said and Cherif Kouachi were shot after reportedly emerging from their bolt hole firing at police.

Minutes later armed officers stormed the Jewish supermarket in eastern Paris where Amedy Coulibaly had been locked in a bloody stand off.

At least four people, including the attacker, are believed to have been killed at the kosher grocery store, police officials said.  The four hostages were killed before the police operation began, reports say.
Coulibaly had threatened to kill hostages if police acted against the Kouachis.

What could make French citizens kill their own countrymen?

Cherif Kouachi, 32, has already spent time in a French prison and it is alleged that his brother Said, 34, trained in Yeman.   The two men are French, of Algerian origin and were brought up in France. Sources say that even before this week the brothers had been on the US No Fly list, and were known to the French security service. 
Said Kouachi's French identity card was found in the first getaway car. Press reports later said that DNA testing from the car had matched the ID card. 

According to reports, Cherif grew up in an orphanage in Rennes, trained as a fitness coach, had at one time been part of a rap group, and worked delivering pizzas in Paris.  Cherif was detained by police in 2005 while attempting to fly to Syria, and in 2008 was jailed for helping to send militants to Iraq, and served 18 months of a 3 year sentence. 

His brother Said is reported to have visited Yemen in 2011 to train with al-Qaeda-affiliated militants. It is alleged that they regularly visited a mosque in the Stalingrad area of Paris, where they spent time with a radical imam called Farid Benyettou.

Amedy Coulibaly was born in 1982 in the Paris suburb of Juvisy-sur-Orge as the only boy in a family of 10 children, according to French media citing police reports. He spent time in and out of prison starting in 2001, when he was convicted for robbery. French police believe he converted to radical Islam while in prison for armed robbery in 2005, the same time he met Sharif Kouachi in prison, French media reported, citing police investigative files. The two men became devoted followers of Djamel Beghal, a French-Algerian man with ties to al-Qaeda who was convicted of plotting in 2001 to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Paris.
 
When Coulibaly was freed in 2006, he took a  job at a Coca-Cola factory outside Paris. French security services apparently deemed him safe enough to meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009, when Coulibaly was reported to have plans to meet with the leader as part of an effort to promote youth employment.
 ""I'll enjoy it,"" Coulibaly told le Parisien newspaper in July 2009, the day before he was scheduled to meet with Sarkozy. But ""in truth, in the cities, with youth, Sarkozy isn't very popular. But it's nothing personal. In fact, that's the case with the majority of politicians,"" he said.

 Coulibaly was apparently still engaged in quiet militant activity. Just 10 months after his meeting with Sarkozy, police searched his apartment and found 240 rounds of 7.62mm rifle ammunition – the caliber used in most Kalashnikov assault rifles. He told police at the time that he planned to sell the ammunition on the street, not use it himself. Police said Coulibaly tried to break another militant Islamist, Smain Ait Ali Belkacem, out of prison in 2013. Although he was convicted and sentenced in 2013 to five years in prison related to the prison-break attempt, he was released early.

Two of the dead — Ahmed Merabet, a police officer, and Mustapha Ourad, who was working in the Charlie Hebdo office — were themselves Muslim. Many fellow Muslims were among the crowds that poured on to the streets on Wednesday night in a show of solidarity for the Charlie Hebdo victims.

Jihadist networks span Europe from Poland to Portugal, thanks to the spread of radical Islam among the descendants of guest workers once recruited to shore up Europe's postwar economic miracle. In smoky coffeehouses in Rotterdam and Copenhagen, makeshift prayer halls in Hamburg and Brussels, Islamic bookstalls in Birmingham and ""Londonistan,"" and the prisons of Madrid, Milan, and Marseilles, immigrants or their descendants are volunteering for jihad against the West

The mass immigration of Muslims to Europe was an unintended consequence of post-World War II guest-worker programs. Backed by friendly politicians and sympathetic judges, foreign workers, who were supposed to stay temporarily, benefited from family reunification programs and became permanent. Successive waves of immigrants formed a sea of descendants. Today, Muslims constitute the majority of immigrants in most western European countries, including Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, and the largest single component of the immigrant population in the United Kingdom. Exact numbers are hard to come by because Western censuses rarely ask respondents about their faith. But it is estimated that between 15 and 20 million Muslims now call Europe home and make up four to five percent of its total population. (Muslims in the United States probably do not exceed 3 million, accounting for less than two percent of the total population.) France has the largest proportion of Muslims (seven to ten percent of its total population), followed by the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Given continued immigration and high Muslim fertility rates, the National Intelligence Council projects that Europe's Muslim population will double by 2025.

Unlike their U.S. counterparts, who entered a gigantic country built on immigration, most Muslim newcomers to western Europe started arriving only after World War II, crowding into small, culturally homogenous nations. Their influx was a new phenomenon for many host states and often unwelcome. Meanwhile, North African immigrants retained powerful attachments to their native cultures. So unlike American Muslims, who are geographically diffuse, ethnically fragmented, and generally well off, Europe's Muslims gather in bleak enclaves with their compatriots: Algerians in France, Moroccans in Spain, Turks in Germany, and Pakistanis in the United Kingdom.
http://www.cfr.org/religion/europes-angry-muslims/p8218

Egalité makes France officially color-blind: the government is not allowed to count, let alone consider, whether individuals belong to a racial, ethnic, or religious minority. And yet, the reality is that the Algerian workers who were encouraged to come to France in the nineteen-forties and fifties were placed in temporary housing on the periphery of France's cities, and these geographically segregated banlieues are where later immigrants have continued to live. Numerous studies show that job applicants with such addresses or with ""foreign"" names are much more likely to be rejected out of hand, regardless of their professional qualifications. Many in France continue to consider as immigrants people of North African or African descent whose families have lived in the country for generations, and who are French citizens. Fifty-five per cent consider Muslims to be a ""group apart,"" and twenty-six per cent still consider Jews to be a ""group apart,"" surprising given that Jewish immigration is very old and highly assimilated.

 But this is also a country where the black justice minister Christiane Taubira is welcomed by a child with the words ""Hey, guenon [monkey], go and eat bananas!"" 

The 12-year-old girl who uttered those words in the town of Angers on October 25 had come with her parents to protest against the same-sex marriage law of which the minister has become a symbol. In the crowd of protesters were a dozen children shouting the word guenon; their parents looked pleased, proud even.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/774522939295166/?type=3,2015-01-09 15:44:23,11,4,7,11,0,0,0,0,0

They aspire for the days of the ""AMERICAN"" the ""big guy"" and they don't always have to agree with him/her.  

Their (Joe and Sally's) needs and wants are the very antithesis of the needs and wants of the Chamber of Commerce.  Certainly their lives  are touched by positive results of the Chamber of Commerce, but  deep down in their gut they don't trust these characters that are promoted by this group because somehow they just don't view those candidates as ""one of them"".  They think that there is an ""angle"" to whatever ""Candidate Moderate"" says.

If this were not true, we would be in President McCain's last two years in office or mid-way through the first term of President Romney.  One can argue that we would be better off with President Romney but ""if wishes were horses we would all ride"".

For as much as we want to believe that people are thinking about ""the issues"", Americans want to ""identify"" with their leaders…..  To ""look up"" to their leaders……. To be curious about their leader's lives – and yes this does matter – the family is elected not just the candidate.  They want to see a life overcoming adversity, because this is the American way…..  and they don't even mind a blemish or two.  Because world issues, economic indicators, domestic terrorism, the racial stuff, the gender stuff and the international strife, ….. and all the rest…… are things they want ""their leader"" to handle…..  and if he/she has had what is perceived to be a ""charmed"" life…..  they don't  consider him/her ""up to the challenge"".    And guess what?  Joe and Sally don't have time to do these things themselves … so they want someone who they perceive can do it.

Anyways….. This is just the view from earth… where I reside.  I am the average middle income voter, two kids a mortgage and a job.  Two kids in school, one in college, two dogs two cars, belonging to a health club for $34.00 per month and not a country club.  Commuting 52 miles each day to work…..  Average…  just like 100 million others in the nation.  These are the  actual voters.

Note:  Every other time Republicans have nominated an unapologetic and firm conservative – 1924, 1980, and 1984 – this conservative Republican won by an enormous landslide.  Coolidge in 1924, in fact, won by a wider margin over his Democrat opponent than any presidential candidate in the last ninety years – wider than FDR in 1936 or LBJ in 1964 or Nixon in 1972 or Reagan in 1984.

428053320608798_772777616136365,"Good Wednesday Morning!

The Religion of Peace speaks:  """"We have avenged the prophet.""

They were armed with Kalashnikov rifles and are also thought to have had a rocket-propelled grenade during the attack on Wednesday morning.

The attackers are believed to have called out their victims by name before shooting them. In one video clip, one of them is heard to shout: ""We have avenged the prophet.""

You might now ask……..   ""How did they avenge their prophet?""  ….   Will tell you how:

Heavily armed gunmen shouting Islamist slogans stormed a Paris satirical newspaper office Wednesday and shot dead at least 12 people in the deadliest attack in France in four decades.
http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ten-dead-in-shooting-at-french-satirical-weekly/ar-AA7Spbm

A spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor said the editor and a cartoonist for the satirical newspaper, who went by the pen names Charb and Cabu, were among those killed.

In an interview a couple of years ago, the cartoonists said the following:""When we attack the Catholic hard right ... nobody talks about it in the papers. It's as if Charlie Hebdo has official authorization to attack the Catholic hard right. But we are not allowed to make fun of Muslim hardliners. It's the new rule ... but we will not obey it,"" he said in 2012..

So, it is OK to poke fun at anyone else or any other religion, but don't touch the ""religion of peace"" or you might find yourself literally in pieces.... a little here and a little there.

Radio France chief executive Mathieu Gilet announced on Twitter that a contributor, Bernard Maris, was another of the victims.
Two police officers were also among the dead, including one assigned as Charb's bodyguard after death threats were made against him.

Another 20 people have also been injured, at least four seriously. Reports said ambulances were still arriving at the scene of the shooting at 5pm local time.

Footage showed police officer officers helping distressed people away from the scene of the shooting.

After the attack, the gunmen returned to their black Citroen getaway car and shouted: ""We have avenged the Prophet Mohammed, we have killed Charlie Hebdo.""

The vehicle was later found abandoned, and is being examined by forensics teams.

A police official said the gunmen fled towards the eastern Paris suburbs after carjacking another vehicle.

Oh……. They  (the ""avengers"") also screamed ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest) after the death and destruction they left.  Last year beheadings, this year begins literally with a ""bang""……  

I guess, just as ""beauty"", ""peace"" is in the eye of the beholder…..so..... let's not "" lose our heads"" about this.... at least not yet.l",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/772777302803063/?type=3,2015-01-07 12:15:48,29,8,24,29,0,0,0,0,0

Shooting Cops in NYC.

""Thank God these officers are doing well and will recover,"" Mayor de Blasio said at the hospital, where officers packed the hallways.

Two plainclothes NYPD officers responding to a robbery  at a commercial business in the Fordham section of the Bronx  Monday night  were shot and wounded in a gunfight with two male suspects who then escaped, officials said.

The officers, one 30 and the other 38, both with at least six years on the job, suffered nonlife-threatening injuries, police said. They were being treated Tuesday morning at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. Police did not identify either officer because officials were still notifying family.

The 30-year-old officer suffered gunshots to the left arm and the lower back, Commissioner William Bratton said  at about 2 a.m. Tuesday during a joint news conference with Mayor Bill de Blasio.  The officer is listed in critical but stable condition, Bratton said.  The 38-year-old officer was shot in the chest and left arm and is in stable condition, Bratton said.

The shooting came two weeks after two NYPD officers were fatally wounded Dec. 20 in Brooklyn. Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were shot and killed as they sat in their police vehicle on a Brooklyn street by a gunman who had expressed anti-police sentiments. The shooter then fled the scene and took his own life.
The latest shooting comes at a time when relations between officers and the mayor are strained, as well as relations between city residents and the police.

The organization COP SHOT, Citizens Outraged at Police Being Shot, has offered a $10,000 reward leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspects.

Joseph Dossi said his police officer son, Andrew Dossi, of suburban Stony Point, is not married but has a 8-year-old daughter. Gail Dossi was at her son's side at the hospital.

""He's a patriotic type of guy,"" Joseph Dossi said. ""Besides the Army, he was airborne, jumping and rappelling out of a helicopter. He came up through the ranks.""

Wishing both officers a speedy recovery and hope the perpetrator (s) caught and brought to justice.",Photos from The Republican Coffee Corner with Angela's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/771404836273643/?type=3,2015-01-06 13:30:45,66,10,17,66,0,0,0,0,0

428053320608798_770864356327691,"Andy Warhol August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American artist who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture and advertisement that flourished by the 1960s. After a successful career as a commercial illustrator, Warhol became a renowned and sometimes controversial artist. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native city, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives. It is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist.

Warhol's art used many types of media, including hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film, and music. He was also a pioneer in computer-generated art using Amiga computers that were introduced in 1984, two years before his death. He founded Interview Magazine and was the author of numerous books, including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and Popism: The Warhol Sixties. He managed and produced the Velvet Underground, a rock band which had a strong influence on the evolution of punk rock music. He is also notable as a gay man who lived openly as such before the gay liberation movement. His studio, The Factory, was a famous gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanCoffeeCornerWithAngela/photos/a.428099907270806.98526.428053320608798/770864356327691/?type=3,2015-01-05 21:46:37,13,0,1,13,0,0,0,0,0

Give Him A Chance....... Show some respect.....

Glad to be back!  Over the past two weeks there have been so many things to write about but I have been so busy with life in general  l and the end of the fiscal year, however, this story caught my eye and heart:

Dario Raschio ""joined the Navy at the age of 27. He piloted observational planes, and was based on the USS Chester. He participated in five campaigns in the Pacific Theatre.
 
One harrowing incident took place on Easter Sunday in 1944. He had been on a mission and took gunfire. When returning to the ship, his plane went down in the ocean and he figured that he and his passenger were likely to die in the water. A Navy destroyer came along a few hours later and rescued the pair, just as sharks were beginning to circle.
 
He then revealed the location of an ammo dump they had viewed from the sky on a South Pacific island. The dump was destroyed.
 
On Saturday, Raschio glossed over the incident. He seemed more concerned by the immediate action he was witnessing. As he grabbed the mic to speak, more shouts came from the back of the room, demanding the military exit from Iraq.
 
The feisty gentleman who has attained the age of 100 ""responded, ""Give me a chance"" which brought chuckles from the audience. He further chastised the shouters, saying ""Let's show a little respect for this occasion,"" to which the crowd applauded.
 
He accepted the medals on behalf of those who died in WWII and ended his short speech by saying, ""God bless America. And you people that are here for a cause, whatever it might be—show respect""  

The crowd, you see , felt that they were exercising their First Amendment rights by interrupting everyone else's First Amendment rights.  They (the crowd) started by chanting the fabled ""Hand's up! Don't shoot"" and then ""let's leave Iraq""..........  Unfortunately, the protestors  don't read the newspapers...... Michael Brown never said the words ""Hands Up! Don't shoot!"" and we ARE leaving Iraq...... albeit in shambles.

They, the protestors..... that is, managed to shut down the ceremony....That will be their achievement.  At 3:15, after waiting 45 minutes the meeting to begin, organizers called it off.  The squeaky wheel got the grease and the gentleman got the shaft.

But in the end, Dario Raschio.......  navy war veteran and hero......you are an honorable man, congratulations.
