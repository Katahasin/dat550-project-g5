The Progressive magazine published its first issue on January 9, 1909 as LaFollette's Weekly.  108 years later, we are still fighting for the same values. 
 
We stand against militarism and the concentration of power in corporate hands. We champion peace and the empowerment of the citizenry, social and economic justice, civil liberties, human rights, a preserved environment, and a reinvigorated democracy.
 
The Progressive is more important than ever before. Our nation, and our movement, face grave challenges.The Progressive publishes voices of dissent and those under-represented in mainstream media.  Our goal has always been to champion grassroots progressive politics.
 
We move forward into 2017 continuing to cover, both in print and online, the voices of people and movements seeking to build a better world.

""I think gayness is about pleasure and pursuing pleasure. And that can be hedonistic, in the sense of pleasure for pleasure's sake. Or it can be moral, in the sense that it's eros, which has a moral dimension. Our relationships extend the definition of family. They don't undermine it or threaten it; they actually broaden it and bolster it beyond bloodlines. Family has always been tied to blood. I think, because of the whole inheritance thing, the need to protect private property. And so gayness comes along and redefines family beyond this economic realm of inheritance and blood into this other emotional and commitment and responsibility realm. 

""I have a gay and lesbian family of friends—straight friends, gay friends, their kids—that to me is as important and strong and part of me as my sisters and their kids and brothers in-law. The friendship circles that two people bring into each others' lives are probably more important than their so-called family. Gayness defines friends as family. And it also has a very community-minded definition of family. Gay people have a strong sense of responsibility to community that comes out of having to create institutions to take care of our own, but which is exactly the sense of civic community and civic responsibility that many straight people are bemoaning as being lost.

""We have to change values, change cultural institutions, change economic forces to have a society in which gay people are viewed as equal, normal, healthy, natural human beings. I'm not part of a civil rights movement. I'm part of a liberation movement.""

The Air of the Free

TV, computers, and the Internet
Democratize our sins, so that
The smallest child may have a dirty mind,
And this is progress for our kind,
Enriching those who most deserve to be
Enriched, leaving in poverty
The ones who're most deserving to be poor.
This way our art and literature
Serve our God-given freedom to express
Ourselves however we think best
And be as uninhibited as hogs,
Our electronic catalogs
Conveying all our everlasting hopes
While we glide down the frozen slopes
Of the statistical analysis
And the opinion poll. Let this
Be a sign unto us: the plug, once plugged,
Cannot forever be unplugged.
When shocked by our electrifying diet
Of filth, inanity, and riot,
Official violence and family quarrels,
We pray to government to save our morals.",,status,,2015-08-05 15:50:00,17,0,2,17,0,0,0,0,0
