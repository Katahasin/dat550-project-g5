About the event:
 
""States' Rights!"" has long been the rallying cry of reaction. But ""limited government"" has not been a political principle so much as the defensive tactic of a political minority.

So long as the right is able to wield the power of the US state to its own ends, it is more than happy to do so. That seems terrifyingly true today as President-Elect Trump awaits inauguration. The more so because it is far from a new approach.

""Relative to its free population, the South held disproportionate influence in virtually every branch of the antebellum US government...

They sought with terrific ambition to command the power of the entire United States... nowhere did slaveholders wield their power with more energy or commitment than in the realm of foreign and military policy...

The master theorists of the master class did not demand rigid or slavish obedience to the principle of local sovereignty. Rather, they sought to consolidate proslavery forces for a larger struggle that spanned the Atlantic world.""

—from ""This Vast Southern Empire""

About the speakers:

Matt Karp is Assistant Professor of History at Princeton University and a contributing editor at Jacobin. ""This Vast Southern Empire"" is his first book.

Eric Foner has, over the course of a fifty-year career, acquired virtually every award, tribute, and professional honor available to a historian in the United States. Foner's most important books have transformed the way we see — and the way we teach — the origins of the Civil War, the significance of slave emancipation, and the politics of postwar Reconstruction. These books include Reconstruction, The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery, and many others. No living historian has done more to shape our understanding of the American Civil War era than Eric Foner.",This Vast Southern Empire with Matt Karp and Eric Foner,event,https://www.facebook.com/events/1348427925168354/,2016-11-15 12:50:16,35,4,0,34,0,0,0,0,1

Join Jacobin and Verso Books books for the official launch of George Ciccariello-Maher's Building the Commune: Radical Democracy in Venezuela. 

Since 2011, a wave of popular mobilizations has swept the globe, from Occupy to the Arab Spring, 15M in Spain and the uprisings in Greece. Their demands were varied, but what they share is a commitment to ideals of radical democracy, and a willingness to experiment with new forms of organization to achieve this. In fact, the countries of Latin America have been experimenting with such projects since 1989—just as left projects of all stripes fell into decline across Europe—in what was a moment of rebirth. Poor residents of Venezuela's barrios took history into their own hands in a mass popular rebellion against neoliberalism, much as the movements appearing worldwide are doing today.

In Building the Commune, George Ciccariello-Maher travels through the many radical experiments of Venezuela, assessing how they have succeeded and failed, and how they are continuing to operate. Speaking to community members, workers, students and government officials, Ciccariello-Maher provides a balance sheet of these projects, that movements throughout the world can look to for lessons and inspiration.

Building the Commune is part of Verso's Jacobin series, featuring short interrogations of politics, economics, and culture from a socialist perspective. The books offer critical analysis and engagement with the history and ideas of the Left in an accessible format.

""In the aftermath of last week's referendum, our country faces major challenges. Risks to the economy and living standards are growing. The public is divided.

The Government is in disarray. Ministers have made it clear they have no exit plan, but are determined to make working people pay with a new round of cuts and tax rises.

Labour has the responsibility to give a lead where the Government will not. We need to bring people together, hold the Government to account, oppose austerity and set out a path to exit that will protect jobs and incomes.

To do that we need to stand together. Since I was elected leader of our party nine months ago, we have repeatedly defeated the Government over its attacks on living standards.

Last month, Labour become the largest party in the local elections. In Thursday's referendum, a narrow majority voted to leave, but two thirds of Labour supporters backed our call for a remain vote.

I was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60% of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning. Today's vote by MPs has no constitutional legitimacy.

We are a democratic party, with a clear constitution. Our people need Labour Party members, trade unionists and MPs to unite behind my leadership at a critical time for our country.""",,status,,2016-06-28 12:00:00,1798,46,240,1691,98,1,4,2,2
