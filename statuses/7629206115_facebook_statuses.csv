*Have professional sports helped break down race barriers, or helped the wealthy, white elite to profit by exploiting people of color? 
*How do athletes perpetuate gender stereotypes or challenge them?
*What is the future of sports in a world with a disappearing middle class, a growing awareness that all lives matter, and a shifting gender consciousness? 
*How can sports promote a social justice agenda? 

Come prepared to share your love of the game--and to ask the tough questions, together with journalist, UW lecturer, and host of the evening, Caley Cook.
 
This event is brought to you by the UW Department of Communication and co-sponsored by the UW Center for Human Rights as part of The Nation's 150th anniversary event tour.

The Nation's publisher and editor, Katrina vanden Heuvel, Divest Harvard's founder, Chloe Maxmin, and The Nation's London correspondent, D.D. Guttenplan, will discuss Guttenplan's long-awaited book, The Nation: A Biography. 

The book chronicles the surprising story behind America's oldest weekly magazine—the bickering abolitionists who founded it; the campaigns, causes and controversies that shaped it; the rebels, mavericks and visionaries who have written, edited and fought in its pages for 150 years—and counting.

Tickets are just $5. Book sales and signing will follow.

The year 2015 marks the 150th anniversary of The Nation Magazine. Join a conversation about The Nation's and the nation's past, present and future with Katrina vanden Heuvel, D.D. Guttenplan, Khalil Muhammad and Bob Herbert. Moderated by Laura Flanders.

Special comments from Mychal Denzel Smith, Sarah Leonard and Michelle Chen plus audience questions will follow the initial conversation.

The event is free of charge, but we expect to reach capacity. Please use this link to reserve your seat: https://americashiddenhistorynyc.eventbrite.com

Book sales and signing will follow the program. 

The story of The Nation is also the story of our country.  For the past 150 years, America's hidden history—of domestic oppression and overseas conquest, but also of opposition and resistance—has been recorded in the magazine's pages.  

Over the decades that opposition has had many names from the patrician reformers of the 1860s through a vast array of political and economic struggles to more recent fights against corporate globalization, free trade, economic inequality the destruction of the environment and police brutality.
