44951363957_653608178164408,"With the overall employment rate for prime-working-age Americans still well below its year 2000 peak, policymakers are looking for reforms that could increase work, including reforms to safety net programs. Recent changes to disability and means-tested assistance programs in the UK offer one example of work-focused reforms that some analysts point to as a model. What were those reforms, and were they successful? Should the US pursue a similar course?

Join AEI as Iain Duncan Smith MP, one of the chief architects of welfare reform in the UK, analyzes those reforms and their relevance for US policy.

Two new Pew Research Center surveys provide nonpartisan data on Americans' views of and experiences with family and medical leave. One dives into Americans' evaluations of different paid leave policy proposals and the impact on families, the economy, employers, and employees. The second surveys US adults who have taken — or needed but were unable to take — leave in the past two years, examining how they navigated these situations and how they coped with the loss of income if they did not receive full pay. Following the presentation of the report, an expert panel will discuss the findings, featuring AEI scholar Aparna Mathur.

Poland, a nation that successfully transitioned into a market-based democracy in the 1990s, is the eighth-largest economy in the EU. Although relatively strong economically, it is by no means immune to continent-wide challenges, such as the recent financial crisis, the influx of refugees, persistently sluggish economic growth, democratic backsliding, and Moscow's encouragement of a swelling populist revolt. How will Poland's leading Law and Justice Party help the country deal with these realities? For today's leaders in Poland, what potential role does the nation's long-standing partnership with the United States play in that process?

Following a tumultuous election cycle, the new Trump administration faces a host of policy challenges that hearken to another historic presidential transition. As he prepared to leave office in 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower emphasized the need for strong executive leadership in confronting challenges posed by bitter partisanship, nuclear proliferation, and a contentious relationship with Russia. Five decades later, the United States faces a renewed debate on how to best address these same issues.

Without reliable information about the economic and social environment, making sensible choices that produce positive outcomes in commerce, research, and governance is impossible. Although the federal government's statistical agencies play a vital role in generating this information, their value is often overlooked.

On March 2, the Hamilton Project at Brookings and the American Enterprise Institute will convene a policy luncheon discussion, highlighting the important role of government statistics. The forum will begin with remarks from Arthur Brooks and Robert E. Rubin. Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach will present on the value of government statistical agencies, followed by a roundtable discussion with Rebecca Blank, Martin S. Feldstein, Ellen Davis, Torsten Slok, and David Leonhardt. In conjunction with this event, the Hamilton Project and AEI will release a set of economic facts on the importance of government-collected statistical data.

Black men in the United States are struggling on many fronts. Their employment rates have fallen dramatically since 2000, and large racial gaps in educational attainment, family stability, and incarceration persist. Yet at the same time, black men have shaped mainstream popular culture in powerful ways.

What role have economic factors played in this struggle? How do the complex subcultures that black men navigate affect these issues? And in what ways can public policy and cultural attitudes be engaged to improve the prospects of black men?
