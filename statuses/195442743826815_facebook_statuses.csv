Second, it's like they just pretend that election law can be changed by fiat instead of set by each state...and the primaries are controlled by the PARTIES in each state, and that's just how it is. Until a federal election law is passed, hashed out in the courts and ""forced down the throats"" of the states (this argument will be made mostly by the states that joined the confederacy and the ones in the libertarian west, where cows outnumber people, a frontier mentality prevails, and the federal government owns wide swaths of land) the election laws and rules will continue to be set by the states and the parties.

Two things I take issue with here:

First, It is an article of faith among the GOP base that ""Reaganomics,"" like conservatism, can never fail, it can only *be* failed, but don't take my word for it, ask your Republican uncle.

Second, those of us who are ""older"" and ""more established"" white collar types busted our humps playing a rigged game for thirty years to get what we have, in spite of the fact that our boats never floated, and we realize incremental tweaks are the only way we get to an outcome we want rather than one we regret for decades.

An interesting aside about snap polls that yours truly was tangentially involved in. During the campaign for Senate in Missouri in 2006, a rumor started floating around that Jim Talent wasn't attending Senate Armed Services Committee meetings. It remained a rumor until one blogger waded through all the transcripts of every SASC meeting since Talent had been on it and discovered he was either absent or asleep and not participating 67% of the time, and we were in two shooting wars. That blogger -- okay, it was me -- called his office and followed up by email, asking if the tale of the transcripts was true, and got totally blown off, not even a ""no comment."" So what is a blogger with that sort of information to do? Contact the McCaskill campaign (that was somewhat in disarray after a key staffer died in a plane crash during the campaign) and give them the information. Claire hit him with it in a debate, he looked like a deer in the headlights, McCaskill pulled ahead in the overnights, and he never caught up. His base of support -- rural conservatives -- sends more kids off to the military than the average, and those folks didn't appreciate him abdicating his responsibility to their sons and daughters who were fighting two shooting wars at the time. Without the snap-polls that verified that Talent had lost the faith of the electorate, pundits and incumbency would have helped him prevail.  --BG",Debates Need Snap Polls to Hold Pundits Accountable,link,http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2015_10/debates_need_snap_polls_to_hol058166.php,2015-10-18 09:21:16,7,0,1,7,0,0,0,0,0

Fortunately, President Obama nor anyone in the Democratic field is jumping on the panic bandwagon, instead they are addressing aspirations instead of fears, and after 14 years of being told to go shopping and seal our windows with plastic sheeting and duct tape and other fear-mongering by the right-wing, Obama's message of hope and change isn't stale.

Then, about two weeks later, I started to see some of them...the free clinic where I volunteered a shift or two a week used the same protocols to process them as we used to process refugees from Somalia, The Sudan or Bosnia. Then, about five months later, at my real job in a suburban hospital where half the business was delivering babies, I started seeing a lot of familiar names in the Blood Bank that ended with ""eaux.""  Invariably, when I went upstairs to congratulate them on the birth of a healthy baby, they remembered me not as the person who had stuck them with a needle when they first arrived in Kansas City, but as one of the first friendly white faces they had seen in weeks.

We talk a lot more about community and social responsibility and justice than we do the supernatural aspects of Catholicism...like how the Catholic church was the only organization that stood up to the right-wing death squads and fascist regimes in Central America in the late 70s and 80s. Bertrand Russell was wrong about one thing: The Priest doesn't always side with the dictator, not if he's preaching Liberation Theology -- which is still an unspeakable phrase. Archbishop Romero was assassinated on the altar as he said mass and he was a Jesuit. He was beatified a few weeks ago, and in none of the articles about his beatification, either in English or Spanish, was it acknowledged that he preached Liberation Theology.
