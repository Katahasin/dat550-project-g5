Maher is vocal on this hypocrisy and he is 100% right. And (2) His opposition to the easily offended, liberal, thought-police who are outraged at every little word or action they disagree with. Maher reckons that is a big part of why they keep losing elections and I agree. Question for you - when the thought police try and shut you up, what do you do? Do you shut up? The natural reaction of most people is to rebel when someone attempts to strip their freedom from them. I actually think many people voted for Trump simply because he was the first candidate to give the bird to the PC police. No other reason. It was just a case of ""Thank God this man stands his ground against the liberal lynch mob. He's got my vote."" Maher is right in saying that trying to silence people is a huge weakness on the Left and one that is costing them elections. A differing view is not 'hatred' - it's just a different view.

She has, for her entire career, served and employed people who identify as homosexual. She has loved them, and cared for them, and never said a mean word to any of them. One of her friends, who she had made her best flower arrangements for over the years, was a homosexual. When he came to her to ask if she could participate in his gay wedding by supplying the flowers, she sadly said no - she couldn't be a part of an event that goes against her conscience and her religious beliefs. She told him she would always do his flowers for him for any other occasion - she just couldn't do the wedding. At the age of 71, she is now being sued by the State of Washington and under threat of being wiped out financially for not wanting to take part in the wedding because it goes against her conscience. It is important to note that she has never discriminated against homosexuals in her life. Her decision was all about the EVENT, not the PEOPLE. Is it right that we be forced to participate in events that go against our conscience? Can you imagine any event that you wouldn't want to be a part of? Would you like to be forced by the State?

It's wrong, it made me angry, and it's indefensible. So is putting men into bathrooms with little girls, encouraging transgenderism on any child who displays signs of playing with the other gender's toys, Bill Clinton using that cigar on one of his interns and then lying about it on national TV, JFK's numerous affairs, (including having sex with a teenager in the White House and famously saying he gets a headache if he 'doesn't do it every day'), Hillary saying 'What difference does it make?' when asked about the four young men murdered in Benghazi, Hillary defending a child rapist and laughing when she managed to get him off, and Hillary's support of late-term dismemberment abortions up until the baby is 9 months old in the womb... My point is not in defense of Trump. It is to highlight the fact that 'moral outrage' is only employed on the Left when it suits their purposes. Every other day, they're quick to say that there is no objective morality, morality is 'subjective' and people must do what they want in private without any judgment! Now that it suits their purposes (to get Hillary into the White House and have her elect 4 liberal Supreme Court justices), they are suddenly claiming that there ARE objective standards, that Trump's actions are wrong and they're judging him- Hmmmm... Those of us who believe in objective truth and objective morality need to be FIRST to say Trump was wrong WHILE AT THE SAME TIME calling out the hypocrisy of those who are outraged with Trump today, but on every other day claim that there is no objective morality and 'TO EACH THEIR OWN.' You can't pick up objective truth and morality for a day when it suits you, then drop it tomorrow and go back to 'A person's private life is private' and 'As long as it makes you happy!!' If you're upset about what Trump said in private (like I am) just quietly admit to yourself that there IS an objective right and an objective wrong, there is objective truth, there is objective morality, and it's NOT WRONG to judge the actions of others. Because judging is exactly what you're doing with Trump -and it's fine. Judge away.

1061277377271291_1187025121363182,"1) It is a long-standing policy of the US to never pay ransom to terorrists.
2) The logic behind that policy is that when terrorists know that countries pay, that makes them far more likely to take hostages. So ransom payments lead to future kidnappings, and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments - which endangers Americans by making it lucrative to kidnap them and grows the capacity of terrorist organizations to conduct attacks.
3) Iran is a regime known to fund terrorism and shouts of 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel' have been heard there on more than one occasion. Their Ayatollah Khomeini has even said that 'Americans are the great Satan, the wounded snake.'
4) In January of this year, Iran surprisingly agreed to free 4 American prisoners that they had been holding, including Pastor Saeed. It was seen as a diplomatic breakthrough at the time, with Obama taking credit.
5) It has come to light that at the SAME TIME that those prisoners were freed, Obama instructed that $400M in umarked cash bills be flown into Iran on a cargo plane. 
6) The payment was kept secret and was not revealed to the public at the time.
7) Now that it has come to light in a report, Obama can't deny that he did it, and is doing everything short of cartwheels to tell everyone that there is nothing to see here and that it was just a first payment on the $1.7Billion that was to be paid to Iran in terms of the (disastrous) Iran deal that his administration brokered - not explaining why it was done with unmarked bills on a cargo plane.
8) Meanwhile, Pastor Saeed has confirmed to the press that despite the fact that his plane and pilot were ready to leave, he had to wait the whole night at the airport, and when he asked the Iranian police about the delay, they told him that they were waiting for a plane to arrive and could not release him until it arrived.
9) Furthermore, according to the Wall Street Journal, the Iranian Press has quoted senior Iranian defense officials describing the cash as a ransom payment. So in Iran, it's being called RANSOM.
10) To recap - Unmarked bills? Ordered by Obama and sent in secretly by a cargo plane? At the same time the hostages were released? And one of the hostages was told that he couldn't be released until the plane arrived? What do they say about 'if it quacks like a duck...' Iranian officials are calling it ransom. And if it was, that makes Obama the first US president in history to endanger US citizens by letting a terrorist regime know that the US will pay to have them released. It amounts to a complete upheaval of an old, foundational policy and core principle in how the US deals with kidnapping and terrorism, and makes US citizens very valuable to terrorist regimes. The release of this report breaking the story this week, is not a small thing.

""There is a war on. It's a cultural war. It's not something you'll hear in the mainstream, because most journalists are idiots. Most journalists don't understand where the real battlegrounds are. The founder of the site that I work for, Andrew Breitbart, understood instinctively that POLITICS WAS DOWNSTREAM FROM CULTURE. He understood that by the time you're talking about policy and free trade, you've already lost the war. BECAUSE THE WAR TAKES PLACE IN THE CULTURE - for the academia, for the entertainment industry, and for the news. These are institutions in America, (supposedly the most free country in the world) that have been completely occupied by the Political Left. Now for a while, that was okay for us. For a while, the Left had our backs. That is no longer the case. You've heard from the speaker before me who can speak with more authority than I ever could about the risk from Jihad and Radical Islam.  Democrat politicians in this country are welcoming in a religion that wants us dead. They are welcoming movements and belief systems that are completely incompatible with a western way of life – with modern, Western, Capitalist, Liberal Democracies – the only systems under which gay people are happy and have rights. The only system under which WOMEN are happy and have rights! This is the only system that works. And if the Left wants to turn New York into Raqqa, it's got a fight on its hands, because they're going to have to go up against the gays first. I am not the only person dedicated to the destruction of Leftist media in this country. I am not the only person that recognises that after a few decades of good leadership, these people have now thrown us under the bus. Although I am just a Brit, with slightly over-bleached hair, I have come here to give you a warning from Europe. In Europe, we have seen the consequences of letting Western Culture go – that culture that protects us and holds us precious – we have seen the consequences of letting that go. I'm speaking up because somebody has to. I am doing this because the Liberal Media have decided that other people rank higher than we do in importance. I can't understand why they have decided to molly coddle and pander to an ideology that wants me dead. I think if we're over the age of 25, we do bear some responsibility for the bad situation we now find ourselves in. Because we believed the Left when they lied to us. We believed them when they said they had our back. We believed them when they said that Republicans were racist, sexist and mysoginist, homophobic and transphobic. That was a lie. What they were trying to do is control you by labelling you, and now they are trying to shut down free speech. They've done it with me, and they will come for you too. Make no mistake about it. You are all next. If you're the wrong group, with the wrong beliefs, the Left will come for you. What gay people have to understand is that it was us - it was we - it was this big group standing here who gave the Left their power. We enabled them. We colonized Hollywood and we gave them power. But what we have given, we can take away. And it's time for us to take it away.""",,status,,2016-07-22 08:21:49,78,6,20,69,5,4,0,0,0

""I am surprised and saddened at the public outcry around that poor mom whose toddler ended up in the gorilla's enclosure. Here are my quick thoughts:
1) Any mother of young children knows that you can look away for a second and something bad can happen. An accident takes a moment and it can happen to even the best and most attentive mothers. Accidents happen.
2) If it were my baby being dragged around under water by a gorilla, I wouldn't blink before saying 'Shoot!""... I wouldn't wonder... or weigh it up... or seek advice. I would grab the gun and do it myself if I had to.
3) It is sad that the gorilla was killed, but the zoo-keeper made the best and only decision he could've made. Thank God the headline was 'Gorilla killed' and not 'Baby torn to pieces as parents watched.' Those who are angry with the outcome must genuinely ask themselves which headline they prefer - because even animal activists are saying that it was going to be one or the other.
4) For now, until further information comes to light, I am firmly in the mom's corner. I can't imagine the trauma she has been through and I hope she knows that there are MANY moms who are empathising with her, and not sitting in self-righteous judgement - smugly telling themselves that 'no accident would ever happen on their watch'.

Dear Target, thank you for being so ""inclusive"" as to allow men who identify as women to use the rest room with women who identify as women. Some people believe safety, privacy, dignity, and reality are more important considerations than political correctness, but it's wonderful to see you taking a stand against those bigots. Why should our wives and daughters be treated with decency when there are cross dressing dudes to appease? Again, thank you for your bravery.

Now, since we are in an era of acceptance and tolerance, I feel comfortable revealing that I have, for quite some time now, self-identified as a South American spider monkey. As a member of the spider monkey community, I prefer to use the bathroom anywhere. This could include the men's bathroom, the women's bathroom, the parking lot, aisle 12, the conveyor belt at the cash register, etc. This is what makes me most comfortable. The fact that it makes everyone else decidedly less comfortable is not my concern. This is all about me. Everything revolves around me and my feelings, you understand.

I will need you to place signs throughout the store indicating that trans-creature Americans may relieve themselves in whatever place and whatever manner best fits their species preference. Of course I'm also going to need you to abolish the narrow-minded, discriminatory, speciesphobic store policy that prohibits non-human mammals from even entering the premises to begin with. This is the year 2016, Target. Those kinds of policies belong back in the days of Jim Crow. Not to be confused with my friend Jim the Crow, who identifies as a crow, and therefore might be found in your parking lot picking through your garbage and defecating on the cars. The only appropriate response to this behavior is applause.

It's nice that you have begun the process of abandoning reality in favor of the confusions and fetishes of severely disturbed people, but I must insist that you complete this evolution promptly. Spider monkeys do not deserve to be left out.

I am an oppressed minority, and anyone who refuses to bend to my emotional whims is a despot in the same league as Hitler.
Please correct this problem at once, and repent of your wicked ways.

Thank you.
