12641323331_10155735093478332,"""Women Killed in Yemen Raid Were Qaeda Fighters, Pentagon Says,"" was the headline on a January 30 New York Times story on the commando raid in central Yemen, the first on Donald Trump's watch. The Times says the Pentagon first denied any civilian casualties, then backtracked as evidence came in of such deaths; but that's no reason not to now quote a Pentagon spokesperson's statement:  ""We saw during this operation as it was taking place that female fighters ran to pre-established positions as though they'd been trained to be ready and trained to be combatants."" 

Whether they were ""female fighters"" *before* they ran to to these ""pre-established"" positions, or *because* they did, is neither asked nor answered, but the spokesperson does get to wink -- to the paper's millions of readers -- ""Take reports of female casualties with a grain of salt."" 

No such caveat attaches to the claim that the raid yielded ""valuable...materials"" that will ""help prevent terror attacks."" The paper notes the spokesperson ""did not provide details,"" where another might say what was missing was proof.   

So while Trump's Yemen raid is being called tactically flawed, the near-bottomless credulity with which elite media accept the official line on US actions in Yemen would seem unchanged.

If one only skims headlines, one might be left believing the now-debunked story that Trump is responsible for creating jobs at mobile phone carrier Sprint, that Mexico has agreed to pay for a wall that Trump made central to his campaign, and, well, that Trump is right about something.

Treating everything the president says as newsworthy in itself is a longstanding custom, but it reaches new levels of absurdity when he's known as a habitual liar.

""When you get down to it, to attribute voters' choices to irrational resentments is to put them beyond the reach of rational persuasion—in other words, to give up on them.

""To do the opposite—to refuse to concede working-class voters to the right wing—does not mean ignoring the role of white nationalism in Trump's victory.Racism and xenophobia are key ideologies in Trump's coalition, which disproportionately attracts believers in racial superiority.
 
""Finding racial and cultural enemies is the natural tendency of far-right movements that gain strength from economic dislocation. They will likely continue to grow without a strong counter-argument from the left that solidarity and not scapegoating is the solution to workers' problems. Only if we see economic stratification and racial resentment as interrelated—rather than presenting them, as Krugman does, as mutually exclusive explanations—do we have a viable strategy for dealing with either one.""","Appeal to the Working Class?

No, if we gave inner-city kids the kind of powerful critical skills and wonderful advanced curricula that I see in the good suburban high schools, for example—where the kids can take any of 20 different AP courses, including Japanese History and Culture or Russian Poetry in the 19th Century, subjects that are unimaginable in the inner-city schools— if we were giving that to all the poor kids in America, a lot of rich kids wouldn't be able to walk right into Harvard, Yale and Princeton.

That was two days after militants claiming fealty to ISIS killed 22 people in Dhaka, Bangladesh, after an 11-hour siege on a cafe. It was five days after at least 42 people were killed in Istanbul's Ataturk airport. And it was the day before three separate bomb attacks across Saudi Arabia, including one in the holy city of Medina, near a site sacred to Muslims, the mosque where the Prophet Muhammad is believed to be buried.

That Americans will have heard more about some of those attacks than others is meaningful. Not just because it's always disheartening -- and distorting -- to see some victims presented as more human than others. It's especially poignant and frustrating when the evident aims of an organization include precisely sowing enmity, division and resentment. 

But the US response to ISIS fails on levels more fundamental than a resistance to acknowledging that Muslims are its primary victims.

""Now we fall down the rabbit hole of Alice when we deal with this word 'blighted.'  It's a loaded term in modern America.  Who blighted who, you might ask.  But, nevertheless, the statute in Illinois is very elastic and has allowed such areas to be designated blighted as LaSalle Street (which is our Wall Street), the central business district of the Loop, and the booming areas proximate to the Loop.  And when a TIF is placed in such areas, it just means you're going to give free money to developers to do stuff they would have done anyway.

""There's no discussion of the fact that for almost the entirety of our nation's history, the black community and people of color in general have been the disproportionate targets of unjust surveillance.

And before that, enslaved people in our country in cities like New York, for example, literally could not walk outside after dark without carrying a lantern on them so that everyone could see them. These were called lantern laws.

And fast forward all the way to this day, and I realize I'm covering about 300 years of history in about six breaths and four sentences, but today activists with Black Lives Matter and journalists have revealed that the Department of Homeland Security, an agency founded to combat terrorism, is using its resources to monitor Black Lives Matter, even entirely peaceful activities.

He did say that the United Nations should make clear in no uncertain terms that Iraq had to comply with the UN inspectors, and the United Nations did that in UN Security Council Resolution 1441. But he never supported the idea that the United States should act unilaterally in this way.

""And yet the statement was pretty much unchallenged, including her claim that she wasn't voting for war, she was only voting for a return of the inspectors. And, in fact, she voted against the Levin amendment, introduced by the Democratic senator from Michigan, that would have authorized force if Saddam Hussein had refused to cooperate with inspectors and the UN authorized military means to enforce that. And instead she supported the Republican-sponsored resolution that essentially gave President Bush a blank check to invade Iraq at the time and circumstances of his own choosing.""",'The Sense That Everybody Thought They Had WMDs Is a Total Fantasy',link,http://fair.org/home/the-sense-that-everybody-thought-they-had-wmds-is-a-total-fantasy/,2016-03-03 21:04:07,445,28,271,412,2,2,0,4,25

    The Post's delicate approach to police killings can be appreciated by comparison with the Guardian's similar project. For one thing, the Guardian contrasts the numbers with statistics on police killings in Europe, so you can see that the rate at which US cops kill people is far out of line with the frequency of such deaths in comparable countries. For example, England and Wales had 55 fatal police shootings in the last 24 years, while the US had 59 in just 24 days. (The higher level of crime in the US explains some but not much of this difference; the US murder rate is about four times the UK's, but has a rate of police killings about 70 times as high.)",WaPo Tallies Police Killings–but Holds Back Some of the Numbers That Count,link,http://commondreams.org/views/2015/12/29/wapo-tallies-police-killings-holds-back-some-numbers-count,2015-12-30 15:10:01,77,1,20,77,0,0,0,0,0

And the Post juxtaposes these ""incidents that have ignited protests"" with categories that presumably have not and should not not inspire protest: those killed ""wielding weapons,"" who were ""suicidal or mentally troubled,"" or who ""ran when officers told them to halt.""

Actually, people very much protest these sorts of police killings, starting with Michael Brown, who ran when Darren Wilson told him to halt. Laquan McDonald, whose death at the hands of Chicago police has resulted in a first-degree murder charge for officer Jason Van Dyke and the ouster of the city's police chief, was ""wielding"" a three-inch knife when he was shot 16 times, so he would have been counted in the first category—as would Tamir Rice, since the Post made the questionable choice to count ""toy weapons"" in the same category as knives.",WaPo Tallies Police Killings–but Holds Back Some of the Numbers That Count,link,http://fair.org/home/wapo-tallies-police-killings-but-holds-back-some-of-the-numbers-that-count/,2015-12-29 11:01:22,181,11,112,181,0,0,0,0,0

Yes, Donald Trump is a crude fearmonger whose hateful statements create new divisions while reinforcing old bigotries. Yes, Trump's fellow Republicans have been too slow to call him out and too quick to adopt elements of his agenda. But Trump has also benefited from media coverage that—especially in the early stages of the campaign—was more obsessed with his celebrity than with his veracity. It fell to the watchdog group FAIR to highlight the media's failings in covering Trump and the rest of the presidential campaign. FAIR filled the void with sharp critiques of how the debates were organized (""Why Do Conservatives Get to Question Candidates—but Not Progressives?"") and vapid coverage (""Corporate Press Fails to Trump Bigotry"").

• Coverage of Russian Plane Bombing Shows What a Difference   an Enemy Makes
• It's True, Media Did Cover Beirut Bombings–About 1/40th as Much as They Covered Paris Attacks
• Once Again, Media Terrorize the Public for the Terrorists

These are just four of the many outstanding articles--the sort FAIR produces over and over again, providing the context that is needed, but missing, from corporate media coverage of important stories.

	We need your support to keep doing this. 

Last year at this time, FAIR called on our supporters to help pull us through a very scary financial time. Funding had been cut by a couple of key foundations, and we turned to the people that we count on most—our readers, our listeners and our activists.

You came through big time, and so here we are—doing the hard-hitting media analysis and research that challenges corporate media disinformation, distortions and plain old propaganda.

Our year-end fundraising drive is the single most important one of the year. It's the one that means we get to open the door in January to continue doing the work you read in Extra!, online at FAIR.org and listen to weekly on CounterSpin.

FAIR's work has never been seen by so many people, but we need you to make sure that FAIR can continue to be there to hold big media accountable.

It's part of something bigger as well; it's part of this attempt that Netanyahu has often made, and many others as well have made, to suggest that the reason that Palestinians behave the way that they do towards Israelis is because of a deep-seated, innate hatred of Jews.

But at the same time, corporations–despite the Supreme Court's reckoning–are not people, and existing legal remedies don't seem adequate to ensure what we arguably most want: that those crimes do not recur.

I understand we have to finance the research, but the way we do it now is an incredibly inefficient way to do it. Drug companies have a massive incentive to misrepresent their findings, they do it all the time, they say drugs are effective that turn out not to be, they conceal evidence that there are harmful side effects. People die from that, and that's because we've given them incentives. People who believe in the market should understand that we've given them enormous incentives to mislead the public, to in effect, lie about the safety and effectiveness of their drugs.

Also, because of the patent system, they keep their research secret as much as they can. Pfizer doesn't want to give away its research findings to Merck, to its competitors; why on Earth would they do that? That makes sense for Pfizer, but it doesn't make sense if you want to see drugs develop rapidly to treat new diseases.

So it's an incredibly inefficient, archaic system, and we should be having a discussion about how you modernize the system of financing drug research. But as I said, the drug industry is very powerful, and they really don't want to have that discussion.",'We Could Have All These Drugs Available at Generic Prices',link,http://fair.org/home/we-could-have-all-these-drugs-available-at-generic-prices/,2015-10-01 22:22:50,398,8,233,398,0,0,0,0,0

Shifting consumer preferences—assuming that the Times feature could steer eaters in a coherent direction—might encourage farmers to switch from one crop to another, redeploying their water allocations to whichever food products people are eating more of. But only a change in government policies can stop agribusiness from taking as much water as it can—and California Gov. Jerry Brown has so far shown no signs of interest in such a change.

Evidence mounts that the practice produces many unwanted and harmful outcomes—for the mental and physical health of those placed in isolation, for the public safety of the communities to which most will return, and for the corrections budgets of jurisdictions that rely on it for facility safety.

The question media need to ask themselves is this: Is the average ""impressionable"" Sunni Muslim in London or Brussels or New York more likely to be introduced to the ISIS spectacle via a random jihadist on Twitter (the average of which has 1,014  followers) or from CNN, which reaches 387 million homes worldwide and gets over 14 million clicks a day? The answer, mathematically speaking, is of course the latter. Indeed, one can even trace the popularity of so-called ISIS social media propagandist by their corollary appearances in western media.

Consider the case of UK radical imam Anjem Choudary. During the escalation of the US war against ISIS in fall of 2014, the greatest thing that ever happened to his social media brand was his numerous appearances on corporate media—from CNN to Fox News to the Washington Post to the highest-rated news program on television, CBS's 60 Minutes. His Twitter following, according archive records, more than doubled from August to November thanks to this exposure.

What caused this sudden surge in popularity? The answer, to anyone who's taken Public Relations 101, is obvious: There is no such thing as bad publicity, and the Choudarys of the world know this.

With a multi-count Espionage Act conviction, it serves as yet another warning shot—not only against whistleblowing and disclosure of classified information, but also against basic communication with journalists by government employees and contractors.

Over decades, while interviewing sources with security clearances, hundreds of journalists have had the experience of asking questions and receiving a reply along the lines of: I can't tell you the answer because it's classified, but I can tell you (fill in the blank). Such responses mean that sources can be helpful to a reporter's investigative process without disclosing any classified information. But one of the evident aims of the Sterling prosecution was to strengthen government efforts to choke off such communications. The not-so-subtle gist: Telling a journalist anything that might lead to coverage of classified information could be a basis for prosecution and conviction.

In 1968, following hundreds of similar riots nationwide, a commission appointed by President Lyndon Johnson concluded that ""[o]ur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal"" and that ""[s]egregation and poverty have created in the racial ghetto a destructive environment totally unknown to most white Americans."" The Kerner Commission (headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner) added that ""[w]hat white Americans have never fully understood—but what the Negro can never forget—is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.""

In the last 50 years, the two societies have become even more unequal. Although a relatively small black middle class has been permitted to integrate itself into mainstream America, those left behind are more segregated now than they were in 1968.

When the Kerner Commission blamed ""white society"" and ""white institutions,"" it employed euphemisms to avoid naming the culprits everyone knew at the time. It was not a vague white society that created ghettos but government—federal, state, and local—that employed explicitly racial laws, policies, and regulations to ensure that black Americans would live impoverished, and separately from whites. Baltimore's ghetto was not created by private discrimination, income differences, personal preferences, or demographic trends, but by purposeful action of government in violation of the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments. These constitutional violations have never been remedied, and we are paying the price in the violence we saw this week.

It's instructive to go back to 2003, when the war began, and look at the corporate media at the time. You know, the group, media group FAIR, Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting, in New York, did a study of the two weeks around Colin Powell, then secretary of State—I think it was February 5, 2003, giving that push for war at the UN, that speech he would later call a ""blot"" on his career, where he said the final evidence is in on weapons of mass destruction. 

FAIR looked at the four major nightly newscasts in the two weeks around that speech, which was critical. It was six weeks before the invasion of Iraq, the most critical time when, as Noam Chomsky says, the media is ""manufacturing consent"" for war. And they looked at the four major nightly newscasts—NBC Nightly News, the ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News and the PBS NewsHour. 

That two-week period, there were 393 interviews done around war. This is at a time in the U.S. when about half the population was for war, half the population was against war. Three hundred ninety-three interviews done. How many were with antiwar leaders? Three. Three of almost 400. That is no longer a mainstream media; that's an extreme media beating the drums for war.

That has to be challenged.

The New York Times (1/23/15) printed an obituary that adopted the US government's dishonest official narrative of the Saudi despot.

Originally headlined ""King Abdullah, Who Nudged Saudi Arabia Forward, Died at 90,"" the Times article claimed that the dictator had ""earned a reputation as a cautious reformer."" Under the subheading ""Moves of Moderation,"" reporters Douglas Martin and Ben Hubbard unironically noted that Abdullah, a ""force of moderation,"" had ""hundreds of militants arrested and some beheaded.""

To put into context the paper's impressive feat--laundering the Saudi dictator into a forward-thinking reformer--consider the Times' treatment of an actually elected leader who was not a stalwart US ally, but rather the target of ongoing US attempts at regime change. In 2013, the New York Times (3/5/13) published a harsh portrait of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez upon his death. ""A Polarizing Figure Who Led a Movement,"" by Times reporter Simon Romero, posthumously characterized Chávez as a man who had been ""consolidating power,"" ""strutting like the strongman in a caudillo novel.""...

Missing from Romero's look back at Chávez was the fact that, unlike genuine autocrats such as Abdullah, Chávez had repeatedly won free and fair elections that were characterized by former US President Jimmy Carter as ""the best in the world.""... And unlike Abdullah, who had supposedly ""nudged"" Saudi Arabia forward, Chávez had presided over enormous reductions in income inequality, poverty, food insecurity and infant mortality (Extra!, 12/12).",Saudi Dictator's Death Shows NYT as Pawn of Power,link,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/01/27/saudi-dictators-death-shows-nyt-pawn-power,2015-01-27 17:55:47,183,6,65,183,0,0,0,0,0

Many commentators and pundits take a position of ""permit but discourage,"" or maybe a better way to put it in their own case is ""permit but deplore."" They want abortion to be legal, at least in the early weeks, but they want to make clear it's a bad thing and there's way too much of it—not because our high rates of abortion indicate that women aren't getting good sexual information and good birth control, or lack power in their relationships with men, or because poverty and lack of support are making women terminate wanted pregnancies, but because abortion, in and of itself, is morally troubling.

It's a seductive position for people who make their living by staking out intellectual positions that resist, or appear to resist, tired pieties. Defying both camps lets one feel sensitive and judicious and mature, alert to moral complexities, above the vulgar slogan war—a plague on both your houses!...

The safest position for a member of the commentariat seems to be: You can have your abortion as long as you feel really, really bad about it.

""And looking over the last century, the bloodiest in human history, it's an equally strange argument to make from a Western, Christian-majority nation. As University of Michigan Islam scholar Juan Cole (Informed Comment, 4/23/13) points out, of the more than 100 million war deaths in the 20th century, something less than 2 percent came at the hands of Muslim-majority nations. Most of those dead came in wars where non-Muslim nations played a significant role—such as the Iran/Iraq War, where the United States aided the aggressor Iraq, and the Afghan Civil War, where the Soviet Union was a major military force.

""Cole also explains that 'murder rates in most of the Muslim world are very low compared to the United States,' which is especially violent for a wealthy nation.

""According to a Gallup poll (8/2/11; FAIR Blog, 5/3/13), Muslim Americans disapprove of violence against civilians at an exceptionally high rate. When asked if it 'is justified for an individual or a small group of people to target and kill civilians,' 89 percent of Muslims said that it is never justified, which was the highest disapproval rate of the six religious and nonreligious groups polled.
