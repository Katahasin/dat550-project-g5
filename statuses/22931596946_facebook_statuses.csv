The award is named for Sargent Shriver, architect of the War on Poverty and visionary leader of Head Start, Peace Corps, Job Corps and VISTA, who worked throughout his life to provide opportunities for people to lift themselves out of poverty.

This year's honorees are not just participants in social justice work – they are leading the way. They have taken action in their schools to reduce violence and challenge biased discipline policies. They have stood up for low-wage workers by demanding living wages and fair working conditions. They have mobilized in support of immigrants by fighting against discriminatory laws and deportations, and educating their immigrant neighbors about their rights under the law.

They are also helping to inspire their peers and members of their community to raise their voices through public speaking and social media, and to share their stories through art, music and video. 

Through their work in their communities, these young people are carrying out Sargent Shriver's call to ""serve, serve, serve!""
