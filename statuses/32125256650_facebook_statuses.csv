Today, long gone is any aversion to war that Americans might once have felt. Principled opposition to war has been consigned to the margins of national politics. In the Senate, there is no heir to Robert La Follette. And contemporary equivalents of Jane Addams don't get invited to the White House to consult on foreign policy.

Against steep odds, Kazin's protagonists came up short. Today those odds have become steeper still.

Unfortunately, that assessment is correct. A new report out today tells us that U.S. military involvement in multiple countries is increasing ""with no end in sight,"" but this intensification of our foreign wars isn't likely to produce much opposition. Even when the U.S. was not used to involving itself in the wars of other nations, pro-war hysteria prevailed. Now we are so accustomed to unending war that there is no need for pro-war hysteria to overwhelm the opposition.

The Dark Ages were inexcusable and rather disreputable—a bad time when the machine of civilization in its matchless climb to the twentieth century had sheared a whole rank of king-pins and landed mankind in a centuries-long ditch. At best, it was a time when monks sat in unsanitary cells with a human skull before them, and copied and recopied, for lack of more fruitful employment, the tattered records of a dead antiquity. That was the Dark Ages at best, which, as anybody could see, was not far from the worst.

If a bright boy, leafing through history, asked: ""How did the Dark Ages come about?"" he might be told that ""Rome fell!""–as if a curtain simply dropped. Boys of ten or twelve, even if bright, are seldom bright enough to say to themselves: ""Surely, Rome did not fall in a day."" If a boy had asked: ""But were there no great figures in the Dark Ages, like Teddy Roosevelt, King Edward, and the Kaiser?"" he might well have been suspected of something like an unhealthy interest in the habits and habitats of spiders. If he had persisted and asked: ""But isn't it clear that the Dark Ages are of a piece with our age of light, that our civilization is by origin Catholic, that, in fact, we cannot understand what we have become without understanding what we came from?"" he would have been suspected of something much worse than priggery—a distressing turn to popery.","St. Benedict, Colossus Of Western History",link,http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/st-benedict-colossus-of-western-history/,2017-03-31 17:00:00,7,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,0

""When Putin took power in the winter of 1999-2000, his country was defenseless. It was bankrupt. It was being carved up by its new kleptocratic elites, in collusion with its old imperial rivals, the Americans. Putin changed that.

""In the first decade of this century, he did what Kemal Ataturk had done in Turkey in the 1920s. Out of a crumbling empire, he resurrected a nation-state, and gave it coherence and purpose. He disciplined his country's plutocrats. He restored its military strength. And he refused, with ever blunter rhetoric, to accept for Russia a subservient role in an American-run world system drawn up by foreign politicians and business leaders. His voters credit him with having saved his country.""

Putin's approval rating, after 17 years in power, exceeds that of any rival Western leader. But while his impressive strides toward making Russia great again explain why he is revered at home and in the Russian diaspora, what explains Putin's appeal in the West, despite a press that is every bit as savage as President Trump's?

Answer: Putin stands against the Western progressive vision of what mankind's future ought to be.

Same-sex marriage is a part of the whole, but is by no means the whole. I thought I was pretty clear about that in The Benedict Option.

Intersectionality provides the architectural blueprint for the kind of ""subaltern"" status-seeking that we encounter in social-justice ideology and groups. Developed in the 1970s and '80s, intersectionality seeks to describe how power intersects identities along various axes, including those of race, gender, sexuality, sexual preference, ability, and more. It aims to locate the articulations of power as it traverses various subordinated peoples in multifarious ways. Suggestive of a radical critique of patriarchy, capitalism, white supremacy—which its adherents take to be distinct but connected forms of domination—it complicates any sense of gender, sex, class, or race as homogenous wholes and it problematizes any hierarchy of one categorical determination over others. Yet in practice, intersectionality serves to isolate multiple and seemingly endless identity standpoints, without sufficiently articulating them with one another. The upshot in political practice, as Christina Hoff Sommers argues, is an endless splitting of categories, with the members of each category vying for more-subaltern-than-thou status.

If human beings suddenly ceased imitating, all forms of culture would vanish.' He calls this process mimesis. We are so individualistic as a culture, he says, that we downplay the 'leading role' that mimesis plays in our society and culture. Girard is making an anthropological point here, saying that imitation is fundamental to our humanity.

What is mimesis, then? Girard says that Plato made a basic mistake, and that mistake has been repeated throughout the whole of Western thought. He characterized mimesis as representation — that is, simply copying what other people do. Girard believes there is another dimension to mimesis, what he calls 'possessive mimesis,' or 'acquisitive mimesis.' We not only want to do what others do, but we want to have what others have. This is the source of conflict within groups; Girard calls it 'mimetic rivalry,' and he said in our distant past, we devised ways to deal with it to keep the group from tearing itself apart.
