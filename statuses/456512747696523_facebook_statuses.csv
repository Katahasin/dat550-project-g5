The Dem office had voted for it but a CPA board member has been previously working to re-educate that office. In the meetings, our message was:

    ""We appreciate your boss's vote against TPA. We want to discuss the recent Peterson and World Bank studies of the TPP and the anticipated May release of the USITC report on the TPP to show (a) their economic model is garbage, (b) their model produces the most optimistic possible results, and (c) even if we accept their optimistic model, there is no net job creation, no net trade balance improvement and almost undetectable growth over the next 15 years. If the most optimistic assessment cannot produce jobs, growth or trade balance improvement, everything else is just irrelevant noise. Thus, (d) if anyone claims future optimistic results exceeding these models, you must not trust them because they are either misleading you or are uninformed.""

They all understood this simple message.

Facebook friends, first thank you for your support. Thank you for your likes, your shares and your comments. Thank you for your support. 

It is with sad news that I tell you today that Economy In Crisis is shutting down. Our founder and financial benefactor is passing away. Our last writer will be moving to another job at the end of this month. Many long time readers have likely realized that we have been running a lot of reruns in the past month or so. 

However, this does not mean EIC has to die. We have tried fundraising in the past, and we collected very little money. I will not be trying to raise funds, at this time, to keep this project going. 

What I will do, is ask you to help. I would like to keep this Facebook page active and strong. To do this, I need nonpartisan volunteers to help monitor the page. To talk to EIC readers and, sadly, ban abusers. If anyone is interested, please let me know. 

We are not sure what is going to happen with the EIC website yet. If it is to remain open, we would need volunteer writers. Again, if you have any interest in writing, please let me know. 

We don't have to be rich to save this country, we just have to be motivated. If you share our passion, our motivation, please let us know what you would like to do to help keep this work going.

Thank you.",,status,,2015-09-23 10:37:46,114,26,14,114,0,0,0,0,0

In every major market downturn throughout history there were big ups, big downs and giant waves of momentum, and this time around will not be any different.  As I have explained repeatedly, markets tend to go up when things are calm, and they tend to go down when things get really choppy.  During a market meltdown, we fully expect to see days when the stock market absolutely soars.  Waves of panic selling are often followed by waves of panic buying.  As you will see below, six of the ten best single day gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average happened during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.  So don't be fooled for a moment by a very positive day for stocks like we are seeing on Tuesday.  It is all part of the dance.
