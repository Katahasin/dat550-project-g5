In a shower of over 20 bullets, police killed Michelle Lee Shirley on Monday.

She wasn't a mass shooter or a drug kingpin, had no gun or knife, and posed no threat to the life of any police officer.

She was a mother to her young son. She struggled day to day with bipolar disorder. And on certain days, like on Monday, she needed more help than others.

Seeing her driving erratically, the police boxed her car in with their cars so she couldn't drive away or hit anyone.

It's a police tactic specifically designed to make it impossible for someone to be a danger with their car. It was successfully used with Michelle.

But despite her being *unable to harm anyone*, the police executed her in broad daylight when she was unable to obey their commands and continued to slowly move her vehicle.

It was all recorded on video, so the police are unable to lie this time to cover their crimes.

All she needed was help.

It's the files on the torture conducted by Chicago Police. 

The files cover up until 1991, but don't for a second think that's when the practices stopped, as the recent discovery of the 'Black Site' where the cops took suspects attests. 

It's clear the cancer in the American criminal justice system runs far deeper than body cams or implicit bias trainings will be able to reach.

What's also clear is that departments like the Chicago Police don't just need federal oversight - they need to be shut down and replaced by an entirely different institution, culture, and leadership.

BUT, the reality is that the divide is less about gender and more about what has always been the primary driver of American politics: race.

Yes, if only white men voted, Trump would overwhelmingly win. 

But if only white women voted, then Trump would *also* win.

Let that sink in for a moment - even with all the misogynist and sexually predatory behavior Trump has shown, a majority of white women would vote in alignment with their racial identity over their interests as women.

The same thing is true around college-educated vs. non-college educated white people. 

Despite the comforting image of Trump supporters as poor and uneducated white people, the majority of college-educated white people would also vote in Trump.

So who do we really have to thank from saving us from a precipitous slide into neo-fascism? 

Women of color. 

Another chilling takeaway from this map is the obvious next question, why aren't the votes of men of color off-setting the male vote like with women? Is it because more men of color are voting for Trump? 

Probably not.

While this map doesn't break it down, the reason almost certainly lies more with the widespread disenfranchisement of Black and Brown men, who after being massively disproportionately targeted by the criminal justice system then have their vote taken away from them for life.

'Entitlements': Always meant to imply 'giveaways' of hard-earned tax dollars (of course from hard-working white Americans) to undeserving and unemployed people of color, despite the fact that most recipients of programs like food stamps and Medicaid are white.

An NYPD officer shot and killed a 66-year old Black woman who had a mental illness.

Just this summer she had tweeted that she felt like she had a target on her back just because she is Black.

The officer had a stun gun, but decided to use lethal force instead.

Even city officials are coming out in condemnation of the shooting:

""New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed the shooting at a news conference Wednesday, saying, ""Deborah Danner should be alive right now, period. If the protocols had been followed, she would be alive. It's as simple as that.""

Police Commissioner James O'Neill echoed the mayor's sentiment, saying that it looked as if some of the procedures for handling ""emotionally disturbed people"" were not followed.

""That's not how it's supposed to go,"" he said. ""It's not how we train; our first obligation is to preserve life, not to take a life when it can be avoided.

""We do have policies and procedures for handling emotionally disturbed people, and it looks like that some of those procedures weren't followed,"" O'Neill added. ""What is clear in this one instance is we failed.""

Yes, we need to talk about Bill Clinton.

And we need to talk about why this is the first time in years that allegations of sexual misconduct and assault against him are in the national spotlight.

The women who have come forward over the years with allegations that Bill Clinton engaged in professional misconduct, sexual abuse, and assault - women like Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, and Juanita Broaddrick - have often been maligned, laughed off, or ignored by the media.

Meanwhile, Bill Clinton has remained wealthy and powerful and will very likely end up back in the White House.

In a stunning display of hypocrisy, Donald Trump - a sexual predator himself and man who has mocked some of the women in the past while defending his long-time friend Bill Clinton - has chosen to put these women's stories back in the spotlight. And the fact is, those on the left cannot ignore or sweep these women and their stories under the rug.

If we are to stand against sexual harassment and support survivors of sexual assault, we must talk about Bill Clinton. We must call for him to be held accountable for his actions. We must examine the ways in which we on the left can also be guilty of enabling abusers and silencing survivors.

But we must also take note of the fact that too often in this election, the stories of survivors have been used as political ""gotchas"" rather than as calls for justice.

When Donald Trump attacks Bill Clinton for being an abuser of women, he is deflecting from his own actions and using Bill Clinton's wrongdoings as ammunition against Hillary Clinton.

That's not holding Bill accountable for his actions. That's not respecting those he's used or hurt. That's not demanding that he face further consequences for any of his actions. It's using the stories of women who Bill wronged to harm the political campaign of another woman who Bill wronged. It's waiting until it's politically expedient to finally address the elephant in the room.

So yes, we on the left need to talk about it.

This is the reality of rape culture.

That every time a woman walks out of the meeting with men, there's a queasy uncertainty about what they might be saying once she's gone.

That's also rape culture.

Weapons were pointed at the peaceful protectors and defenders of our sacred water.

Rules of engagement offer only in the event a weapon is pose or pointed at a police officer only then can a police officers can point their weapon at a person As pointing a loaded weapon at unarmed people isn't called for as this is the use of lethal weapons.

The use to tear gas was also used on the peaceful yet unarmed people who were in prayer, There was no destruction to property, there was no rioting at all but only a peaceful prayer moment for the sacred ground of our ancestors.

The police actions didn't warrant this at all. Many of the people at the prayer site were young children's, young adults and elders who took part in the prayer ceremony. Never in the years of an elderly have they had loaded weapons pointed at them.

Of course this is the racist Dakota's where civil rights of people don't matter to the authorities (police) and many people civil rights have been violated over and over along with the due process of those who have been arrested.

--

Of course, this assumes the main political goals of our nation's vast military apparatus are primarily overseas, when in fact many of them are domestic.

The military functions domestically as a form of economic stimulus, although a highly inefficient one. This is why politicians are loath to cut military budgets, as much of that spending ends up back in their home states. 

But this kind of spending is the worst kind of dead-end economic stimulus, as it doesn't support our infrastructure or industries like clean energy that will boost the rest of the economy. 

The military also serves an important welfare function, providing jobs to almost 2 million military personnel (more if we count the private security firms), most of whom sit on military bases scattered around the world doing not very much. 

All of which makes the carnage we've inflicted on the rest of the world even more tragic and indefensible.","Killing people, breaking things and America's winless wars: Details of the dismal U.S. military record",link,http://www.salon.com/2016/09/28/killing-people-breaking-things-and-americas-winless-wars-details-of-the-dismal-u-s-military-record_partner/,2016-09-28 10:44:00,164,13,121,106,1,1,0,36,20

This morally bankrupt justification also conveniently ignores what whites did in creating a domestic slave business that became vastly bigger in the U.S. than the Atlantic Slave trade ever was. The American Slave Coast discloses how a sophisticated infrastructure of financiers, plantation owners, traders, haulers, marketers, lawmakers and law enforcers built an economy in which slaves became as valuable, if not more so, than the fruits of their labor. Starting in 1808, that economy severely restricted the African slave trade—not because they thought it was wrong but because they wanted to protect their domestic slave breeding and slave trading business from competition.  

As with any capitalist enterprise, the domestic slave breeding and trading industry required growth to survive.

Trump is doing the same thing - but this time he's trying to reassure white voters that he's not *really* racist, so they can vote for him and not feel like they are racist if they do.

It goes without saying that this never would have happened had the boy been white. But why?

There is a long history in America of denying the childhood and innocence of Black children. It was a part of the dehumanization and brutal exploitation that existed under both slavery and our version of apartheid, Jim Crow. 

But since at least the Reagan years, it's also been a central part of a deliberate political strategy to win working class white support by demonizing Black people. 

From the war on drugs (i.e. war on Black communities) to the repeated image of Black boys as 'super predators' throughout mainstream media, white America has been conditioned to see Black boys as criminals, thugs, drug dealers, and delinquents. 

As anyone but happy and carefree children.

This conscious political strategy of demonization is seeing its most naked and extreme form in Donald Trump. So explicit that it is almost ceasing to be a dog-whistle.

3) The police apparently heard their own gun shots and thought it was from the victim.

4) Despite shooting this unarmed man, the police did not call for an ambulance, but instead made calls to the FOP (police union) first.

5) The police officers gave each other high-fives after killing him.

""The birth and development of the American police can be traced to a multitude of historical, legal and political-economic conditions. The institution of slavery and the control of minorities, however, were two of the more formidable historic features of American society shaping early policing. Slave patrols and Night Watches, which later became modern police departments, were both designed to control the behaviors of minorities. For example, New England settlers appointed Indian Constables to police Native Americans (National Constable Association, 1995), the St. Louis police were founded to protect residents from Native Americans in that frontier city, and many southern police departments began as slave patrols. In 1704, the colony of Carolina developed the nation's first slave patrol. Slave patrols helped to maintain the economic order and to assist the wealthy landowners in recovering and punishing slaves who essentially were considered property.

Policing was not the only social institution enmeshed in slavery. Slavery was fully institutionalized in the American economic and legal order with laws being enacted at both the state and national divisions of government. Virginia, for example, enacted more than 130 slave statutes between 1689 and 1865. Slavery and the abuse of people of color, however, was not merely a southern affair as many have been taught to believe. Connecticut, New York and other colonies enacted laws to criminalize and control slaves. Congress also passed fugitive Slave Laws, laws allowing the detention and return of escaped slaves, in 1793 and 1850. As Turner, Giacopassi and Vandiver (2006:186) remark, ""the literature clearly establishes that a legally sanctioned law enforcement system existed in America before the Civil War for the express purpose of controlling the slave population and protecting the interests of slave owners. The similarities between the slave patrols and modern American policing are too salient to dismiss or ignore. Hence, the slave patrol should be considered a forerunner of modern American law enforcement.""

Black women feel the burn of institutionalized racism just as painfully as we do. Black lives being gunned down by the power structure affects us all; it's a public health issue that threatens our communities. If the police keep picking off members of our community, EVEN for obeying the law, what's going to be left?

We can't expect women to be at the forefront of these movements without acknowledging that they're not just there to support men, but because they also feel the same sting and same circumstances that we do.

The recent picture of Ieshia Evans, standing tall and serene while the two police officers looking as if they're prepared to face off against a gas chamber, speaks truth to this power. This Black woman from New York City came down to Baton Rouge to face off against the enemy and did it in the way only a Black woman can, often silently, but as powerfully as any man. She's there for many reasons, but mainly, because what happens to the Black community in Baton Rouge affects the community in New York City, St. Paul, Minnesota, Ferguson, Missouri, Chicago, Illinois, and anywhere else we are. The picture is powerful in that it shows the stark contrasts in demeanor and purpose. Ieshia is stoically and peacefully asserting her right to be here while the police officers are in action mode against the Black body at rest. I'd like to call it the irresistible force paradox, but we all know how that story ends. Luckily because of the circumstances, it only ends with her in jail.

But Black women are front and center to this movement because they have to be for their own good. Institutional racism affects all of us. Our community can't thrive unless Black men and women recognize and acknowledge each other in it. It's the only way to achieve real progress.
Because some cops may be gunning for Black men, but a Black woman will do.""
