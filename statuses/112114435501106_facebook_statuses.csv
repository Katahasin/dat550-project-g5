I was happy to get up very early to talk about the nonsense charges against Marco Rubio and the absurd witch hunt into Ben Carson's past even as new stories about Hillary's NDA --from the Washington Free Beacon-- and about Teneo's stonewalling --from Reuters on Friday-- are ignored, but Joe was in a bad move and wanting to be a martyr for some reason. Be sure to watch the whole thing. 
 I don't think the hosts were listening very closely to what I was saying, but the truth is the truth. The lede today should be the NDA and Teneo, not Ben Carson's ROTC days. The former matters a lot. The latter looks like, well, obsession. And the utter demolition of the attacks on Marco Rubio deserved more time as did Donald Trump's enormous ratings on SNL. But I don't produce the show, I only appear when asked.  And I will never apologize for pointing out systemic Manhattan-Beltway media elite bias.

HH: Do you remember that ad from Super Bowl, 2011? You will when you open the first few pages of a brand new book, Once In A Great City: A Detroit Story by David Maraniss who joins me now. David, you were watching that ad in a bar, and it got you?

 

DM: It sure did. I don't know what that says about me, but yes, I was in New York City, and I teared up by the end of that ad. My wife later said to me, you know, why are you falling for that? They're just selling cars, and Detroit's a mess. But it got me thinking about what Detroit meant to me, and also what it meant to this whole country. To me, I was born there. I lived the first seven and a half years of my life in Detroit, and that ad just went somewhere very deep inside me and got me thinking about what I could do. And what I do is write, so I decided to write a book about it.

 

HH: You're the bestselling author of many extraordinary books, and I was a little surprised. I met you at Meet The Press a few weeks ago, and I got this book and started to read it, finished it on the plane from D.C. last night, made my notes, and said this is going to surprise a lot of people on how it emotionally grabs him. Maybe you have to be 50 years and older. I'm not sure. You have to have a little Motown in your life. That could be at any time in your life. But if it does, you can't put it down. Have you been hearing that from people?

 

DM: You know, Hugh, this book has resonated very deeply, and not just with people of our, of my, you know, post-war baby boom Motown generation. Somehow, it just came at the right time, so yes, I am hearing that a lot.

 

HH: It begins, ""The chronology here,"" you write on Page 12, ""covers 18 months from the fall of '62 to the spring of '64. Cars were selling at a record pace.""

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: ""Motown was rocking. Labor was strong. People were marching for freedom. The President was calling Detroit a herald of hope. It was a time of uncommon possibility and freedom when Detroit created wondrous and lasting things, that life can be luminous when it is most vulnerable. There was a precarious balance during those crucial months between composition and decomposition. What the world gained and what a great city lost, even then, some part of Detroit was dying, and that is where the story begins."" It begins with something, I actually, I'm born in 1956, David.

 

DM: Yup.

 

HH: I've never heard of the Ford Rotunda until I read Once In A Great City, never heard of it.

 

DM: Well, so many people had not heard of it, but it was that, you know, during its heyday, it was one of the great tourist attractions in the United States. When people came to Detroit because of the automobile industry, they'd go to the Ford Rotunda, and it had great displays of the latest cars and of Henry Ford's empire. It was kind of the symbol of auto industrial might. But it burned down on November 9th, 1962, and was never replaced. And that's sort of a symbol of what was to come.

 

HH: There's so much of the wrecking ball in the first few chapters of Once In A Great City.

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: The Gotham goes down, the Cadillac Sheraton goes down. All these things are going down. I know Detroit '80-'83. That's when I'm in law school at Ann Arbor, and I would go in, I think I told you…

 

DM: Okay, yeah.

 

HH: I'd go to Greek Town, I'd go to Tiger Stadium. And the Renaissance Center had been built, and that shabby Super Bowl was held.

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: But most of the damage had been done by then.

 

DM: By fire, absolutely. You know, the study of, the book is not, you know, I'm not a financial writer. I'm not trying to pretend I can explain all of the financial parts of the demise of Detroit, but what I did notice is that in that period between '62 and '64, so many of the structural, deeper structural problems were already there before the riots of 1967, which certainly accentuated things, and before the bloated pensions of later years and the municipal corruption. There were things stacked against Detroit even in the late 50s and early 60s.

 

HH: It's all in the book, America, whether you love Al Kaline and Alex Karras, whether you're a Motown freak, whether you want to know about JFK at Michigan launching the Peace Corps, or LBJ coming back to launch the Great Society, it's all there. But it begins with an astonishing set of facts. In Detroit in 1960, there were 1,670,000 people. The city was 28.9% black. It fell by a mission people in 50 years, David Maraniss. That's, it's a warning to every metropolis in the world, isn't it?

 

DM: It certainly is. I call Detroit sort of an exaggeration of the urban woes of so many places in the world. You know, it was hindered by being a one company town, all dependent on the automotive industry. And that industry turning away from Detroit both in terms of its factories and then sort of emotionally for various reason, I think to its regret today, but also so many other factors with the productive taxpayers leaving the city made it easier by all of the great freeways in Detroit, and also the unsettling of established African-American neighborhoods through probably well-intentioned urban renewal that had the opposite effect. So all of those factors played into Detroit's demise, but sociologists at Wayne State University in 1963 predicted exactly what was going to happen, sadly. They said it would lose a half million people per decade.

 

HH: My notes, my margin notes are wow, wow, wow. ""Productive people who pay taxes are leaving the city in a Wayne State University report.

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: Laid it all down, and I think now I live in California now, and I was a stepchild of Detroit, because I'm from Warren, Ohio. We had a GM Packard plant, and a Lordstown plant.

 

DM: Sure.

 

HH: And if Detroit caught a cold, we caught a fever, right? And so we were completely dependent on it.

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: And the same thing's happening again. So do you think there's a parable here, or maybe more than a parable, a cautionary tale for every metropolitan leader?

 

DM: Well, I have two answers to that. One is yes. If we had all of the answers, though, this would be a magical world, right?

 

HH: Right.

 

DM: Unfortunately, but I think that one way you can look at it is that whenever a city or an area goes for short term gain as opposed to long term stability, it suffers. And I think that happened, to a large degree, in Detroit. Some of it might have been inevitable, but a lot of it was small decisions you'll see throughout the book that added up to trouble. The other positive aspect of it is Detroit hit such a rock bottom that it's coming back. And I was there last week, and the energy was palpable and delightful. And there's so many young people moving to Detroit now because it's, you can start at the bottom and be creative, and it's cheap housing, and they're, you know, they're turning it into, I would call it the new Brooklyn, but Detroiters don't like to hear that. But there's also in the downtown area a lot of investment going on, you know, rich people gambling on the city again and wanting to help it succeed.

 

HH: Dan Gilbert very rarely is wrong…

 

DM: So, but yes, I think we can learn from Detroit, but also it's what's coming now.

 

HH: Yeah, Dan Gilbert is very rarely wrong when he makes a bet. But let me remind people, I didn't know this until I read Once In A Great City: A Detroit Story, which is linked at Hughhewitt.com, perfect Christmas present, but just read it for yourself. They bid for the '68 Olympics. Talk about hubris, the Detroit Olympics.

 

DM: Oh, man, well, but they thought they had a shot at it.

 

HH: Well, they came in second.

 

DM: They came in second, and they had been the U.S nominee before that several times. This, they thought, was their time. It's, the decision was made in 1963. They lost to Mexico City. And what fascinates me, you know, it's counterfactual history, what if, but there are a lot of what ifs in life, and in the story of this city. But what if Detroit had gotten those Olympics? Would the powers that be in Detroit had been more sensitive to the problems bubbling up, and somehow have prevented the riots of 1967? We don't know. Maybe not, but it's interesting to ponder. On the other side, what if the Olympics had been held in Detroit in 1968, that year of black power, when Tommy Smith and John Carlos raised their fists in Mexico City? If that had happened in Detroit, one of the heartbeats of African-American life in the U.S., it could have been quite something.

 

--- - -- - -

 

HH: I can't even say it, David. How do you say Harvardania? You know, I went to Harvard. I should be able to pronounce it. But the band played it when John F. Kennedy flew into town, into Detroit, in 1962, just as the Cuban Missile Crisis was about to unload on him. And he really, he really thought Michigan was where it all happened for him. It was the center of American political power for a while.


DM: Well, you know, traditionally, the Democratic candidates for president would open their fall campaigns in Detroit, in Cadillac Square, with Walter Ruther, the United Auto Workers president, at their side. There's two interesting facts to Kennedy's appearance there. One is that it was in Detroit that he gave sort of the first, a variation of his most famous phrase, the ask not what your country can do for you. He didn't put the ask not at the beginning, but it was the same phrase. And what fascinated me is not only that famous phrase was uttered first in Detroit, but also Martin Luther King's I have a dream speech. He gave that in Detroit before he did it in Washington. So yes, Detroit was sort of the center of not only a lot of things, but of some great rhetoric.

 

HH: There is also, there's a hint in the book, and I want to tease it out of you. If only they'd left the mob alone. You don't say that, you don't write that, you don't advocate that, but you're left wondering if they'd only left the Gotham alone, and the numbers to be run, maybe the city wouldn't have plummeted. Is there some truth to that?


DM: Well, I would put that in the what if category of a lot of other little decisions. You know, whether it was leaving the Gotham alone, I think it's a larger issue of respecting traditional communities. And Detroit, for a lot of reasons, really didn't consider what would happen with the unsettled African-American community in Detroit by, really, through urban renewal, eliminating a lot of the old Hasting Street neighborhood, the Paradise Valley or Black Bottom, as it was called. And the long term effect of that, I think, were much more deleterious than people thought they would be. So the Gotham sort of represents that. It was raided by the police, it was the center of social and cultural life in African-American Detroit, and it was never the same.

 

HH: Let's talk a little bit about Motown. And Barry Gordy, Jr., you assume that a lot of us who enjoy the music know a lot about Barry Gordy. I don't. I mean, I know about Smokey Robinson and Little Stevie Wonder and of course, I grew up to the Temptations and Marvin Gaye, but I didn't know how it got started. And it was, it's a revelation to me that the Gordy family drew up a contract, put in $800 bucks, and the whole family in three years pumped out music 22 hours a day. It's a book within a book, David Maraniss.

 

DM: Yeah, the Gordy family is extraordinary. They were entrepreneurs, African-American entrepreneurs, sort of started with the Booker T. Washington approach, and Barry Gordy was the best businessman in the family, although he had some sisters who I think are under-represented in the story as well. But they had the family, the eight siblings and the parents, would vote. They had their own fund, and they'd vote on what to give it to. And they gave $800 dollars to Barry Gordy in 1959, and from that seed money, he started the most incredible African-American music enterprise in our history, the Motown. And his story, you know, he started in the assembly line in Detroit, and really started writing songs there. And you know, everything about him is kind of really extraordinary.


HH: Oh, it's a beautiful little set piece on how his uncle teaches him to play until he gives up, because he has his own ideas and he goes forward. But there's another little aspect, which is personal to me. My chambers as a clerk on the D.C. Circuit were next to Judge Edwards, the great liberal scion, and I had no idea he had a connection to Motown. I mean, he's just the great liberal judge of the D.C. Circuit…

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: And here he is connected up to Motown.


DM: Well, I didn't know it, either, until I found that out. And you know, he doesn't give interviews, but he talked to me for this book. You know, he's very proud of the fact that he's in D.C., and in the federal courts, and never talks to the press. But he was a great connection for me. He is the stepson of Esther Edwards, the older sister of Barry Gordy, and has a deep connection to Motown. He had his wedding at Barry Gordy's mansion, and his honeymoon at Barry Gordy's mansion in Bel Air in L.A.

 

HH: Now you know, there's a movie to be made. I don't know if it's been made on the Motor Town Review, or the Motown tour, whatever you want to call it, but it's been made in a lot of 70s-style Almost Famous sorts of things. But did anyone ever try and capture, Tom Hanks did it with his movie, but did anyone try and capture the African-American experience of Motown going on the road?

 

DM: A little bit. You know, there are sort of B-rated movies about the Temptations and their demise, and rise and fall, but nothing really deeply. There's a little bit of a, in the very fun, Motown the Musical on Broadway, which is touring the country now, I think, it's discussed a little bit. But you're right. Just that, you could do just a documentary on those three months of their first Motor Town Review, and it would be quite something.

 

HH: And jamming everyone in there now. Barry Gordy did not go along on the bus. He flew along.

 

DM: He flew.

 

HH: But they were one sort of vast family. And when tragedy occurred on the tour in the South, everyone sucks it up and goes out and performs. It's very moving. Was that all told to you first person? Or is that well-known out there?


DM: Well, all of my reporting is, I start with primary interviews and documents. You know, a few books mention it, but I interviewed the people to get my own story. And no, just think about the talent on that one bus – Little Stevie Wonder at age 12 or 13, Mary Wells, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, the Supremes singing, they were the opening act, and nobody knew if they were good enough to actually be part of it, yet. I mean, it was really quite something.

 

HH: Now in terms of when it moves west, when did it end? When did it, did it leave when the riots destroyed the town?

 

DM: Yes, it left a year, it left two years after, it was slowly leaving. Marvin, Barry Gordy had fallen in love with L.A. a couple of years in the late 60s, and was determined to get out of Detroit, and by '71 and '72, they were gone. I say, and you know, sadly, at the end of the book, that virtually every major character or thing in my book either dies or is destroyed. You know, Walter Ruther dies in a plane crash, Barry Gordy leaves and Motown leaves L.A. Aretha's father, Aretha Franklin's father is Reverend C.L. Franklin, is another character in the book.

 

HH: Oh, that's so, a four year coma?

 

DM: Yeah,

 

HH: A four year…


DM: He get bad and is in a coma for many years. Even the Mustang, in my opinion, got sort of fad and wasn't the same in the later 60s and early 70s when it was when it first came out in '64 ½.

 

HH: When we come back from break, we're going to talk about, of course, Motor City. Part of the whole story of Detroit is the rise. There's very little George Romney, but he does have a few cameos in here.

 

DM: Yes, he does.

 

HH: It's almost at the beginning of his era. The end of his era as a car man, the beginning of his era as a politician, correct, David Maraniss?

 

DM: That's right. He'd just taken over as governor of Michigan.


HH: But there were, I didn't realize that he had beaten a war hero. And I'd read all that stuff, but I didn't realize that it was a war hero that he managed to overcome in '62.

 

DM: Well, you know, in that era, I don't think it was, they didn't make as much of a deal out of it one way or the other. Swainson, Governor Swainson, didn't make too much of it, and there was no effort to, in the modern era, Swift Boat the guy or whatever. I don't know if they could have. But so, because there were so many World War II veterans then, it was just sort of part of, you know, it wasn't really part of the political atmosphere.

 

--- - -- - -

 

HH: Of all the songs of which the backstories are produced in the course of David Maraniss' new book, Once In A Great City: A Detroit Story, this one written by Barry Gordy, is itself the best backstory, because he wrote it because he was turned down on the dance floor, David Maraniss.

 

DM: That's right, Do You Love Me by the Contours. When Barry Gordy was a teenager, they'd go to the Greystone Ballroom on Woodward Avenue in Detroit, and he kept getting turned down by girls. They wouldn't dance with the guy. So Do You Love Me is sort of his act of sweet revenge, you know, now not only could he dance, but he had, he was a success by the time he wrote that song.

 

HH: Now in the next segment, I want to talk about the problem of race, which is intertwined in the entire book.

 

DM: Yeah.


HH: But let me pause for a moment on the joyful side of the city. They are fanatical sports fans. I am from Cleveland, NEO, Northeastern Ohio, so I know these people. And they're always wrong, but you talk about Alex Karras and Al Kaline and Gordie Howe and Night Train Lane, and this is a city that loved its sports people. But their sports people loved the mob. It's a fascinating, again, it's a book within a book.

 

DM: Yeah, well, there was, you know, I think that there are connections in a lot of different cities with the shadier side of life. Alex Karras, who was a very colorful and interesting and iconoclastic human being as well as football player, you know, was a part-owner in a bar that was very closely connected to the mob. And the mob in Detroit had what they called the party bus, a re-confitted city bus that they put in a bar, and they'd go around town and pick up prostitutes and football players, and sometimes even take those football players to away games in your Cleveland.

 

HH: Oh, I know. Cleveland makes a cameo on Page 119 because of a rare NFL doubleheader.

 

DM: Yeah.


HH: You also brought back memories, distant memories of the playoff bowl. I think most of us have tried to put that out of our memory, it was such a horrible sports event. But I am curious at what point did, when they built the Pistons out of town, and they, Tiger Stadium was falling apart…

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: Did you see any symmetry between the city's collapse and its failure to care for its sports institutions?

 

DM: Well, yes. You know, you never want to make too much out of city stadiums and sports institutions, because so often, the owners, you know, the rich owners try to milk the cities out of it.

 

HH: Right.


DM: But nonetheless, I think there is a very important connection, and particularly in these old industrial cities like Detroit and Cleveland and Pittsburgh, the sports is so central to the sense of self of the place. And when the Lions and the Pistons left the city of Detroit, absolutely it had a reverberating impact on it.

 

HH: Now I don't know that people will recall, but you bring it out through the January 11th, 1963 Life Magazine. There was a glow of a new New York. Now it's almost impossible for people listening today to believe that, David. I mean, did you, I know you spent six and a half years there as a young lad. I had never heard about the Ford Tower, the real Donner and Blitzen. You know, I don't have any memory of big Detroit.

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: But it must have been immense.

 

DM: Yeah, the glow from Detroit was the cover of Life Magazine in January of 1963, and it did seem to be glowing then, in all the ways that I write about in the book, particularly you know, I start one of the early scenes in the book is the 1962 Detroit Auto Show, which is to Detroit what the Academy Awards are to L.A., or the White House Correspondent's Dinner to Washington. And that, it was a huge deal, and that auto show, that unveiled the 1963 cars, which sold more than any in history, and at the same time, sort of very secretly, Ford Motor Company was, and the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, were jointly planning the creation and the marketing of the Mustang, the sexy car of the 60s. So it was a boom time in Detroit.

 

HH: Oh, your backstage at the show, has the show come back, David Maraniss? There's still a show, right? But I don't know, is it…

 

DM: There is still a show, and yes, it is coming back, particularly in the last couple of years, you know, when the industry came back a little bit. Yeah, and you know, as I said, was just in Detroit, and it was far more than the auto industry now. It's no longer as dependent on one industry as it used to be, because of Dan Gilbert and so many others who are either the big money boys who are gambling on the downtown, or the kids who are flooding into the Midtown area.

 

HH: And how are the suburbs doing? You know, the first race I ever ran was in Mt. Clemons, which was always an autoworker town. It's when I was in law school. It was probably a 1981 race, something like that. Are they coming back as well?

 

DM: Well, it depends on what suburbs you're talking about. Warren, Mt. Clemons, I mean, Highland Park is one of the saddest places in the world, which is you know, outside of Detroit. But it's so bad that it has the worst school system than Detroit itself.

 

HH: Wow, that is bad.

 

--- - - -- -

 

HH: It's from '62 and '64, and maybe the hinge, but  a lot of us think of '67-'68 as the hinge. David Maraniss has written about that, and I'm going to come back to that in the last segment. But on the day that Kennedy was killed, Aretha Franklin is shopping. This wonderful Bob Anthony character that you come up with is cleaning incinerators. Gordy is yelling at Marvin Gaye, don't you realize the President's been killed, and it's kind of a moment in time where the tumble begins, David Maraniss.


DM: Yes, you know, there are a lot of those sorts of forebodings in this book. And certainly Kennedy's assassination is one of them. And there were, there are many more connections to Detroit than I realized, you know, including the fact that the car that Kennedy was assassinated in was, you know, came out of Detroit, of course.

 

HH: Yeah.

 

DM: It was a Ford limousine. And now it's back in Greenfield Village, kind of eerily. One of, you know, one of my favorite moments or sort of weird moments in that whole thing is that Jack Ruby's brother lived in Detroit, you know, the guy who killed Lee Harvey Oswald ran a dry cleaners in Detroit.

 

HH: Right.

 

DM: And that a reporter from the Detroit News was one of the pallbearers at Lee Harvey Oswald's forlorn funeral down in the Dallas area.

 

HH: Yeah, and just three or four years ago, I stopped coming back from a law school reunion in Greenfield Village. My wife didn't actually believe it existed. It was empty, I mean, just completely empty. And it's still an amazing place. But what I wanted to ask, do in this segment, Chapter 7, Reverend Cleage does not want to be with the Reverend C.L. Franklin, who is Aretha's father, or with Martin Luther King. He wants to be with Malcom X. He's an Oberlin man. That's, by the way, where my dad and brother went. He went to the U. of M. Law School. He is really a divider in a city that is dividing along race in a way that every city in America divided within the black community along race, and you captured it very nicely in this book.

 

DM: It's, you know, it's 1963. As the decade progresses, those divides within the African-American community get wider and wider, and more problematic in terms of the civil rights movement. So you know, I see it as another breaking point, in a sense. Reverend Cleage was a very charismatic preacher, as was Aretha's dad, C.L., probably the most flamboyant and colorful preacher in Detroit. But Franklin was trying to organize a rally for Martin Luther King that would bring everybody together. And in fact, he succeeded. It was a remarkably peaceful event that brought 150,000 people walking down Woodward Avenue to Cobo Hall, where Martin Luther King gave his early version of I have a dream. But Reverend Cleage didn't want Walter Ruther, the UAW president, to be marching there, or the mayor of Detroit, Jerome Cavanaugh. He didn't want any white representation. And that really sort of, he was more attuned with Malcolm X and the black power movement at that point, and it would only get more pronounced as the decade went on.

 

HH: Now was that moment, which is basically we'll do it ourselves moment, black identity moment…

 

DM: Yes.


HH: Was that replicated in other places? Or is it unique to Detroit?

 

DM: Oh, no, it was replicated almost in every, both in the North and the South. You know, not much longer after that, you had H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael, and SNCC turning, you know, SNCC, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, it started as a very integrated movement with a lot of whites from the North coming down to work on it.

 

HH: Right.


DM: And very soon after that, it became, you know, representative of black power and of very different sensibilities.

 

HH: Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out where it started, and I really, this is early.

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: This is really an early indication of it.

 

DM: No, I don't think, I wouldn't say it started in Detroit. It certainly, Malcolm X in New York City, and the Chicago, and I think it was sort of spontaneously happening in a lot of places at about the same time. But certainly, Detroit represented that in a very profound way that summer.

 

HH: And when did the drugs arrive? Once In a Great City: A Detroit Story, doesn't really give much time to it.

 

DM: Well, you're absolutely right.

 

HH: And I'm wondering when they arrived.

 

DM: Well, there certainly were drugs in Detroit then. There was heroin and other drugs, but I think that the real large movement of drugs started probably in the later 60s and certainly deeply into the 70s. It was out of control.

 

HH: And so what was the city's relationship with the rest of the state? Again, Detroit was a place you'd go to if you were in Ann Arbor for a night, or a weekend. It was a place to go and come back from, not to stay, or to drive through on your way to somewhere else, up to the, you know, up to the UP, wherever you're going.

 

DM: Yeah.

 

HH: When did that disconnect occur?

 

DM: Well, I think in the period that I'm writing about, it wasn't as pronounced as it would certainly become. You know, dividing, the traditional dividing line are the riots of 1967. And I think that's the most pronounced differentiation. It certainly was occurring over a period of, you know, things don't happen just spontaneously, so over the course of probably starting in the late 50s, I would say, and then most pronounced by the riots of '67.

 

HH: And did Vietnam and the fact that McNamara, I love that pull up your socks kind of guy anecdote, by the way. I mean, that's really a telling anecdote. How much does McNamara's run of the war cast a shadow on Detroit? That's reaching, I know, for a literary connection.

 

DM: Right.


HH: But his methods became the methods of Vietnam.

 

DM: Yes, they did, that he learned at the, you know, that he imposed at the Ford Motor Company fairly successfully sort of the turning everything into analytics and numbers. And you know, I don't have, I'm not, I'm also not, I can't claim to be an expert on cars. I do know a lot about Vietnam. I wrote a book about that, too, but I think that sort of McNamara's sensibility certainly carried over from the Ford Motor Company to the Pentagon, and not for the better.

 

HH: Not for the better.

 

--- - - --

 

HH: If you want to read the story about Mary Wells and My Guy, you're going to have to read the book, Once In A Great City: A Detroit Story. It's linked at Hughhewitt.com by David Maraniss, associate editor at the Washington Post and author of many great bestsellers. Once In A Great City is, I hope, somebody's inspired to do the same thing for Cleveland, but I don't think it's got the same kind of Shakespearian arc to it. A closing question, David Maraniss, this is a short segment. President Kennedy launched the Peace Corps at U. of M. LBJ went back and he launched the Great Society. Now the Peace Corps is not a failure.

 

DM: Right.

 

HH: My college roommate, Mark Gearan, ran it for a while. It's done great work. But the Great Society failed. Tom Hayden launched the SDS out of Michigan in Port Huron. It failed. They all failed. Did Michigan give up the essential element of its greatness, which was capitalism and free enterprise? Is that where it went wrong?

 

DM: I don't, that question is too big for me, Hugh. I mean, to be honest, I could give a superficial answer, but I think it's much more complicated than that. But certainly, I end the book with Lyndon Johnson's speech, because it's such a wistful moment where the characters in the book don't know what's coming, but we all do.

 

HH: Right.

 

DM: And it is that failure to meet the hopes and promises of that moment.

 

HH: Well, you also end with a Venn Diagram. It's fascinating, this Venn Diagram, everybody is connected in a city that works, and no one is connected in a disaster.

 

DM: You know, well, they're all part of the disaster in the end, but that diagram was just something I used to help me write the book. And my editor saw it and said let's publish it. So you know…

 

HH: Good on him or her.

 

DM: A lot of the characters are pretty strong.

 

HH: And there's a little eulogy section, I won't even call it an epilogue, where you're walking along Woodward Avenue and it's empty, and you could read War and Peace and cross it. Hopefully, it doesn't, they've got everything, right? I don't know if they've got the gas that Ohio and Pittsburgh got, but they've got water, right? They still have everything that made it a great city.


DM: Yeah, they do have everything, and you know, I'm a journalist, I've been one my whole life. My philosophy is be optimistic, but always skeptical. And so I'm skeptical, but I do see a lot of energy in Detroit right now, and because they have so much, I think they can have some of it back again.


HH: Well, David Maraniss, congratulations. Once In A Great City: A Detroit Story, is in bookstores now. What's next, David? You've got pretty much the 60s covered.

 

DM: I think I'm done with the 60s, you're right, Hugh.

 

HH: So where, are you waiting for the next president? Is that it? You wrote a book about President Obama.

 

DM: Yeah, maybe so. Maybe so, yeah.

 

HH: All right, if you had to pick one right now who you'd want to write about, I mean, are you up to a Trump biography?

 

DM: No, I can't. I just can't swallow it. I'm sorry.

 

HH: (laughing) David Maraniss, thank you for joining us.
