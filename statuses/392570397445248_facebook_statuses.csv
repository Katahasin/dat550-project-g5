Adiba Nelson is one of our newest contributing writers! She spent much of her life feeling like ""other,"" but that all changed when she went to a plus-size fashion show for Portland Fashion Week. That show proved to be the catalyst for some life changing transformations in her life, and since 2013, she has dedicated herself to living unapologetically. She is opinionated and snarky, and maybe a hair sarcastic (maybe), but she is also breathtakingly honest, saying the things you want to say but can't, won't, and maybe sometimes shouldn't. She is a former social worker who now spends her days baking cupcakes, holding strangers' babies, and helping ants completes their hills (sarcasm). She is *actually* a staunch advocate for body positivity/size acceptance, disability rights, and women being in charge of their own lives. You can find her ranting on Huffington Post, MyBrownBaby, Tucson Weekly, and on her own blog, The Full Nelson (http://buff.ly/2kKYYuK). You can also find her popping pasties as the stage scorching burlesque performer, The BIG Bang McGillicuddy (http://buff.ly/2kL2KUN).  If you'd like a less rant-y, G-rated version of Adiba, check out her children's book Meet ClaraBelle Blue (http://buff.ly/2kLaciy).

Carmen Rios splits her time disparately between feminist rabble-rousing, writing, public speaking, and flower-picking. A professional feminist by day and overemotional writer by night, Carmen is currently Communications Coordinator at the Feminist Majority Foundation and the Feminism and Community Editor at Autostraddle.

Her successful work for over five years in digital feminism – ranging from Hollaback!'s successful launching Kickstarter campaign to the viral #EducateCoaches petition on Change – has earned her the titles of ""digital native,"" ""intimidating to some,"" and ""vapid and uninteresting.""

Marina Watanabe is an Everyday Feminism Social Media Associate & Contributing Vlogger. She's a vlogger (http://buff.ly/2gSi9NX), blogger, overenthusiastic tweeter, and frustratingly close to being a college graduate (like, SO CLOSE). Marina identifies as mixed-race Japanese-American, a bisexual woman of color, a feminist, and a Gryffinclaw. She is particularly passionate about speaking of issues of sexual harassment and rape culture, overlapping intersectional identities, and fighting mental health stigma. She is currently majoring in Women's Studies and Communications at Sacramento State and hopes to continue using social media as a tool to discuss and raise awareness for feminist and social justice issues. Aside from creating video content for Everyday Feminism, she hosts a YouTube series called Feminist Fridays that explores the social, the political, and the media from a feminist and intersectional perspective – and uses a lot of F-words. She also runs a Tumblr called Everyday Harassment (http://buff.ly/2gSenUL) that serves as a safe space for women and members of marginalized groups to share their stories and educate others on the nature and frequency of sexual harassment.

In this difficult time, it's even more important that we learn how to heal the pain caused by systemic oppression. This frees us from the pain and fear that would lead us to respond with dehumanization and retribution. And instead we can lead with love and justice.

To support you in this work, we're sharing the video recordings of two past Compassionate Activism online workshops -- ""Healing from Toxic Whiteness to Better Fight for Racial Justice"" and ""Healing from Marginalization through Love and Justice."" 

These workshops offer a framework to understand how to get in touch with your pain in a gentle, affirming way and some immediate tools to help you move from a place of fear to a place of action.    

We invite you to check them out and hope they're able to provide you support through the times ahead with a sense of wholeness and shared humanity.",Compassionate Activism: Healing from Toxic Whiteness and Marginalization,link,http://buff.ly/2g0hhFz,2016-11-18 14:00:47,145,9,44,129,13,0,3,0,0

People are becoming more aware of what's happening, but we haven't seen nearly as much media coverage as there should be - and this poignant explanation by Donney Rose shows why: 

""What needs to be understood is that there is a segment of our population that went from being met with aggression by a militarized police force last month to losing a great bit of what they own in this month's flooding. There are for real people who have been doubly victimized by governmental negligence, by state sanctioned violence and by infrastructural neglect based on zip code.

This is what the phrase ""most vulnerable"" means. It is when classism makes you most susceptible to harm by man-made authority and/or natural harm that you don't get a barrier from. And by barrier I mean it is lazy to suggest that victims of breaking levies or poor drainage systems, are victims of God's will being done. Nah, they are by and large victims of the same disregard of life as victims of police violence, dictated by the same disproportionate use of tax dollars.

Which all has much less to do with divine dismissal of ""everything happening for a reason"" and more to do with exact reasons that everything seems to always happen to a specific populace.""

Marina Watanabe is a vlogger (http://buff.ly/2aUGQFb), blogger, overenthusiastic tweeter, and frustratingly close to being a college graduate (like, SO CLOSE.) Marina identifies as mixed-race Japanese-American, a bisexual woman of color, a feminist, and a Gryffinclaw. She is particularly passionate about speaking of issues of sexual harassment and rape culture, overlapping intersectional identities, and fighting mental health stigma. She is currently majoring in Women's Studies and Communications at Sacramento State and hopes to continue using social media as a tool to discuss and raise awareness for feminist and social justice issues. Aside from creating video content for Everyday Feminism, she hosts a YouTube series called Feminist Fridays that explores the social, the political, and the media from a feminist and intersectional perspective – and uses a lot of F-words. She also runs a Tumblr called Everyday Harassment (http://buff.ly/2aUGgYc) that serves as a safe space for women and members of marginalized groups to share their stories and educate others on the nature and frequency of sexual harassment.

But we really want to! So that's inspired us to think of ways to serve this need in a way that's sustainable for us. 

We'd like to know if you'd be interested in an interactive online membership program to help share advice and resources, take your intersectional feminism to another level, and build community for a small membership fee.

But we'll only offer this if a lot of you want to enroll in it! 

So please like this FB post if you want us to create it. And give us feedback on what would make it truly valuable and useful to you!

For example, do you have specific goals or challenges in your life that you'd like our advice and support? Possible topics could be how to incorporate more social justice practices into your work or personal life or develop a career in social justice.

Perks to the online membership program could include Q&A sessions with staff, social justice seminars and workshops, group discussions, and more.

This week, the Everyday Feminism staff is excited by: The internet's hilarious response to Melania Trump's plagiarism of Michelle Obama's speech

Why we love it: Oh, the RNC. I wouldn't exactly call the beginning of the Republican National Convention a ""win,"" but as for the internet's response to the discovery that Donald Trump's wife Melania repeated passages from First Lady Michelle Obama's 2008 speech? GOLDEN. 

Some people say focusing on this is a distraction from more pressing issues – like the overt racism and xenophobia that Republican leaders have expressed over the past few days. And it's true that it's important to keep the bigger picture in perspective. 

But personally, I appreciated the moment of levity that came with having some fun with this moment. And this has also brought some attention to an issue that's not trivial at all – the fact that Black women so often find our words and our work repeated by and credited to other people more accepted by mainstream society. 

It's no laughing matter. But in the spirit of the long tradition of laughing to keep from crying, many have spun this moment into comedy gold with some hilarious memes and hashtags like #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes. Here are some of the funniest ones people came up with. Enjoy!

This week, the Everyday Feminism staff is excited by: Jesse Williams and Shonda Land!

WHY WE LOVE IT: If you missed actor Jesse Williams' speech at the BET Awards, please check it out now – this is a message that needs to be spread far and wide. 

I could hardly control my excitement over this incredible truth-telling on national TV. If you follow me on Twitter or Tumblr, I ain't sorry for blowing up your feed with quotes and gifs and more during this moment – it had to be done. 

While accepting a Humanitarian Award, Jesse brought us face-to-face with some uncomfortable – but deeply important – truths about racism, violence, and everyday people's roles in it.

Typically, there's now backlash against him. A growing petition is calling for Jesse to be fired from his role on Grey's Anatomy – but the people signing it don't know who they're dealing with. In a single tweet, showrunner Shonda Rhimes shut down all that noise, saying, ""Um, people? Boo don't need a petition. #shondalandrules"".

And I just LOVE this moment of passionately pursuing justice in the face of opposition – AND the fact that we've got a Black woman who's fought her way to such an influential position in the media, that she can laugh the haters off and do what's right. It doesn't always seem possible to break these barriers. But Shonda's done it, Jesse's right there with her, and I'm inspired by the doors they're opening for more and more people to unapologetically proclaim that BLACK. LIVES. MATTER.

This week, the Everyday Feminism staff is excited about: The Supreme Court ruling that upholds tribal jurisdiction to support Native survivors!

Why we love it: Do you know about the crisis of violence against Native women and children? 4 in 5 Native Americans have been raped, stalked, or abused in their lifetime, and 1 in 3 Native women has been raped, stalked, or abused in the past year alone – almost all by someone who is not Native.

So in the recent Supreme Court case Dollar General vs Mississippi Band of Choctaws, a ruling against the tribe would have meant that no American Indian Nation would be able to try any civil case involving a Non-Native person or corporation – the most damaging decision to the rights of Native people in over half a century. 

Instead, the Supreme Court tied in a 4-4 decision – so the lower court ruling in favor of the tribe stands!

Read a moving statement on this case from Force: Upsetting Rape Culture and The Monument Quilt, along with an infographic that shows just how much was at stake, here: http://buff.ly/294qmwu

With 30 awesome experts (including Sonya Renee Taylor from The Body Is Not an Apology, Dan Maldonado and Jaden Fields from T-Ffed: Trans Folx Fighting Eating Disorders , and our very own Co-Managing Editor, Melissa A. Fabello), you're bound to learn something new. So if you're interested in learning more about feeling peaceful around food, having amazing sex, navigating the healthcare system, and more, you can sign up to receive the video series here: http://thequeerbodyloveseries.com/mfabello

This week the Everyday Feminism staff is honoring: QTPOC spirit, resistance, and resilience after the tragedy in Orlando

Why we love it: This week, it feels hard to celebrate a ""win."" The attack on Latin night at a Pulse, an Orlando LGBTQ nightclub, has all of my attention, and I am crushed. 

I'm a queer Black woman, and dancing with other LGBTQIA+ people of color is hands down one of my favorite things to do in the entire world. This was an attack on a sacred space, and the way I'm feeling now is a lot like how I felt in the immediate aftermath of the shooting at a Black Charleston church. Numb. Terrified. Devastated. 

And it's only thanks to LGBTQIA+ POC community that I don't feel defeated. We're making it possible for each other to heal, to do what feels nearly impossible in continuing to live our lives after such unspeakable tragedy. 

I've seen art and poetry, odes to the sanctity of ""Latinx night at the gay club,"" a time for celebration and joy and love we can only find by resisting white supremacy and heteropatriarchy, reconnecting with indigenous and spiritual and embodied wisdom that we carry in our bodies and spirits.

I've read the words of unimaginably resilient queer and trans Muslims refusing to be silent or invisible or forgotten. There have been vigils, healing circles, and loving check-ins between LGBTQIA+ people of color who recognize one another's pain. 

Yes, we're also speaking with allies, discussing policy changes, and calling out politicians and other leaders responsible for our social norms and institutions that other and criminalize LGBTQIA+ people of color, immigrants, and Muslims. These actions have an important place in the movement.

But truth be told, we can only get through this because we have each other. We don't need fake allies, and we're not begging for validation from people who dehumanize us every day. 

We're creating our own space in the world by standing together, prioritizing our own healing, and honoring the inherent, undeniable value of the people we've lost and those of us who are still here. 

As the proudly Black bisexual poet June Jordan once wrote, ""We are the ones we have been waiting for."" Thank you, LGBTQIA+ people of color, for being here with me. -Maisha Z. Johnson, Staff Writer & Digital Content Associate

It's all the more heartbreaking for this to happen during Pride month – a time when we celebrate our communities and remember that, in a world with so much hatred for who we are, it is a fiercely political act of resilience to find our joy.

We remember that in moments like this, the most vulnerable people are those living at the intersections of multiple marginalized identities. This attack happened in an LGBTQ nightclub, on a Latinx night. So the impact is especially difficult for Latinx folks in LGBTQIA+ communities.

There are also LGBTQIA+ Muslim people who are hurting right now. After an attack by someone who calls themselves a Muslim, or is even suspected to be a Muslim, incidents of Islamophobic violence, discrimination, and criminalization rise against innocent Muslim people.

In the midst of this terrible attack, we're also reeling from the routine criminalization of LGBTQIA+ people of color, deportations and abusive detentions of LGBTQIA+ immigrants, horrific violence targeting trans women of color, anti-trans legislation in places like North Carolina, and more.

So, though we still have much to celebrate this Pride month, we remember that we still have a lot to fight for. Systems including homophobia, transphobia, patriarchy, white supremacy, and more are taking our lives, as the video below highlights.

Why we love it: A black man named Timothy Foster was sentenced to death in 1987 - in a ridiculously blatant example of racial discrimination. We know a single case couldn't possibly erase the whole tragic impact of racism in the criminal justice system, but we all need to be paying attention to moments like this - and urging those in power to follow this lead. 

Can you imagine waiting 30 years in prison for a moment like this? We can't undo the injustices of the past, but we can insist on taking a new path. -Sandra Kim, Founder & Executive Director

Why we love it: This week's win is brought to you by these nine plus-size androgynous babes.

Androgyny is typically presented as white, thin, and conventionally attractive – these gorgeous humans defy these ideals and they do it with killer style. 

Androgyny, contrary to mainstream belief, is for any and all bodies. Fat bodies, black and brown bodies, disabled bodies, queer bodies. Androgyny is more than Ruby Rose; androgyny is more than Tilda Swinton. Androgyny is as varied as the people who embrace it.

As a genderqueer and chunky cutie myself, I am SO here for diverse representations of androgyny. They help us to dream of what's possible for ourselves, and help us to feel validated and whole in our bodies.

While this list certainly doesn't cover the full spectrum of androgynous people, it's a great place to start. I hope you find as much joy in it as I did. -Sam Dylan Finch, Editorial Associate & Feature Writer

This week the Everyday Feminism staff is excited by: Co-Editor Jezebel Delilah X's fundraiser for her upcoming theatrical production, Congregation of Liberation Presents: Black Rage//Black Magic (http://buff.ly/23WBEVT)

Why we love it: The production of Black Rage//Black Magic is the result of a 16 week theatrical healing workshop that I, Jezebel Delilah X, co-facilitated with my creative partner, Tha HoodAlkemist, for Black people in the Bay Area FOR FREE. The workshop created a safe space for participants to use playwriting, theatre games, ritual, and conversation to move through their rage, pain, heartbreak, and trauma as a result of constantly experiencing anti-black racism (and other intersectional oppressions) in their personal lives, and witnessing it so horrifically in unending display of police/systemic violence broadcasted in our communities and on the media. 

Within the workshop, participants and facilitators created a series of short plays and performance art pieces centered around their Black Rage and the magical ways we heal and move through it. The production will be June 1st and 2nd at SAFEhouse Arts in San Francisco (http://buff.ly/23WBOwv).

As a bullied kid, it was theatre that saved my life, that helped me move from being angry at, and afraid of, the world into a fierce determination to create change, to fight for social justice and healing, and to knowing that I am just as valuable and important as every one else. It was theatre that kept me alive, that helped me love myself, and that helped me learn to love others. While contemporary racism consistently works to set people of color back, while blaming us from our struggles, theatre is a phenomenal way to fight back, to speak up, and to remind each other of our collective beauty, our powerful self-efficacy, and the glory of our resilience. Theatre is a magical wand that can nurture self esteem, healing, and community in the face of any bully - including racism.

I could really use any and all help in this venture - we want to pay our participants and produce more free workshops in community. Please check out our fundraising video, and if you feel moved please support our campaign by donating to it and sharing it with your friends (http://buff.ly/23WBEVT).

This week the Everyday Feminism Staff is excited by: Mental Health Awareness Month

Why we love it: May is Mental Health Awareness Month! There are always plenty of reasons to talk about mental health, but having a whole month dedicated to it gives me hope that we can create the space to support each other in our struggles.

I deal with anxiety, depression, and trauma from sexual and intimate partner violence – a beast of a combination. It's a real struggle, and sometimes I feel so ashamed, like I'm just a failure and the only one who's feeling this way.

So I'm immensely grateful for people who speak out about their mental health struggles and let me know that I'm not alone. This year, I've been especially thankful for people discussing mental health from an intersectional perspective, recognizing that we all have unique challenges.

Because, while mental illness affects people of all backgrounds, we don't all have the same experience. Men, for example, have the burden of being told it's not okay to express their emotions. People of color often struggle to find service providers who understand the stigma in our communities. Queer, trans, and gender non-conforming can face medical professionals who demonize their identities.

So here's one of my favorite celebrations of Mental Health Awareness Month: MayBeWell's collection of 2-minute videos on mental health in the Black community. There is far too much silence about mental health in my community, but with one video being released for each day of May, I'll have lots of voices to remind me that I'm not alone. -Maisha Z. Johnson, Staff Writer and Digital Content Associate

This week the Everyday Feminism staff is excited by: #UnfairAndLovely

Why we love it: The Unfair and Lovely campaign is simply GORGEOUS – dark-skinned South Asian women telling colorism to GTFO of their lives and self-image by celebrating their dark skin tones. 

I'm a Black woman with dark skin, so I know colorism well – the pressure to lighten your skin, the back-handed compliment that says you're ""pretty for a dark girl."" So I LOVE that this campaign started when a Black woman, Pax Jones, took photos of sisters Mirusha and Yanusha Yogarajah, who are of Sri Lankan descent. They decided to post the pictures with the hashtag #UnfairAndLovely – and encourage dark-skinned women of all backgrounds to reject the global colorism phenomenon by sharing their own selfies and celebrations of dark skin. 

Along with hashtagslike #ReclaimtheBindi, which pushes back against cultural appropriation of South Asian symbols, and other anti-colorism campaigns like #FlexinMyComplexion and #IwillNotApologizeforBeingDarkSkin, this social media movement shows how we can use digital tools and our own images to reject the systems trying to keep us down. 

Sending all my love and solidarity to South Asian women and all of us who are unfair and lovely – no matter what the media or anyone else says.

This week the Everyday Feminism staff is excited by: an open, honest look at fatphobia and disordered eating with a subtle feminist message in Mona Awad's ""13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl.""

Why we love it: Most literary books that cover intersections of fatphobia, disordered eating, and diet culture tend to either do so in a way that's harmful and triggering or awkwardly over-the-top in its feminist delivery, leaving us unfulfilled. But Mona Awad's new book, ""13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl"" manages to have these conversations in an honest, raw, and nuanced way – without falling into the common traps of the genre. These thirteen stories come together to illustrate the ups and downs in the life of Lizzie, exploring the various ways that fat, food, and fitness shape our lives. According to The Washington Post, by the time the subtle, brilliant message is spelled out at the end of the novel, ""You'll want to grab a friend and say: 'Whoa. This. Exactly.'"" And I couldn't agree more. - Melissa A. Fabello, Co-Managing Editor

This week the Everyday Feminism staff is excited by: the incredible leadership and activism of the Black youth who kicked Anita Alvarez out of office in Chicago.

Why we love it: Following former Chicago prosecutor Anita Alvarez's decision not to charge former police officer Jason Van Dyke with the murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald until a year after the murder and only when the video of the murder that she and other officials worked to bury came to light, Black youth activists and those in solidarity with them have finally succeeded in ousting Alvarez from office. 

As BBC reporter Jessica Lussenhop writes, ""The Black Lives Matter movement has been criticised for its lack of focus, aversion to a hierarchical structure, and inability to translate rage from street protests into tangible political goals... But [March 16th's] results answered those criticisms with definitive proof of the movement's real political clout.""

This victory shows us all that the future of our world lies squarely and powerfully in the hands of our young people of color, hands that have and will continue to usher in justice in the face overwhelming odds. - Sandra Kim, Founder and Executive Director

The recent news that one of the biggest and most heinous players in the global prison industrial complex, G4S, will be selling their Israeli subsidiary, and getting out of the U.S. and U.K. youth prison businesses within the next two years.   

Why we love it: 

After years of campaigning for justice, the global #BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement has finally succeeded in pushing the British private ""security"" company G4S out of Israel, a company that's served as a key agent in Israel's abuse and torture of its 7,000 Palestinian prisoners (many of them children as young as 11 years old). 

This victory extends beyond Palestine, as the announcement made by G4S included the news that they will be exiting out of US ""youth justice services"" and UK ""children's services"" -- detention centers known for their abuse of children, particularly children of color. 

As Jewish Voice for Peace Executive Director Rebecca Vilkomerson put it, ""This win shows the power of building coalitions in solidarity with one another based on a common principle - challenging mass incarceration and racist policing whether it is happening in the US, UK, or Israel."" 

And as Adv. Sahar Francis, Director of Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association noted: ""The latest reports that G4S will sell its subsidiaries in Israel is welcome news but this has no immediate effect on those facing human rights violations inside Israel's prisons today.""

There is still much work to be done, and we look forward to the continued success of all movements for peace and justice. 

- Josette Souza, Program Coordinator

Why we love it: As a suicide attempt survivor, I have found myself feeling completely alone as I navigate life after my attempt. That's why I want to share this project, which is a collection of portraits, accompanied by stories, of suicide attempt survivors.

The project, founded by the amazing Dese'Rae L. Stage, has filled me with so much affirmation in a society which often erases and invisibilizes the experiences of survivors. The portraits are not only beautiful, but the stories that go along with them are touching, at times heartbreaking, and shed a light on a community that is seldom acknowledged.

Dese'Rae, thank you for the incredible work that you do. I knew that I wasn't alone in my experiences – but your project is proof that we can and we do live through this.

This week the Everyday Feminism Staff is excited by Queer, Black Organizer Ashley Williams. 

Why we love them: On February 24th, 2016, Ashley attended a $500 plate dinner fundraiser for Hillary Clinton, reminded the world that she has publicly called Black youth ""Super Predators,"" and asked her to apologize to Black people for Mass Incarceration. As Hillary's supporters booed, insulted, hissed, and escorted Ashley out of the building, Hillary dismissed their presence and concerns by saying, ""ok, back to the issues...."" As if promoting and instigating the blatantly racist mass incarceration of predominately poor and working class Black people - a political movement that continues to rip apart families, lives, and communities -- is not an issue for a major presidential candidate.

Well, Ashley, despite those boos, hisses, and insults you had to endure, I want you to know that I am so proud of you and so grateful for your courage. Your activism and organizing is clearly rooted in a bravery fortified by self and community love. You, and your work, embody what hope and a belief in the possibility of change can look like. I would have loved to witness Hillary take this wonderful opportunity you offered her to show us that she can and will be accountable to racial justice, that change is possible, and that she honors the voices of the people. This would have been the perfect time for her to demonstrate that people can grow, learn, and heal from the socializations of white supremacy, that political candidates can be honest, self-reflective, and accountable allies for their more marginalized constituents - and not money hungry politicians exploiting the racialized pain, trauma, and oppression of people of color for more power and a political platform. 

You, Ashley, are a hero and I am honored by your existence. If Hilary does become our next president, I wish her the courage, the grace, and the love for community and justice that you displayed at her fundraising dinner. Thank you for your commitment to liberation.

Why we love it: 11-year-old activist Marley Dias has touched my whole heart and soul by launching #1000BlackGirlBooks – a drive to collect 1,000 books with black girl protagonists. As a black girl book nerd, I had to laugh when Marley explained that she's tired of always reading about ""white boys and dogs."" Even as a dog lover, I remember that exact frustration from my childhood. 

And I'm apparently not alone in being moved – Marley reached her goal! She's collected over 1,000 books and the donations are still pouring in. She plans to send them to US and Jamaican schools, helping more children find vital affirmation in stories that reflect their lives. I'm sure this isn't the last we'll hear from Marley Dias – so be on the lookout for this inspiring leader in #BlackGirlMagic!

This week the Everyday Feminism staff is excited by: ""Juliet Takes a Breath"" by Gabby Rivera. 

Why we love it: 

Inga Muscio's review of this Gabby Rivera novel is 'Even if Holden Caulfield was born in the Bronx in the 1980s, he could never be this awesome' – and as a big fan of ""Catcher in the Rye,"" I wasn't so sure it would live up to this hype. But this book was a hugely pleasant surprise, and I couldn't put it down. Following the story of a baby-queer Latina navigating feminism (and encountering situations that help explain concepts like white feminism and polyamory to the reader), Rivera creates palpable struggles through vivid characters and gorgeous prose. Even Roxane Gay tweeted about how brilliant this book is. And if that's not a good enough reason to pick up a copy, then let me add my promise to you: You won't regret it. - Melissa Fabello, Co-Managing Editor

These attacks were horrendous violations of women's bodies and the survivors absolutely deserve support. But we've also noticed a trend amongst those calling for justice in this particular instance - that many of them are people who ordinarily dismiss rape culture, such as conservatives and anti-feminists like Fox News. 

And while we agree wholeheartedly that justice needs to happen, something's very off about this call for justice – namely, that it's rooted in xenophobia and Islamophobia. The right wing is using this specific incident of sexual violence to whip up support for anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies as if only Muslim men commit sexual violence. 

So let's be clear, sexism is embedded in every culture. We need to work year round to dismantle rape culture and end sexual assault regardless of who is targeted and who perpetrates them - including and especially within each of our own communities. 

Because as this author writes, ""You know what has never yet prevented sexual violence? Unbridled racism.""

If you still know of people who claim that the overall attitude of the police toward Black people and their shooting of unarmed Black people is not rooted in racism, please share this with them.

Last night, a group of white men - armed, masked, and wearing bulletproof vests - went to the crowd of peaceful unarmed Black protestors at the MN police station. This group had been coming on other nights so presumably the police knew their feelings (if it wasn't already clearly evident from their guns and gear) and still the police chose to not take any steps to protect the Black protestors. The white men then proceed to shoot into the crowd, wounding at least 5 Black people.

What do the police choose to do, especially given the fact that this happened only one block away from the police station that was filled with police officers? Let the white shooters leave and then fire a chemical irritant into the crowd of Black protestors (who had just been shot at). This isn't surprising unfortunately since the police have also been the other group of white people pointing guns at them during their non-violent protest.  

If the stark contrast between how the very same police chose to respond to this group of armed white men compared to the group of unarmed Black people who were being threatened with guns and being shot at doesn't scream of white supremacy to you, then wake the fuck up and ask yourself why you're trying so damn hard to protect and defend white people who shoot Black people!!",White supremacists shoot 5 Black Lives Matter activists protesting Jamar Clark's killing in...,link,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/11/white-supremacists-shoot-5-black-lives-matter-activists-protesting-jamar-clarks-killing-in-minneapolis/,2015-11-24 10:48:27,1527,77,1209,1527,0,0,0,0,0

Sign here: http://act.weareultraviolet.org/sign/syrian_refugees/?source=uv_website

As Ultraviolet writes, 

""Last Thursday, the House of Representatives--including 47 Democrats--approved an extreme measure to effectively shut down the refugee program for Syrians fleeing ISIS.

Three-fourths of Syrian refugees are women and children--and none of the identified terrorist attackers in Paris were Syrian refugees. This reeks of the reckless fear-mongering that led us into the war in Iraq.

Twelve-year-old girls are being systematically raped by ISIS--it's part of their strategy to terrorize the Syrian population. We won't defeat extremism in Syria by turning our backs on families and survivors of rape and violence who are trying to flee the very terrorists we fear. We can still stop this horrible bill in the Senate, but we need to stand together strongly. Will you sign the petition?""

Unfortunately, the people in France are experiencing now what is too often the daily reality in many countries. Places where people cannot walk around in their own communities without fear of similar random attacks, such as in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, the Dominican Republic, and beyond – including communities facing terror and interpersonal violence without support or media recognition. This is an incomplete list of examples and we extend wishes for peace and healing to people facing violence everywhere.

As the American government and people rightly offer their support to France, let us not forget how the American government and its foreign policy are a driving factor in the daily terror experienced in other countries. When we see news reports of this violence, will you extend the same compassion and understanding you have for the innocent people hurt and killed in France to the innocent people hurt and killed in the Middle East?

And as we show our support for the French people suffering the direct impact of these attacks, let's not forget the millions of refugees fleeing harrowing violence in their own home countries. When they show up in your country, will you demand they be treated with dignity and be provided the safety and support they need?

We also know, unfortunately, that after attacks such as this, some people wrongly join the cycle of violence with xenophobia and Islamophobia. When those around you blame refugees and Muslim people and call for violence against them in retaliation, how will you help humanize the innocent people being falsely characterized as ""the enemy""? 

And when Black Americans protest against police violence and are killed and beaten with impunity in their homes, playgrounds, schools, and neighborhoods, will you speak out too? 

We ask that you do, because nobody should have to live in fear. 

Nobody.

And we shouldn't have forces like racism and neo-colonialism direct our empathy for us – to a Western world that feels familiar, but not to Beirut, not to Baghdad. 

Let us not join in the cycle of violence – let's instead hold each other in peace and empathy during this time. 
Let us use this moment of compassion to show solidarity with everyone else who knows this fear and sadness.
Let us not feel helpless in the face of such random acts of violence. Let's instead begin to look out for each other – in our own homes and communities, across our country and the world.",,status,,2015-11-14 12:33:25,13389,332,6335,13389,0,0,0,0,0
