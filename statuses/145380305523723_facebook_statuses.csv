Elaine writes that Dr. Kathy Platoni (US Army, Retired) has been a tireless fighter for her fellow GI's since she entered the Army after graduating from college. As a psychologist, she was deployed numerous times to many of the most dangerous posts so that she could help those who were most in need. She served in the Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan, and at Guantanamo.

She was present when Major Hassan murdered many of her friends and colleagues in Texas, and has fought for proper recognition for our fallen heroes ever since (as a point of fact, she was in fact one of his intended victims because she has previously voiced her concern about him). Although now retired and in private practice, Kathy continues to advocate for our veterans whose emotional and mental needs are not being met by the government. In addition, she also serves with local (Dayton, Ohio) police departments to counsel victims as well as officers in crisis.

Dr. Platoni has published many articles and books related to PTSD and other battle-related illnesses, and still fights mightily for those whose voices are not being heard. I do not have a photo of Dr. Platoni, but I am sure that if you contacted her husband, Major John Hutchinson (USAF, Retired), he could provide you with one.

Heidi writes that First Lieutenant Fred Omar Pratt was born 17 August 1941. He was the son of Vern Hose Pratt and Edwin M. Pratt of Moorefield, WV. 1LT Pratt enlisted in the Army on 13 October 1958 and served a tour of duty in Japan and Korea. He was a distinguished graduate of the Airborne School and served as a Ranger in the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam during 1962, where he volunteered for the Special Forces and returned to the U.S. for training. After winning the Green Beret, he was appointed to attend Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, GA where he was elected to the honored position of Council of President of the Battalion and was named distinguished graduate of his class. Lt. Pratt then attended the Army's Rotary Wing Flight School and returned to Vietnam on 02 June 1968 as a C-Model Helicopter Gun Ship Pilot in the 155th Assault Helicopter Company, Ban Me Thuot, Central Highlands, RVN. On 23 August 1968, 1Lt. Pratt distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions while serving as pilot of a Huey helicopter gunship supporting friendly Special Forces and MACV compounds in the vicinity of Duc Lop that were under attack by an enemy regiment. Observing a treeline in which large enemy forces had concentrated, he began to attack the enemy force; in the course of which his aircraft sustained numerous hits. Undaunted, he continued his fierce attacks until his aircraft was shot down by the intense anti-aircraft fire. Although wounded in the arm and back, !Lt. Pratt survived the crash. The crew of the downed aircraft was immediately taken under fire by enemy mortars and automatic weapons fire. However, his concern was for his seriously injured crew chief. Gaining access to the outer perimeter of the compound, he again exposed himself to enemy fire to summon aid for his crew. Upon reaching the secure area, he continued to give aid to his wounded crew chief, refusing treatment for himself. On 26 August 1968, although he had been shot down and wounded only days before, he insisted on returning to the battle (the NVA had captured half the compound by this time). Arriving in the area, he began an attack on a large enemy force, from which he drew heavy fire. He responded by immediately placing a devastating volume of fire on the enemy position. During this one engagement alone he is credited with killing over 600 NVA. During the fierce exchange of fire, heavy enemy fire shattered his windshield and he was fatally wounded in the face. His copilot returned the shot up gunship to the 155th AHC field at Ban Me Thuot. For his courageous, gallant and aggressive action, 1Lt. Pratt was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action (Posthumous), the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism (Posthumous), the Air Medal with Seven Oak Leaf Clusters, the Purple Heart twice, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and two of the highest awards awarded by the Republic of Vietnam. In June 1974, the U.S.. Army dedicated the new Flight Simulator Building, Building 4901, at the U.S. Army Aviation School at Fort Rucker Alabama as Pratt Hall in honor of Omar. It houses the most sophisticated flight simulator systems used to train Army aviators. His Niece, Joye, stated: ""My Uncle, Omar, left behind a wife and three young sons. He was born in a small town called Moorefield, West Virginia where the rest of his brothers and sisters now reside."" I was proud to have served with 1Lt. Pratt in the 155th AHC, may he rest in peace and always be remembered by his fellow warriors. Bradley H. Petersen, Jr. Col. USA (Ret.)

Thank you Fred Pratt for your service.

My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security will continue to enforce all of President Trump's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. President Trump's Executive Orders remain in place—prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. President Trump's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.

Approximately 80 million international travelers enter the United States every year. Yesterday, less than one percent of the more than 325,000 international air travelers who arrive every day were inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented. These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders.

He tirelessly helped to shut down Homestead Air Force Base and helped secure millions of dollars of vehicles and assets belonging to the United States Government prior to the arrival of Hurricane Andrew. He risked his own life doing the mission as he was instructed to do. Prior to the assignment to Homestead, he was stationed in Kettering Ohio on a special duty assignment at Desi Air Base. He was part of an elite group of men and women delivering the message of importance of the military mission by way of a state of the art theater van, traveling all over the United States. When the mission ended he helped to close the unit and single-handedly disbursed assets and personnel and was the last one out the door, turned the lights out and locked the door. Another milestone in his career. There are many more missions that he accomplished throughout his career. Today he is a broken Veteran with many health issues that are directly related to or caused by the mission. He is a 100% disabled American Veteran. If he was asked today if he would do it all over again, despite his ailments, his comment would be ""Yes, I would do it all over again.""

He was sailing in the Indian Ocean to the Burma area with munitions, tanks and pack mules for the soldiers, aboard the S.S. Jose Navarro. On Christmas night 1943 his ship was hit by torpedoes from a German U-boat. As they were lowering the life boats a man was knocked into the water from the high side of the listing ship. The Captain stated that it was every man for himself but my father could see over the side that the man was badly hurt. So he dove over the side and kept the mans head above water until the life boat was lowered and then with help of the others they got him into a life board. My father as well as all the others aboard ship, including the injured man, survived and after a couple days adrift in the life boats, we're all rescued. They spent several weeks in India in a British resthome recovering and then were reassigned to new ships. This is just one of the amazing events that my father lived through during WWII.""

145380305523723_949096515152094,"Have you seen the news? The White House is celebrating the ability to filibuster and prevent a vote on the Iran Deal. Friends, I'm going to tell you one truth right now: a filibuster means denying the ability for our representatives to ratify the will of the people. 

Regardless of where you stand on the issue, you must recognize the fact that a vote on the Iran Deal shows President Obama, shows the world, and shows Iran where we as a country, not a single man, stand on the Iran Deal. A filibuster causes the voice of the people to get muddled in process. 

It's not about the veto, it's about the vote. 

The White House is trying to avoid a vote at all costs. Because they know a vote will show an overwhelming bipartisan majority wants to prevent the dangerous Iran nuclear deal from passing. A view representative of the millions of Americans that want to protect their children from nuclear Iran. 

This is the largest foreign policy issue we've faced recently and had dire consequences on our national security. This bad deal gives billions of dollars to the number one state-sponsor of terrorism, doesn't provide enough safe guards from Iran developing nuclear weapons, and at best puts it off for 10-15 years. 

Let me repeat, it's not about the veto, it's about the vote. 

This vote is everything and we must do everything in our power get it to a vote and to stop this bad deal. I need you to call these four Senators right now–tell them you want a vote, and you want them to vote against the deal:

Senator Cardin – (202) 499-6153

She stated, ""My Dad, Richard J. Smith, attended Morris Minnesota Senior High School, excelling both scholastically and in sports. After graduation, with war on the horizon, Dad managed to squeeze in a season pitching with the Minneapolis Millers AAA baseball team. His college time was cut short by the attack on Pearl Harbor. 

Dad entered general combat at Normandy, France in June, 1944, leading a machine gun platoon in Gen. George S. Patton's 3rd Army. Combat operations continued without letup through the Battle of the Bulge until assaults into Czechoslovakia by Dad's division effectively cut the Third Reich in half. Dad later commented that of his original company he was one of three men present for duty at the end. 

During the campaign, an action by my Dad, Richard Smith, typified the man. One night, an American machine gun team was knocked out and two wounded men were cut off by German machine gun fire. Dad crawled for a long distance, crossing a stream to reach the position. The two men were greatly distressed but Dad administered combat first aid and assured them that everything was going to be alright. He then evacuated each man one at a time, crawling with them on his back until they were safely inside U.S. lines. Dad then returned a third time to retrieve the crucial crew-served weapon. By that time the Germans were aware of what was happening and Dad himself became pinned down by heavy fire, forcing him to remain submerged in the streambed for a couple hours until he was able to make his escape. Dad's service that night was officially recognized with the Bronze Star with V Device. 

Dad received a battlefield commission from Sergeant to First Lieutenant, followed by Officer Candidate School. Decommissioning at the end of the Korean War as Captain, Dad continued serving his country as the Postmaster in Morris, Minn., where he had grown up, and retired as a Postal Inspector based out of Milwaukee, Wisc. at which time he moved to Tucson, Ariz. 

Dad enjoyed his family and was always committed to helping others. On many occasions, he expressed how blessed he was to capture such a beauty, both inside and out, in Barbara Smith, his wife of 60 years. Dad loved his four children, his country and his God. In my opinion, Dad was what being an American is all about!""
