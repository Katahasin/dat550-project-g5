54789869630_10155104415159631,"""Parton's image relies in equal measure on her obvious material success and her self-proclaimed 'hillbilly, white trash background.' She grew up in rural eastern Tennessee, in a mountainside shack without running water. Her mother and father married when they were fifteen and seventeen respectively, and had twelve children by the time her mother was thirty-five. Her father was a sharecropper, a situation she explains bluntly: 'That means we didn't own the land we lived on. We farmed it for somebody else in return for a share of the crop. In a hard land that is stingy about giving up much of a crop, that share doesn't come to a whole lot.'

Today, a life-size model of the little wooden shack stands inside Dollywood, a theme-park-cum-museum near the ridge where she grew up. Only a few visitors can fit inside at a time—each one no doubt wondering how such a large family could be created in a place affording such little privacy. Right outside, a kiosk sells giant, insulated souvenir mugs for $14.99, which can be refilled for free at soda stations around the park. That short walk from the cramped hovel to the Coca-Cola® Fill & Chill Zone is the American Dream, fizzily encapsulated.""

Middle-class children, no matter their race, are socialized to assume that bureaucratic systems should respond to their needs. Their parents give them the language skills, confidence, and support to engage their teachers as equals. . . . The bureaucracy responds favorably to the social resources that cultivated those skills in the first place. In contrast, the enrollment process I experienced at for-profit institutions never once assumed that I had been cultivated to navigate a complex bureaucracy. Neither was it assumed that I should develop such acuity. The phone call was short, about fourteen minutes. Unless I presented an objection to scheduling a campus tour, the enrollment officers guided the direction of the telephone conversation. The same was true of the campus tour. I had only to answer the enrollment officers' questions to move through the process successfully. Additionally, the information sheets I filled out upon my arrival were brief, requiring little writing.

The people who were helped the most, those enrolled in Medicaid or those who received generous subsidies on the insurance exchanges, were the least vocal, the least engaged, and the least likely to vote, which Republican governors and legislators were well aware of. After visiting Kentucky, where right-wing Republican Matt Bevin won the governorship in 2015, reporter Alec MacGillis explained the dramatic conservative tilt of eastern Kentucky and other impoverished counties in the New York Times. He wrote that 'the people who most rely on the safety-net programs secured by Democrats are, by and large, not voting against their own interests by electing Republicans. Rather, they are not voting, period. They have, as voting data, surveys and my own reporting suggest, become profoundly disconnected from the political process.' Republican politicians understood this all too well. When a top advisor to Senator McConnell was asked if Republicans in Kentucky were afraid of the electoral consequences of depriving health insurance to the approximately 500,000 people newly covered by Obamacare, he replied, 'People on Medicaid don't vote.'""

To pay for expanded health care to the poor, the ACA imposed a set of taxes that represented the most consequential redistribution of income, from the top to the bottom, that the United States has seen in half a century. The revenue raised by those taxes helped pay for a dramatic expansion and improvement of Medicaid, transforming it into what was in effect a single-payer system for the bottom half of the working class.

Mainstream feminists have often praised the workplace as the site of great gains for women and encouraged women to work and better the conditions of their workplaces through activism, professional organizations, and legal campaigns. These efforts have improved the lives of many women by offering them economic stability and opportunities once only open to men.

""But waged work is itself constricting and demanding—hardly liberation itself. As women have entered the workplace, the kinds of jobs they take have often declined in quality, paying less, demanding more, and becoming more unstable and restricting. Work does not foster independence or freedom when individuals cannot choose where they work or the conditions under which they do so. Placing work at the core of a feminist demand obscures work's problems and blinds us to life outside of it.""

Doors open at 6:30, and the discussion will start at 7. Come early to get a seat!

Predicting the future of work has become a popular activity in recent years. The robots are coming for our jobs, the prognosticators tell us. It's inevitable. It's already begun. Or wait, no, the robots are few and far between, it's the algorithms we should worry about. We've read hundreds of these stories. We know how they go. But the thing they all seem to gloss over is the question at the heart of this section: the question of politics. Which workers have power, and how do they wield it? Whose work is valued, and how much? Who is a member of the working class these days, and how is that likely to change? 

On Tuesday, February 21, we'll pose these questions and more. To defeat Trumpism, we will need to create an inclusive vision for work—and life—that appeals to the whole working class. Join us as we discuss what that might look like. Then at 10 p.m. we'll head around the corner to Camp Bar for work-themed karaoke. Need inspiration for what to sing?

A virulent misogynist is now president of the United States. He has bragged about sexually assaulting women, threatened to repeal abortion rights, and will refuse to protect transgender individuals from discrimination. His proposals to ban immigrants, reject refugees he deems ""terrorists,"" and cut federal climate spending will have serious consequences for everyone, especially women. And if he follows through on his promise to ""bomb the shit"" out of countries he deems his enemies, women abroad will suffer too.
 
Now, more than ever, feminists in the United States need the solidarity of women's movements across the country and abroad, sharing their experiences and strategies as a resource in the fight to come. Whether it is young mothers fighting Conservative austerity policies in the UK or Polish feminists defending their reproductive rights under a right-wing government, each of these movements show that gender oppression must be confronted as relentlessly as other kinds of oppression. Most importantly, they show that even when the space for radical politics constricts, we must do more than simply defend our gains—our movements must move forward and demand more, not only for women but for everyone.
 
Join Dissent magazine's editors and contributors to discuss the challenges feminists will face under a Trump presidency, and how our movements can fight back. 

Premilla Nadasen is an Associate Professor of History at Barnard College and author of Household Workers Unite: The Untold Story of African American Women Who Built a Movement (Beacon Press, 2015).

The tourist trade had persisted even as the coffins of the dead were carried through the square. But now it was different: everyone was in costume, and it had become hard to distinguish the amateurs from the professionals. There were would-be soldiers with uniforms and antique rifles, Cossacks with billowing pants, high boots, and swords, and girls dressed as village maidens of the past, in embroidered blouses and red beads. Many people were wearing blue and gold outfits. In a way it was touching, but it was also intolerably kitschy, as if Americans all decided one day to go around dressed as pilgrims. The overt theatricality gave the proceedings an air of insincerity that was the very opposite of Maidan's famous ocean of shining eyes.""

Part of how I approach these questions is through the lens of ""drapetomania,"" a term invented by Dr. Samuel Cartwright, a nineteenth-century hack scientist, who claimed that slaves that tried to run away were afflicted by this condition. When I first learned about drapetomania, it struck me as this fascinating case in which the very desire for freedom was pathologized, and placed within the realm of disorder. My little brother has been largely nonverbal for most of his life, and in the early stages of the writing process for that poem I kept coming back to a certain sector of the western philosophical tradition wherein—following Descartes and others—if one did not speak, one was not human. If you could not elaborate your thinking through spoken language then you were not a person. And then also because of my brother's blackness, he was not envisioned as a fully human person for any number of folks, but rather an object.

54789869630_919686278130176,"Sarah Jaffe's book NECESSARY TROUBLE: Americans in Revolt is out in August. On July 12 Nation Books and Dissent invite you to raise a glass and hear Sarah give a special advance reading from the book, along with readings from some of Sarah's favorite troublemakers—Melissa Gira Grant, E. Tammy Kim, Victoria Law, and Kate Aronoff.

Sponsored by Nation Books/The Nation Institute and Dissent magazine. 

Sarah Jaffe is a Nation Institute fellow and independent journalist. She is the cohost of Dissent of Dissent's Belabored podcast.
 
Melissa Gira Grant covers sexual politics and human rights. She's a columnist for Pacific Standard, and her reporting and commentary has appeared in The Nation, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, VICE, Wired, The Guardian, The Washington Post, and Dissent, among other publications. She's the author of Playing the Whore: The Work of Sex Work.

E. Tammy Kim writes journalism and essays. She's on the editorial staff of The New Yorker and previously worked in the web features department of Al Jazeera America. In a previous life, she was a social justice lawyer and rabble-rouser. 

Victoria Law is a freelance journalist who focuses on the intersections of incarceration, gender and resistance. Her first book, ""Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women,"" examines organizing in women's jails and prisons across the country. Her next book, tentatively titled ""Your Home is Your Prison,"" critically examines proposed ""alternatives"" to incarceration and explores creative and far-reaching solutions to truly end mass incarceration. She's also a proud parent of a NYC public high school student.

Kate Aronoff covers social movements, energy and the environment, and is the Communications Manager for the New Economy Coalition. Her writing has appeared in the New York Times, Jacobin, Rolling Stone, the Guardian, and Dissent, where she co-hosts Hot & Bothered, a podcast on the politics of climate change. Starting this summer, Kate will be a Schumann Fellow at In These Times.

About NECESSARY TROUBLE:

The United States is witnessing a moment of unprecedented political engagement and social activism. Pundits who once fretted about Americans' apathy have, in the last few years, born witness to uprisings and protests across the country: the growth of the Tea Party, the successful fight for a $15 minimum wage, #BlackLivesMatter, Occupy Wall Street, and the grassroots networks supporting presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders.
 
Regardless of political alignment, Americans are discovering the effectiveness of going beyond the ballot box for answers. They are making good, necessary trouble and, in doing so, they are boldly challenging who wields power in this country. Nation Institute fellow, co-host of Dissent's Belabored podcast, and independent journalist Sarah Jaffe has written the definitive book on these movements that are poised to permanently remake American politics: NECESSARY TROUBLE: Americans in Revolt—out from Nation Books on August 23!

""Necessary Trouble is American history at its freshest and most compelling. Sarah Jaffe traces the many ways—from left to right—that Americans have risen up in response to the country's ongoing takeover by the obscenely rich. Sometimes we have to make trouble, and, as Jaffe reports, we're pretty damn good at it!""—Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed

""History is filled with stories of rebellion—and not just history, as Sarah Jaffe shows. What we've too often lacked are reporters willing and able to weave one-day stories into meaningful fabric. Jaffe does just that, with depth and breadth and eloquence. Necessary Trouble is necessary reading, and Jaffe's arrival is something to celebrate.""—Laura Flanders, host and founder of The Laura Flanders Show

""While commercial media can't seem to turn away from the Trump circus or Hillary's emails, Sarah Jaffe follows America's new radicals. And in doing so, tells a far more consequential story—one that reveals our recent past and an alternative future. The most compelling social and political portrait of our age, Necessary Trouble should be mandatory for anyone who thinks justice is necessary.""—Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination

(Her previous book exposed the coercive methods by which North Carolina sought to control reproduction among poor women and women of color.) It is also a master work of research. Schoen even joined the National Abortion Federation in order to discuss medical techniques with providers. The fact that such a medical history is only being written now is in itself a confirmation of one of Schoen's important arguments: that the abortion rights movement has not always provided full and accurate medical information to the public. This is a challenging claim, one that the pro-abortion rights community needs to hear, but it also needs to be placed in context, because all social movement propaganda is constrained by the heat of its struggles.""

From 7–9, Belabored hosts Sarah Jaffe and Michelle Chen will be joined by Mark Engler to talk about his new book This Is an Uprising. From protests around climate change and immigrant rights, to Occupy, the Arab Spring, and #BlackLivesMatter, a new generation is unleashing strategic nonviolent action to shape public debate and force political change. We'll talk about the hidden art behind these outbreaks of revolt, and how the labor movement can use protest to create lasting change and a better future for workers. Bring a question for the Q&A if you'd like to be featured on the show.

From 9–late, we'll party over beers like the revolution already happened.

Read an excerpt from The Cosmopolites: http://www.newrepublic.com/article/123203/passport-bubble

About the book:

The buying and selling of citizenship has become a thriving business in just a few years. Entrepreneurs and libertarians are renouncing America and Europe in favor of tax havens like Singapore and the Caribbean. But as journalist Atossa Araxia Abrahamian discovered, the story of twenty-first-century citizenship is bigger than millionaires seeking their next passport.

When Abrahamian learned that a group of mysterious middlemen were persuading island nations like the Comoros, St. Kitts, and Antigua to turn to selling citizenship as a new source of revenue after the 2008 financial crisis, she decided to follow the money trail to the Middle East. There, she found that the customers of passports-in-bulk programs were the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, oil-rich countries that don't want to confer their own citizenship on their bidoon people, or stateless minorities who have no documentation.

In her timely and eye-opening first book, Abrahamian travels the globe to meet these willing and unwitting ""cosmopolites,"" or citizens of the world, who inhabit a new, borderless realm where things can go very well, or very badly.

""A perceptive, brilliantly reported investigation into the ways in which the forces of globalization are fundamentally changing the conceptualization and practice of nationality. This is that rare thing: a book filled with news.""—Joseph O'Neill, author of Netherland and The Dog

""Abrahamian's fluently told, fast-paced story takes her around the world ... A slim but powerful book of great interest to students of international law and current events.""—Kirkus Reviews

Two such policy proposals have recently been gaining traction on the left: a universal basic income, on the one hand, and a job guarantee on the other.

On November 9, as part of New Economy Week, Dissent, Jacobin Magazine, and the New Economy Coalition will bring together activists, journalists, and scholars to discuss these two proposals. Should the left champion jobs for all or advance a basic income as part of a broader anti-work politics? Can we do both? How should we as a society define and value work? And how can we as activists frame transformative demands that balance the constraints of our political moment with more utopian visions?

Jesse Myerson (activist and writer)
