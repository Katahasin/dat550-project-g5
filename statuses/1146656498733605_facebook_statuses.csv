Luckily, Hex has recovered and was able to give this inspiring interview about the incident and his desire for restorative justice outside of the judicial and prison systems. Despite turning himself into the Seattle Police Department, the shooter was released from custody and so far has not been charged with any crimes. This contrasts starkly with the mass arrest of 230 protesters at the inauguration, who are now facing sentences of up to ten years. This is the reality of our current moment: those guilty of the ""crime"" of protesting against fascism and capitalism face draconian prison sentences, whereas someone who intends to kill and severely injures an anti-fascist gets away with impunity.

The conference brought together black liberation, indigenous, anarchist, and anti-fascist groups to discuss and look back not only on past struggles for liberation, but to think and strategize about the path ahead. It's Going Down was lucky enough to be able to record some of the talks that took place. What follows is a presentation from the Black Women's Defense League of Dallas, Texas.

The talk itself discusses the group's overall project of confronting patriarchy, black liberation, training, and community empowerment. It also offers a feminist history of the black liberation movement and presenters argue that without attacking patriarchy, the black liberation movement itself will not be able to confront and destroy white supremacy.""

""What gives us power is not the level of preparation of a clique of experts in destruction. Power is found in the common, in the sharing of our subversive relationship with the world. As long as the anarchist project presents itself as an individual undertaking, even through an affinity group, it remains at most liberalism, no matter how radical. If the insurrection is not a concept, it's also not the project of individuals in struggle. Power is the feeling to be part of a force that surpasses us, that transcends us, that defines us just as much as we define it. It's not in social movements that we look for it, but rather in insurrectional moments. It is in these we understand the irremediably common aspect of the struggle, that the will to attack the police and capitalism is shared by all those who take part in it, that we recognize between friends.

The point is that those ""Abolitionists"" of the 19th century didn't attempt to destroy the state, only the institution of chattel slavery, but left the oppressive government intact, thereby allowing the state to continue slavery as enacted by the 13th Amendment, denying the right of individuals to hold Blacks in slavery, but allowing the state the right to enslave anyone.

Today, there are those who call themselves ""Abolitionists,"" even some anarchists. But there are other anarchists who have begun to use the term ""Demolitionists"" instead, and for good reason.""",Abolitionist or Demolitionist?

In addition to taking the streets, general strikes also freeze production and profit-making, as workers cease to work across all workplaces in a given city or country, simultaneously. The result is more powerful than any boycott or demonstration: daily life is suspended in midair as factories, shops and transport shut down, and everything is up for grabs.

In this situation, police generally try to repress the strike and force crowds off the streets and back to work. They attack demonstrations and secure capitalist property, and coordinate closely with economic and political elites who are thrown into panic. But in many cases, police repression alone is not enough to quell such a massive mobilization. The longer the strike goes on, the more police control over territory and daily life begins to erode.""",What Happens to Cops in a General Strike? - IT'S GOING DOWN,link,https://itsgoingdown.org/happens-cops-general-strike/,2017-02-24 21:45:11,32,0,17,29,1,1,0,0,1
1146656498733605_1360022407397012,"""We can't help but think that people who say this haven't had much experience dealing with the police. The actions of the police in Standing Rock provide a good example. The anti-DAPL protests have been largely within the tradition of nonviolent civil disobedience and yet the resisters there have been brutally attacked with pepper spray, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, tear gas and batons. They've been encircled by drones, investigated by police, and tracked on social media. Clearly, the police weren't waiting for so-called ""violence"" to erupt before attacking. On the other hand, the demonstrators at UC Berkeley who shut down Milo's speech threw barricades, used mace against white supremacists, shot fireworks and threw stones at the police and the building where Milo was speaking, and lit fires in the street. The police response was to hide in the building and then stay to defend campus as the crowd was able to march largely unaccompanied by police for hours. What these examples highlight is not the superiority of one tactic or kind of tactic over another, but rather the importance of understanding the particulars of each situation, the goals, and what it makes sense to do. If you are truly worried about police violence, in a situation where the police have relatively few numbers, running towards them to make them flee is a greater guarantee of preventing police violence than sitting down and waiting for them to amass their weapons. Those who most often make the above claim are ideological pacifists, who push the doctrine of civil disobedience in every scenario, even when it is strategically dangerous; protest organizers and their marshals who have a vested interest in keeping their grant money and being allowed to obtain more permits; and the police themselves, who obviously don't want to be strategically out-maneuvered.""",Don't Just Follow Along: Some Critical Notes on Tactics and Discourse - IT'S GOING DOWN,link,https://itsgoingdown.org/dont-just-follow-along-critical-notes-tactics-discourse/,2017-02-24 21:43:47,64,0,28,60,3,0,1,0,0

As fissures within the state begin to yawn, these projects will become all the more vital. They need to be coordinated, of course, otherwise they are likely to be redundant or, worse, act at cross-purposes. But they certainly need not be centralized under a single organizing body; the value of dual-power institutions is that they are flexible and, given such flexibility, can permit the emergence of these productive divisions and subsequent reorganization around new projects.

Resistance in and of itself is a beautiful thing because it shows that people are still alive, they still consider themselves a part of their environment; on the other hand, resistance is by no means a synonym for change. The State has long known how to manage resistance, and how to factor it in as one more cost of its policies. For that reason, rather than being self-congratulatory when we resist, we should encourage one another to understand just what it is we are fighting back against, what it would take to defeat it, and how our actions measure up to the requirements of the situation.""",Long Term Resistance: Fighting Trump and Liberal Co-option - IT'S GOING DOWN,link,https://itsgoingdown.org/long-term-resistance-fighting-trump-liberal-co-option/,2017-02-20 15:11:17,33,1,24,33,0,0,0,0,0

In doing so, their actions are stripped of all reasons for acting and they are reduced to beings with animalistic urges; devoid of purpose other than being out of control.

We see this time and time again. When riots break out, elites always make the distinction that those that are physically fighting are not protesters and therefore are not legitimate. This is also how the black bloc is largely presented by the powers that be, as a body of people both in treason against the ""peaceful protester"" and also against whiteness itself.

The relations between Sheikh Maqsoud and Efrid Canton with non-PYD armed groups around Aleppo has been complicated, but even if we can accept some of these maneuvers, how can we accept that a revolutionary project has been content to watch another be crushed right in front of it? How can we explain that a movement based on the spread of directly democratic assemblies fought to opportunistically seize territory that had been held by other popular decision-making structures, the dozens of local councils that existed in Aleppo? Wouldn't a truly revolutionary position involve encouraging the autonomy of other areas, not monopolizing power and striking alliances of convenience with authoritarians?

Michigan prisoners continue to show that they are highly organized and capable pulling off mass demonstrations that shake the Michigan prison system. This time, they showed they are capable of doing so in coordination with prisoners on a national level.

Their actions have had serious consequences. All the prisoners at Kinross, whether or not they were involved in the uprising, were left out in the rain for hours with their arms zip tied behind their backs. Since the uprising, three inmates have died or been murdered in questionable circumstances in the Michigan prison system: one from an alleged overdose, one after being tased by guards, and a third possibly as a result of medical neglect. Although we cannot say for sure that these deaths are a form that repression for the strike is taking, it is a very real possibility and one that we as supporters must keep our eyes on.""","""It Is In Losing We Gain"": Reflections on the September 10th Kinross Prison Uprising - IT'S GOING DOWN",link,https://itsgoingdown.org/losing-gain-reflections-september-10th-kinross-prison-uprising/,2016-10-20 14:21:25,5,0,25,5,0,0,0,0,0

Hundreds gathered to shut down and take over 2 active construction sites, that despite the Obama administration's previous intervention, hailed as a victory for the encampment, continue to lay down and weld the pipelines on the route. As the warriors approached the first site, singing, drumming and war crying, the private security firm hastily packed up and left the site, allowing the group to conduct a powerful ceremony for the Water and its protection. This ceremony was conducted at both active construction sites, with prayer ties and trees planted in the direct route of the pipeline.

On the one hand, over the last few years multiple anarchist and other militant groups have been building deliberately and concertedly: some cutting their teeth in the streets, others in discussions and organizing projects. Regardless of the strategy, the important point is that these groups are all coming up under the banner of revolution: their purpose is to act on whatever front is available and most efficacious in the moment, towards the final goal of total annihilation of the status quo. On the other, the state itself is digging its own grave. With every egregious act of violence and every dismissed conviction of a killer cop, they affirm to those watching that their sole purpose is the maintenance of oppressive relations and institutions. The wider acknowledgement of the irredeemable nature of the contemporary plantation was evidenced in the recent occupation of City Hall Park, which was held under the banner of police abolition, rather than the typical liberal promotion of reformation.""",NYC Anarchist Action Communique: A Fire The Cannot Be Contained - IT'S GOING DOWN,link,https://itsgoingdown.org/nyc-anarchist-action-communique-fire-cannot-contained/,2016-09-14 20:26:45,15,0,8,14,1,0,0,0,0

Even the rich agree: there is no one world and there never has been. For at least forty years – since the last great assault on capital was defeated – crisis management has been the preferred technique of governmental control. Islamic terrorism, spree shootings, illegal immigration, and black revolt have all been used to justify a regime of increasing police militarization, preemptive containment in ghettos and jail cells, and the redevelopment of city space in the name of safety, resilience, and economic hyper productivity. Retired drones from the war in Iraq hover over Baltimore while Terra Bella – one of Google's latest fancy purchases – plans to deploy satellite cameras across the entire planet. The existential ruin necessary to organize this much suffering has left no one unscathed.

Policing also functioned to produce a society grounded in the ""social death"" of Black people.[5] Modern policing continued to evolve after chattel slavery to maintain the racialized division of labor and social divisions that slavery created, but which now (in a post-Emancipation society) had to be reproduced by other forms.

In Madisonville, Kentucky, just an hour south of Evansville, the openly racist and homophobic Traditionalist Worker Party has an active branch. In a recent article, their leader Matthew Heimbach reports going door to door in a trailer park in Madisonville, promoting their fascist[1] ideas among its white working-class residents. The group also recently held a tabling event at Murray State University, in Murray, Kentucky. These efforts must be aggressively countered by white-folks in the Tri-state who do not share their visions of a totalitarian government and the persecution of ethnic and racial minorities.

Punneo was arrested on August 24th for domestic violence against his partner, Manda Elizabeth Boone, who is also a member of the white nationalist movement and a Golden State Skinheads affiliate. Punneo remains in custody as of August 30th for violating the terms of his parole. Punneo has a documented history of sexual assault and violence against women in addition to other violent behavior.

A few weeks prior to his arrest, Punneo and Boone appeared on local Sacramento area television interviews as a part of the ""Blue Crew"" campaign that has been tying blue ribbons around trees in support of law enforcement. After Punneo was recognized by viewers as a suspect in multiple stabbings from the failed Nazi rally at the state capital on June 26th and a public outcry followed, the Blue Crew publicly denounced and distanced themselves from him and Boone. While Punneo has been removed from the streets, his arrest shouldn't be viewed as a victory in the struggle against white supremacy and patriarchy as the institutions of the police and prison system remain central to the protection and perpetuation of these forms of oppression.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/IGDnews/photos/a.1149430018456253.1073741828.1146656498733605/1176149555784299/?type=3,2016-08-30 14:10:16,6,0,8,6,0,0,0,0,0

In order for this strike to not be snuffed out by a handful of prison censors and violent guards, it needs to spread uncontrollably beyond their reach. And because prisons strictly forbid communication between prisoners, it is our responsibility on the outside to facilitate this contagion.

The first obvious step is to begin sending in word of the strike, immediately. If people on the inside are to be able to meaningfully act, they are going to need some time to begin spreading the word to their friends and formulating a plan. To that end, we are suggesting that outside accomplices begin printing the strike announcements (below) and mailing them inside en masse.""","A Challenge: Spread the Strike to Every Jail, Juvie, and Prison! - IT'S GOING DOWN",link,https://itsgoingdown.org/challenge-spread-strike-every-jail-juvie-prison/,2016-08-11 21:48:10,5,0,11,5,0,0,0,0,0

Overall, we want to attack the idea that specifically convention protests have regularly been grounds for ""success."" In reality, convention protests have presented a paradox, as even at times of high anarchist activity and organizing, this often does not translate into 'winning' on the streets, either in terms of people brought into the movement, the generalizing of revolt, shutting things down, or even the shattering of the conventions' spectacle or control of the streets by the police. Overall, we should keep in mind that historically convention protests for anarchists have been failures more often than they have been successes, and when they have been successes, it is by and large because of what we build within our movement to carry out various actions at these events. This means the creation of crews, networks, media centers, medic and legal teams, friendships and bonds of affinity, new communication forms, infrastructure, and forms of organization. These are weapons that we then (hopefully) carry back with us to our regional areas where we live. Meaning, the things we take out of these mobilizations are the big wins; not just what happens in the street, per say.""",Breaking with Convention: Remember Where Our Power Lies - IT'S GOING DOWN,link,https://itsgoingdown.org/breaking-convention-remember-power-lies/,2016-08-04 18:07:12,8,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0
