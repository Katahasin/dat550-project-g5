After Obama's feckless actions in the 2014 Soviet invasion of Ukraine, it sent a signal that we would not enforce our 1994 treaty with Ukraine (Budapest Security Assurances) to stop Soviet aggression. This 'told Vladimir' that America would 'turn the other cheek' on aggressions (because the 1980's called and they wanted their foreign policy back). 

After meeting with Secretary Kerry, Russia then 'annexed' (i.e. invaded) Crimea on the Black Sea. This deployment of the the Us Army's 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division to Poland is not a small step. It is a major signal in what is a growing threat to independent states in the region where commerce (including oil) flows between Europe and Asia.
