214752375232773_964917780216225,"мојата тажна приказна
Цела ноќ, молчиме, 
спијат ѕвезди, а во душа бранови.
Оваа ноќ тажна е,
срце плаче една љубов умира.

Штом ноќта помине и денот осамне,
од песок срца две ќе направам.
Во мојте куфери ќе скријам немири 
и без да плачам ќе си заминам.

Бакни ме, смири се, 
не сме ние први ниту последни.
Сведок е зората,
таа памти безброј средби, разделби.

Штом ноќта помине и денот осамне,
од песок срца две ќе направам.
Во мојте куфери ќе скријам немири 
и без да плачам ќе си заминам.

Секој крај тежок е, 
само надеж утре ќе ни остане.
Гушни ме ангеле,
ова лето вечно да го памтиме.

Штом ноќта помине и денот осамне,
од песок срца две ќе направам.
Во мојте куфери ќе скријам немири 
и без да плачам ќе си заминам",Гоце Арнаудов - Штом ноќта помине + текст,video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBpQx2x-AuQ,2015-08-07 07:43:15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?

Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
So I took what's mine by eternal right.
Took your soul out into the night.
It may be over but it won't stop there,
I am here for you if you'd only care.
You touched my heart you touched my soul.
You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind and that I knew when,
My heart was blinded by you.
I've kissed your lips and held your hand.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.

Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
So I took what's mine by eternal right.
Took your soul out into the night.
It may be over but it won't stop there,
I am here for you if you'd only care.
You touched my heart you touched my soul.
You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind and that I knew when,
My heart was blinded by you.
I've kissed your lips and held your hand.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
I know you well, I know your smell.

I knew it from the start
You would break my heart
But you still I had to play this painful part
You rapped me 'round your itty bitty finger
With your magic smile
You kept me hangin' on a lovers cross a while
You put your spell on me
Took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do to make you stay
I'm gonna miss you
All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh girl
I'm gonna miss you baby",Milli Vanilli - Girl I'm Gonna Miss You,video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbUENJ5FjBk,2015-03-05 12:50:20,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
