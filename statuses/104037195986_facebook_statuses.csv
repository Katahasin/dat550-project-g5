104037195986_10155008579510987,"Democrats Fight Trump, the Man, But Not His Austerity and Militarism
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by BAR executive editor Glen Ford
""The Democrats cynically see the impending disaster as an opportunity to position themselves for the 2018 and 2020 elections.""
At the end of last month, Donald Trump unveiled his military budget, obscenely inflated by $54 billion dollars -- a 10 percent increase that will be paid for with cuts to social programs. There was no organized denunciation from the Democrats, and a few days later, when former Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear gave the Democratic Party response to Trump's speech before the Congress, he had not a word of criticism for Trump's military budget, but instead charged that the president was ""ignoring serious threats to our national security from Russia.""
Russia, Russia, Russia. It is the great diversion, by which the Democrats pretend to lead a resistance to Trumpism, but present no serious opposition to Trump and his fellow Republicans' gutting of poor and working people's programs in the service of militarism. 
The Democrats are putting up no real fight against Trump's domestic austerity agenda. Like Barack Obama, they would welcome a Grand Bargain with the Republicans that freezes or shrinks the social side of the budget while continuing to fund multiple wars all over the planet. Indeed, their principal problem with Trump was that he wasn't bellicose enough; they feared that he might not be eager to play nuclear chicken with the Russians. They are implacable in their battle with Trump, the man, but put up only the most pro forma resistance to Trump's people-crushing budget proposals. 
Do not expect the Democrats to wage an honest fight for the people's health care interests, either. The Republican plan to replace Obamacare is, as expected, an unmitigated disaster. While Obamacare was festering in its own contradictions, the Republican replacement will likely result in 10 million more uninsured Americans and total chaos at every level of health care infrastructure, resulting in an almost instantaneous social and medical crisis -- and not just for poor people. 
Cynical Jockeying for Position
The Democrats cynically see the impending disaster as an opportunity to position themselves for the 2018 and 2020 elections. Although Obamacare is dead, and cannot be resurrected, they will make a show of defending its various parts, one doomed element at a time, even as the private insurance markets that are available to lower income people disintegrate. The Democrats will be glad to let the crisis fester under Republican corruption and incompetence, and then, as the next election season opens, propose some reworked version of Obamacare, probably with weak provisions for a ""public option."" What they will not do, as a party, is respond to the crisis with a push for single payer Medicare for All -- a solution the party's corporate masters will not tolerate. Bernie Sanders, himself, has said he has no plans to submit his own Medicare for All bill to the Senate, this year -- part of his accommodation with the Obama-Clinton party bosses. But, that's fine; the demand should come from masses of people in the streets, representing the super-majorities that have favored single payer for decades. This is a movement moment, and progressive activists must seize the time. The Democrats, however, anticipated that the Left might take the initiative at this critical point in history. Which is why they created the Great Russian Diversion, to distract silly minds.

An Electoral School for Black Self-Determination
The Black political class has ""become servants of the Democratic Party and other institutions outside of our communities,"" and must be replaced, said Omali Yeshitela, chairman of the Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations. The coalition will hold a two-day electoral school, April 8 and 9, in St. Petersburg, Florida, to begin a campaign ""to unleash a new force of people, and inject them into the electoral process based on a struggle for self-determination."" The coalition last year released a 19-point National Black Political Agenda for Self-Determination with positions on the widest range of domestic and foreign policy issues. Candidates that support the Agenda should get Black support -- even if they're Democrats, said Yeshitela.
Blacks Need an Anti-War Movement, Not Anti-Russia Hysteria
The Democrats seem to have an objective interest in having us focus on Donald Trump, the person, as opposed to this system, itself,"" said Ajamu Baraka, the former Green Party vice presidential candidate, a founder of the U.S. Human Rights Network, and an editor and columnist for Black Agenda Report. In this environment, anti-war views are regarded as suspect. ""I'm involved in building a Black Alliance for Peace, to try to revive the Black anti-war movement -- the Black anti-war consciousness,"" he said. ""We think we have a perfect opportunity, now that people are waking up out of this eight-year stupor, to bring the Black community back to where we used to be, as the most consistent anti-war population in this country. But, it's difficult to do this when our people are getting caught up in this anti-Russian hysteria, too,"" said Baraka.
Beyond Black Lives Matter
Despite its success in ""changing the conversation about police brutality in the United States,"" the Black Lives Matter movement ""shows the limitations of social movements that do not advance beyond highlighting injustice,"" said Dr. Keeanga Yamahtta Taylor, the author, activist and professor of African America Studies at Princeton University. In a speech at Detroit's Wayne State University, Taylor said: ""Knowledge, alone, of abuse, injustice and oppression"" is not enough. ""Indeed, mass movements of millions have to be mobilized to stare down the autocratic impulses of the regime in the White House.""
In Praise of Two Exemplary ""Jailhouse Lawyers""
Mumia Abu Jamal spent many years on death row before his sentence was reduced to life in prison. The nation's best known political prisoner has high praise for two other Pennsylvania prison inmates, Craig Williams and Shaun T. Walker, who were kept on death row for years, even after their death sentences were lifted. Williams, said Abu Jamal, is ""one helluva jailhouse lawyer -- still making new law.""
Mumia and other inmates ""have complained about hazardous brown water for several months, and prison officials have done nothing to fix the problem,"" according to a public service announcement produced by the Move organization. ""Enough is enough."" Activists are urging the public to call John Wetzel, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, at 717.728.4109, and ""demand that inmates are given clean water for showers and personal use.""

The ""foreign policies"" of both parties are the maintenance and extension of global US hegemony through military, economic, cultural and diplomatic means.  Trump and his team may pretend to or actually hate some of the players, but they are down for the game, which builds on the foundations of previous administrations.",Trump's Foreign Policy: Continuity or Break? | Black Agenda Report,link,http://bit.ly/2kzYC5v,2017-02-16 08:06:38,36,1,21,31,0,0,0,0,5

Hundreds gathered in Columbia, South Carolina, to protest President Trump's ban on refugees and visitors from seven mostly Muslim countries.

One Out of 9 U.S. Inmates Serving Life
Despite ""modest"" reductions of about 5 percent in the overall U.S. prison population since 2009, the number and proportion of inmates serving life sentences continues to increase. A new study by The Sentencing Project, titled ""Delaying a Second Chance: The Declining Prospects for Parole on Life Sentences,"" puts much of the blame on politicians and parole boards. ""Legislatures have increased minimum sentence requirements that people have to serve before a parole board can even review someone for parole eligibility,"" said study author Dr. Nazgol Ghandnoosh. Back in the 1980s, a person sentenced to life for murder could expect to get out in about 11 and a half years, but someone similarly sentenced in the 21st century would be likely to spend more than 23 years -- twice as long -- behind bars. ""Parole boards are granting fewer paroles or refusing to increase them, even though they're seeing people so much later in their sentence,"" said Ghandnoosh. Longer actual terms for lifers results in longer sentences for everyone else, she said. More than 160,000 U.S. prison inmates are serving life sentences, 50,000 of them with no possibility of parole.
""Collective Punishment"" of Prisoners
Kerry ""Shakaboona"" Marshall is one of the thousands of lifers sentenced for crimes committed when they were juveniles. Marshall has already spent a quarter century behind bars. He edits a prison magazine and is a correspondent for Prison Radio, but could not reach his editors on the outside because of a lockdown following a fight among a few inmates at Rockview prison, in Pennsylvania. Such ""collective punishment,"" he told Prison Radio's Noelle Hanrahan, cuts prisoners off from their support structures.

The Campaign for Community Control Over the Police, a coalition of 26 anti-police terror organizations, will hold the first of several ""Open House Conferences"" on February 18, at Manhattan's All Souls Unitarian Church.

Precinct commanders would be elected by the neighborhood, just as ""you have sheriffs who are elected by the community"" in smaller towns. An elected Community Police Control Board would have subpoena powers and the right to hire and fire police, and an elected special prosecutor, ""totally independent of the district attorney's office,"" would ""investigate and prosecute allegations of serious criminal conduct by police officers,"" said Olugbala.

104037195986_10154906052350987,"Democrats, Including Bernie Sanders, Won't Fight for Medicare for All
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Because Obama had used the trick terminology 'universal health care' to describe his program, the public became confused and demoralized about the whole subject of government health care.""
Democrats will tell you that the Republicans are the reason the U.S. is the only industrial country in the world that does not have universal, government-provided health care. But, that's not true. Despite their legislative majorities, the Republicans are not strong enough on their own to defeat a concerted campaign for a Medicare for All program, which is supported by overwhelming majorities of the public, including a very large percentage of Republicans. The U.S. does not have a single payer health care system because corporate Democratic leadership, most shamefully under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, have confused the public about what is, and what is not, ""universal"" health care. They have offered counterfeit, private industry-based schemes – ""Hillary-care"" in 1993, Obamacare in 2009 -- and fraudulently called them universal health care, when in fact these were bait-and-switch schemes designed to prevent the successful passage of a genuine single payer health program.
The numbers tell the tale. When Bill Clinton first ran for president in 1992, two-thirds of the public – 66 percent – told pollsters they supported a ""national health insurance plan financed by tax money."" The Clintons instead responded with a secretly-hatched ""managed competition"" plan that continued to rely on private insurers and took more than 1,300 pages to explain. ""Hillary-care"" died ignominiously in Congress. 
""Corporate Democratic leadership have confused the public about what is, and what is not, 'universal' health care.""
By late 2006, an amazing 69 percent of Americans were telling pollsters they agreed with the statement that ""it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure that all Americans have healthcare coverage."" Barack Obama was getting ready to make his run for the White House. He claimed to want something he called ""universal health care."" Most people assumed he meant a single payer, Medicare for All-type program, but instead, Obama dusted off an old Republican private insurance-based plan devised by the far-right Heritage Foundation and later adopted by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. 
Not only was Obamacare unpopular on its own merits, but because Obama had used the trick terminology ""universal health care"" to describe his program, the public became confused and demoralized about the whole subject of government health care. By 2016, only 44 percent of the people had a positive reaction to the term ""single payer health coverage."" However, nearly two-thirds of those polled -- 64 percent -- liked the idea of Medicare-for-All, which is a form of single payer. Medicare for the elderly is probably the nation's most popular social safety net program, and younger folks would like to be part of it, too, including lots of low-income Republicans. Even Donald Trump used to be for it.
Medicare-for-All is an idea whose time has come -- again! And, with Obamacare being dismantled and a health care emergency looming, one would think the Democrats would seize the time to push for a truly universal health care plan with such broad support. But, corporate Democratic leadership -- just like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama -- do not really want single payer health care, because their fat cat contributors oppose it. Therefore, they will urge the people to waste their energy on trying to salvage some aspects of Obamacare.
Bernie Sanders will help them do it, because he's still sheep-dogging for corporate Democrats.

Obamacare is Doomed; It's Time for Single Payer
Instead of attempting to salvage the doomed and fatally flawed Affordable Healthcare Act, progressives should seize the time and push for single payer health care, said pediatrician and political activist Dr. Margaret Flowers. ""Eighty percent of Democratic voters want a single payer health care system, and now polls are showing that even Republicans, particularly those with lower incomes, are moving into majority support for National Improved Medicare for All."" The push, however, must come from the people, not the Democrats. ""Even Sen. Sanders has backed down and is saying, Let's protect the Affordable Care Act now and we'll fight for single payer later,"" said Flowers. The HOPE campaign -- ""Health Over Profit for Everyone"" -- begins February 1.
On Reparations, It's Not a Question of ""If,"" but ""How""
There's been a substantive change in H.R. 40, the Reparations legislation Rep. John Conyers has introduced every year since 1989. Originally, the bill called for a study of whether Black Americans had been injured by slavery and Jim Crow. But now, according to Kamm Howard, chairman of the legislative committee of N'COBRA, the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, the bill ""begins with the focus that reparations are due, and how does this government engage in reparative initiatives."" He said the 2001 United Nations World Conference on Racism, in Durban, South Africa, made clear the enslaving nations' ""obligation to make repairs"" to descendants of the victims. Howard helped Rep. Conyers' staff reframe the legislation.
Will Democrats Help Trump Renegotiate NAFTA?
""If President Trump wants to enact a renegotiated NAFTA, he's going to have to work with the Democrats to figure out how to build a majority"" on Capitol Hill, ""which will be comprised of most of the Democrats and a handful of Republicans,"" said Lori Wallach, director of Global Trade Watch for Public Citizen. President Bill Clinton pushed the NAFTA corporate trade deal through Congress against the wishes of majorities of Democrats. ""The reality is, you will never get a majority of the Republicans in Congress to change the old NAFTA,"" said Wallach. NAFTA might not end in a renegotiation. ""If President Trump continues to be so disrespectful to other world leaders,"" Mexico or the U.S. might simply withdraw from NAFTA.
Courtrooms as Political Forums
Veteran Black activist Efia Nwangaza had been looking forward to a jury trial on charges of blocking a Greenville, South Carolina, intersection two years ago to protest a Missouri grand jury's failure to indict the cop that killed Michael Brown, in Ferguson. However, Greenville authorities dropped the charges the day before her trial, depriving Nwangaza of the opportunity to put on a political defense. ""The purpose of the demonstration was to call attention to police impunity and their slaughtering of us from one end of the country to the other,"" said Nwangaza, director of the Malcolm X Center for Self-Determination and a leader of the state's Stop Mass Incarceration Network. With the courtroom venue no longer available, Nwangaza and her defense team will now bring the issues before a people's tribunal and ""strengthen the cause that has been advanced by the Uhuru Movement for Black community control of the police.""

104037195986_10154886671585987,"Flint's 1000-Plus Days Without Safe Drinking Water
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Residents have been fooled 'too many times' and will never trust the water again.""
Flint, Michigan, a city that used to be famous for producing cars but gained notoriety almost three years ago for its poisoned water supply, last week marked its 1000th day without clean drinking water. Nevertheless, the 100,000 mostly poor, predominantly Black residents of Flint have been informed that the current levels of lead in their water no longer exceed federal limits. That would be good news – if you could believe it, and if lead were the only problem with Flint's water. Mona Hanna-Attisha doesn't believe the water is safe for drinking. She's the pediatrician who helped blow the whistle on skyrocketing rates of lead in the blood of Flint's children, after state emergency financial managers forced the city to draw its water from the heavily polluted Flint River. Dr. Hanna-Attisha says the federal regulations are too weak to protect young brains and bodies from stunted development. 
Gina Luster, a community organizer in Flint, warns that, even if lead levels are down, the there's plenty of other harmful stuff in the water. Her advice is, ""Don't drink the Kool-Aid."" Luster says she and other residents have been fooled ""too many times"" and will never trust the water again.""
Nine people have so far been criminally charged in the poisoning of Flint's water, eight of them state employees. But no one at the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which has broad powers over the whole country's water supply, has been charged with a crime. The EPA, however, is on President Donald Trump's hit list -- not for failing the people of Flint, but for sometimes getting on the wrong side of Trump's friends in polluting industries. The Trump administration has frozen all EPA grants and contracts, which put in question $100 million that Congress allocated to help Flint replace and repair its water infrastructure. Michigan's two Senators, both of them Democrats, got worried when they heard about the freeze from news reports. Neither the White House nor the EPA could say for sure whether Flint's money had been tied up by the freeze. Plus, the money doesn't exactly have Flint's name on it. The $100 million is supposed to be awarded to ""a municipality that is, or has been, the subject of an emergency declaration due to lead contamination. The bill doesn't mention Flint by name. However, the funds should eventually find their way to Flint, since it's the only city in the country that fits that description.
Multiply that by 3,000
But, when it comes to lead poisoning, Flint is anything but alone. An investigative report by the Reuters news agency, in December, showed that children in nearly 3,000 communities across the country show lead levels in their blood at least twice as high as kids in Flint. In more than 1,100 neighborhoods, kids tested four times higher than children in Flint. At the peak of the contamination of Flint's water, 5 percent of children tested had high levels of lead. However, in some neighborhoods in South Bend, Indiana almost one-third of the kids had high lead levels. Pennsylvania is the state with the most census tracts with lead-contaminated water. Thirty-six percent of the kids in Warren, Pennsylvania tested high for lead. 
So, if Flint needs $100 million to tackle a lead problem that is, supposedly, close to under control, how much money is needed to make the water safe in 3,000 other communities across the country?

This new McCarthyism is ""a strange diversion"" and ""a demonstration of the irrationality of politics in the U.S,"" said Baraka, who is also an editor and columnist for Black Agenda Report.

The scourge of poverty has increased since the Poor People's Campaign of 1968 was interrupted by the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said Willie Baptist, a veteran of the welfare and homeless movements, and now an organizer of the 21st century version of the campaign. ""Poverty has gotten worse, with huge sections of the middle strata being rendered homeless and a good section of the poor rendered superfluous,"" said Baptist, now based in New York City at the Union Theological Seminary's Kairos Center. Changes in technology are ""not just saving labor, it's actually eliminating labor,"" he said. ""The world's productive capacity totally outweighs its purchasing capacity. As a result, you have poverty in the midst of plenty.""
Afro-Colombian Leader Beheaded
Rightwing paramilitaries are suspected in the murder of Emilsen Manyoma, a leader of a network of Black and indigenous community organizations. ""Her assassination was a response to the work she was doing, defending the rights of Black people,"" said Charo Mina-Rojas, an Afro-Colombian political activist who reports that over 200 Black and indigenous leaders were killed last year, despite a peace agreement between the government and FARC guerillas. Blacks and natives in Ms. Manyoma's region are under pressure from coca producers and illegal mine operators and their gunmen.
Where Did All the Black and Latino Teachers Go?

""When you look at what's been going on for the past 15 years, you see a picture that requires people to point to the real causes of the disappearances, and to change those policies,"" said Sean Ahern, a political activist who teaches juvenile prisoners at the giant Rikers Island jail. Ahern blames the drop in minority teachers on ""mayoral control"" of the schools, ""high stakes testing, school closings, charter school push-ins"" -- essentially, the whole program of so-called ""reform"" that was pushed by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and championed by the Obama administration.

The ever-deepening concentration of wealth that is both the logic and the inevitable result of capitalism has reached such depraved proportions that eight of the richest people on the planet now own as much wealth as the bottom half of the entire human race. The very existence of such concentrated private wealth is a crime against humanity, and incompatible with any notion of civilization. Indeed, how can a society call itself civilized, when half the value of all of humanity's labor -- which is what those fortunes actually represent -- is at the disposal of eight men?
Clearly, the world needs a revolution, to throw off the dead weight of these billionaires. Last year, the Oxfam organization calculated that it took 62 of the world's richest people to equal the wealth held by the bottom half of humanity. This year, it only takes eight. According to Oxfam's latest study, the way capitalism is going, in 25 years we could be talking about a few trillionaires controlling the wealth of planet Earth. However, I doubt that we will ever see an Age of Trillionaires if only because global society would shatter and explode from the sheer magnitude of the accumulated theft of human labor and natural resources.
The billionaires must be made extinct, one way or the other, so that the multitudes can restructure the world into a survivable place. The 500 richest people on the planet cannot be allowed, 20 years from now, to pass on $2.1 trillion in inheritance to their privileged children -- the equivalent of the entire yearly economy of India and its 1.3 billion people. 
The Last of the Super-Rich
The United States has by far the highest concentration of billionaires – 536, followed by China, with 251. Russia is way down in sixth place, with only 77 billionaires, behind Britain, Germany and India. But, of course, billionaires live anywhere they want to -- which really means they live nowhere at all. Home is where their money is, and every billionaire is a fully globalized citizen, with no loyalties except to his class.
The existence of billionaires should be seen as a measure of the sickness of the capitalist system, now in its last stages. Of the eight richest billionaires in the United States, six made their fortunes from the telecommunications industry, whose political influence now rivals that of Wall Street. Not only are the Silicon Valley fat cats obscenely wealthy, but they control the information systems that he rest of us depend on to understand what's going on in our world. That makes people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg very dangerous. The good news is, young people around the world understand the nature of the threat to human freedom posed by these information system tycoons, who got rich through monopoly and market manipulation, just like the other capitalists. They too, must face expropriation, so that the saga of human equality can begin.

The Democrats: Serving the One Percent, Blaming the Russians
The Democrats are using the Russians as a scapegoat to avoid confronting ""the rightwing Wall Street-captive party that they've become,"" said activist and educator Paul Street, author of several books on President Barack Obama. Essentially, Democrats are saying, ""It's not that we're a rightwing, corporate, neoliberal party beholden to the nation's unelected dictatorship of money and empire. It's not that we abandoned the working class and the causes of social justice and peace decades ago."" Speaking at the Open University of the Left, in Chicago, Street said Donald Trump did not ride to victory on a ""big rust belt rebellion of the white working class."" The real story ""is that the Democrats lost those voters to non-voting."" 
When Capitalism Gets Sick, the Democrats Get Mean
The Democratic Party's sharp turn to the right is its response to the ""existential crisis at the core of capitalism,"" a global phenomenon that has left the ruling class and its servants with ""hardly any space to reform the system,"" said Dr. Anthony Monteiro, the Philadelphia-based Duboisian scholar and activist. With ""no room to maneuver,"" the capitalists resort increasingly to war and repression. ""Monopoly capitalism must be undone, the banks broken up, a large part of them nationalized,"" said Monteiro. ""In other words,"" there must be ""a profound and fundamental end to the neoliberal order, globally; a retreat from empire and war; and a seizing of the military budget and turning it towards economic development, jobs and a green economy.""
Political Prisoners Under Pressure in Indiana
Khalfani Malik Khaldun, serving time at Wabash Valley prison, in Indiana, said officials have carried out ""a series of raids on targeted political prisoners,"" including himself. Khaldun was told by ""top brass"" that they consider him to be the facility's ""most influential"" inmate and are pressuring him to use that influence to ""stop the proliferation of meth, a synthetic drug spreading throughout the prison."" Otherwise, ""they had orders to put me and ten of my comrades in solitary confinement,"" where he is now housed. Khaldun said prison officials ""are making me out to be running some form of drug ring, in an attempt to destroy my political credibility as an activist on the inside.""

Obama's Last Presidential Lies
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Obama spent his first term sabotaging every effort to create mandatory limits on emissions.""
Barack Obama has spoken to the nation as president for the last time. Hallelujah! The man I dubbed the ""more effective evil"" now gets a chance to make millions for himself, after spending eight years defending the wealth of the bankers and the rest of the One Percent. 
Obama is going out like he came in: telling lies, with great style and skill. So many lies. He said he favored giving unions ""the power to organize for better wages."" He said the same thing when he was campaigning for his first term, promising to support the ""card check"" bill that would have allowed workers to rebuild their union membership. But he betrayed organized labor and did nothing to push the bill in Congress.
The outgoing president pointed out that ""the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn't just vanish in the Sixties"" – that these effects continue to plague Black people. But 100 days after first taking the oath of office, Obama told reporters that he would not consider programs targeted at Black communities -- that Blacks would have to depend on a rising tide to lift all boats, even though no such tide has ever risen for Black people in America. 
Obama said the U.S. has ""led the world...on the promise to save the planet."" That's an outrageous lie. The U.S., China and a few other powerful countries have been the problem, not the solution to climate change. Obama spent his first term sabotaging every effort to create mandatory limits on emissions.
""On his watch, no federal charges were brought against any killer cops.""
The First Black President acknowledged that many Americans are ""convinced that their government only serves the interests of the powerful."" But, he didn't take any of the blame, even though it was under his administration that Wall Street bankers were deemed ""too big to jail,"" or even to indict. In the same dishonest fashion, Obama declared on Tuesday that ""We need to uphold laws against discrimination...and in our criminal justice system"" -- when, on his watch, no federal charges were brought against any killer cops, except one who had already been indicted by local authorities. 
Obama got downright cocky in defense of Obamacare, the rightwing Republican health program that Obama adopted as his own. The president said: ""If anybody can put together a plan that is demonstrably better, I will support it."" But don't bet any money on the letter and spirit of Obama's promises on health care. Back in 2003, when Bruce Dixon and I asked him if he favored a single payer health care system, Obama answered that he favored ""universal health care for all Americans"" and intended to introduce or sponsor legislation toward that end."" He kept saying that for the next five years, until he was elected president, and then proceeded to isolate and crush supporters of single payer, to the delight of the insurance and drug industries, which no longer had to fear single payer. Obama is sneaky, that way.
Finally, Obama bragged that the U.S. has ""taken out thousands of terrorists, including bin Laden."" What he didn't say was that his administration presided over the jihadist takeovers of Libya and much of Syria and Iraq. The truth is that tens of thousands of jihadists have been trained, armed, financed and protected by the United States and its allies – not under Bush, but under Obama, making him fully responsible for the deaths of half a million people in those three countries, alone. Not to mention Obama's other wars. But, I've run out of time. The good thing is, so has Obama.

Rally in DC for Black Self-Determination
Self-determination is the ""missing ingredient"" in contemporary Black politics, said Omali Yeshitela, chairman of the Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations. The Coalition will hold a rally on January 14 at Freedom Plaza, on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, to advance ""an independent Black agenda for our people, and not have us joined at the hip to the Democratic Party."" The time is ripe for a Black self-determinationist strategy, said Yeshitela, because ""the Democrats, the Republicans, and the electoral process, itself, have fallen into disrepute."" 
Reforming the Green Party
""We have to take our movement away from the non-profits, and the only way we can do that is if we can transform the Green Party into something more like the working class, socialist parties overseas,"" said Georgia Green Party co-chair Bruce Dixon, speaking on a telephone call-in with party members across the country. ""All of these parties are based on membership dues,"" with their officers accountable to the membership -- something our current Green Party does not do,"" said Dixon, who is also managing editor of Black Agenda Report. Some members warned that a dues structure might discourage involvement of low-income people, while others cautioned against ""infiltration"" of the Party by other groups. The Green Party garnered only about one percent of the vote in November.
Judge Orders Hep-C Cure for Mumia
A federal judge ruled that, within three weeks, Pennsylvania prison officials must begin administering a Hepatitis-C cure to the nation's best known political prisoner. Atty. Bob Boyle, of Mumia Abu Jamal's legal team, told BAR producer Kyle Fraser: ""This judge ruled that the 8th Amendment guarantees people in prison adequate health care under the 'cruel and inhuman treatment' clause."" Boyle said ""upwards of 40 percent of the prisoners in the Pennsylvania system have chronic Hepatitis-C,"" and could benefit from the ruling. 
Mumia Abu Jamal suffered a near-death crisis in mid-2015 due to complications from the disease. When told of the judge's ruling, he urged activists to ""spread the word, because this is not what the Commonwealth wants people to know about -- that they engage in unconstitutional medical practices designed, not to cure, and not even to treat,"" a deadly illness. ""Here we have a cure, and the government of Pennsylvania refused to give it to thousands of people for years, until they got to the brink of death.""

104037195986_10154816524675987,"A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
Americans imprison big, but they pardon very small. President Obama set a record by giving clemency to 1/2000th of the 2.3million U.S. prison inmates. The Brennan Center recommends release of 40 percent of inmates. But the Black Is Back Coalition calculates that even release of twice that many – 80 percent – would still maintain mass incarceration at 1973 levels. The whole damn system has to go, for Black folks to even get close to justice.
Obama's Pardons Distract from the Horror of Mass Black Incarceration
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The system is deliberately racist, brutal, arbitrary and malevolent.""
President Obama, a master of public relations, now has bragging rights for having granted clemency to a record number of federal prisoners – 1,176 of them, at last count, more than those set free by the past 11 presidents, combined. Looking at the number from a different angle, Obama released only one out of every two thousand of the nation's 2.3 million prison inmates, the largest incarcerated population in the world, both in raw numbers and in the proportion of U.S. society living behind bars. In other words, Obama's clemencies, like all other presidents', are statistically meaningless and morally and politically distractive. But, of course, that's what Obama's good at – distracting people. 
The incompetent, lazy and white supremacist corporate media forget, or never reported, that for several years the Obama administration delayed the release from prison of five times as many inmates as he pardoned: about 6,000 federal prisoners convicted under the old crack cocaine laws. A federal appeals court wanted to let them out, ruling that they were covered by a prison reform bill, but President Obama successfully argued to keep these men and women in prison. Several years later, Obama staged a huge public relations extravaganza, releasing many of these same inmates, supposedly out of the goodness of his heart.  It was two years too late. Some never got out.
The Brennan Center for Justice released a study last month that concluded the U.S. could set free 39 percent of its prison population with no threat to public safety. The Brennan researchers argue that you can't make a dent in the mass incarceration system unless whole categories of prisoners are made eligible for immediate release. They say 25 percent of the prison population should, instead, have been sentenced to drug treatment, community service, probation or a fine. Another 14 percent of inmates have already served enough time in prison, and are no longer a risk. Together, that comes to almost 40 percent of the prison population -- one and a half million people, about half of them Black.
""Not Even a Half-Way Measure""
Prison reformers seem to think the system can be made more rational and fair. They don't seem to understand that the system is deliberately racist, brutal, arbitrary and malevolent -- it is not meant to be fair, and it cannot be reformed. Former Black Panther Sundiata Acoli turns 80 this month. He has been in a New Jersey prison since 1973 and first became eligible for parole in 1992, but was turned down by the parole board, which set his next parole hearing for 15 years from now, when Sundiata Acoli will be 95 years old.  
This system is pure meanness and race-hate. The Brennan Center's proposal to release almost 40 percent of prison inmates is, itself, not even a half-way measure. As the Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations points out in number five of its 19 point platform on Black self-determination, the United States would have to release 80 percent of its prison population -- four out of every five inmates -- just to bring the incarceration rate down to 1973 levels. And, remember: the U.S. was already the worst mass incarceration state in the world back in 1973. Even the release of four out every five inmates does not change the essential nature of American mass Black incarceration. There can be no compromise with such an evil.

Obama, Trump, Clinton, Bush – They All Serve the Same Masters
When Donald Trump recently stated a willingness to escalate the arms race, it caused a great media stir. But President Obama set in motion a trillion dollar nuclear weapons upgrade with barely a peep from the corporate press. ""It really shows that it's the U.S. system, it's the Pentagon as a military institution, and corporations that must expand or they suffocate,"" that are the source of endless war policies, said Sara Flounders, of the United National Anti-War Coalition. ""Although the media always acts like there is a choice, that there are huge differences"" between the candidates of the two major parties, ""both carry out the interests of U.S. corporate power."" 
Haitians Take to Streets to Defy U.S. – and Americans Should Do the Same
Jovenel Moise, the rightwing candidate that elections officials claim won 55 percent of the vote in a four-way presidential race, ""is the individual that the United States understands will continue the plunder, the pillaging that they've been doing in Haiti,"" said Daoud Andre, a Brooklyn-based Haitian community activist and radio host. Charging the November 20 vote was rigged, tens of thousands of Haitians have engaged in nearly daily protests. U.S. progressives should take note, and ""not take on Donald Trump from a defensive position,"" said Andre. ""I think we have to go back to the militant movements of the Sixties, movements for people to take their destinies in their own hands. We cannot be afraid of a clown. These are paper tigers.""
Obama's ""Legacy"": A Boon for the Rich
""We are in a 'post-hope' era,"" BreakingBrown.com publisher Yvette Carnell told Counterpunch Radio host Eric Draitser. ""He saved the financial industry and neutralized working people's politics, especially Black politics, and left us far worse off than we were before he came."" The outgoing president ""was a creature of Wall Street and finance capital from the beginning,"" said fellow guest Pascal Robert, a lawyer and frequent contributor to Black Agenda Report. ""He had complete control of the Senate and the House"" but ""expended no political capital to push a jobs agenda at any time in his presidency.""
Milwaukee Cops Pressure Panther Feed-the-People Program
Activists and parents say Milwaukee police hit a 10 year-old girl in the face while targeting a community feeding program operated by the Revolutionary Black Panther Party, last week. ""This is the first time since the 1960s that they have attacked a Black Panther food program,"" said Dr. Alli Muhammad, Chief General Commander of the RBPP. The police seem angered that the Panther group held an armed march -- legal, under Wisconsin law -- and organized an African Holocaust Human Rights Tribunal, the week before. ""It appears that they are trying to intimidate the people, to make them afraid to support us,"" said Dr. Muhammad.
Mumia on the ""Magic of Black Music""
The nation's best known political prisoner noted the passing of Sharon Jones, lead singer for Dap-Kings, and British pop star George Michael. ""It was in the magical realm of music that Black folks found their closest vision of freedom -- to be, to become, themselves,"" said Mumia Abu Jamal, in a commentary for Prison Radio. Of George Michael, he said: ""Black musical beats and rhythms liberated him, freed him to be his self, because in Black music one finds that yearning for freedom.""

The Green Party must learn how to ""differentiate ourselves from the Democrats."" Otherwise, said Dr. Margaret Flowers, the party's recent candidate for U.S. Senate from Maryland, ""If Trump runs again, it will be another 'anybody-but Trump' year, and whoever the Democrats throw up there, no matter how bad, will be considered better than Trump"" -- and we'll have the same old problem. ""If we, ourselves embrace 'lesser-evilism,' then it only makes sense for other people to do that, as well."" Dr. Flowers said Green presidential candidate Jill Stein failed to think ""strategically"" before launching her voter recount effort, which was ultimately an expression of lesser-evilism.
Police Reformer Weighs Run for NYC Mayor, Cites Courts Full of ""Crap"" Cases
When Robert Gangi, director of the Police Reform Organizing Project, sends observers into the New York City court system, they see mainly ""crap cases"" based on minor offenses rarely, ""if ever, involving anyone who we could possibly characterize as being dangerous or predatory."" Gangi said the court dockets prove ""the cops are engaged in blatantly racist practices that do little, if anything, to contribute to public safety, and that do harm to people."" He's considering running for mayor as a ""protest candidate"" against Bill de Blasio, who has bought into an intrusive and aggressive ""Broken Windows"" policing policy. 
Technology Makes Universal, Quality Employment Possible – But Not Under Capitalism
""The task right now, is how we rethink work, rethink distribution, and rethink ownership – fundamentally,"" said Dr. J. Phillip Thompson, professor of Urban Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Speaking on a podcast hosted by Dr. Michael Dawson, the nation's premier Black social demographer and director of the University of Chicago's Center for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture, Dr. Thompson said President Obama missed the chance in 2008 to ""use the takeover of General Motors as an opportunity to change ownership or the way manufacturing happens in America."" Thompson said studies show it would cost $6-$700 billion a year ""to gainfully employ every able-bodied person in the U.S."" at a good job paying about $50,000 annually – about one-twentieth of the cost of Obama's bailout of the financial industry.

Go to DC to Fight for Black Self-Determination – Not for Clinton and the CIA
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The Black servants of the Democratic Party have made a pact with that section of the U.S. ruling class that has rallied around Hillary Clinton.""
If the U.S. ruling class and the spies and national security goons that serve them wanted to divert attention from the crimes and crises of capitalism, they have temporarily succeeded. In this insane post-election season, all the corporate media talk about is the outrageous fiction that Russia is the greatest threat to American domestic peace and tranquility. Jim Crow stole the election, as usual, but the corporate media and Hillary Clinton's minions blame it on the Russians. Tens of thousands of people will descend on Washington to denounce Donald Trump's inauguration – which, given his horrific appointments and domestic policies, would be the righteous thing to do. If Clinton had won, she too should have been confronted with vast crowds of demonstrators determined to bring her ""to heel"" for crimes of mass Black incarceration and a whole list of other offenses against humanity. But it is already clear that the useless and self-serving Black Misleadership Class, who work for the Democratic Party rather than for their Black constituents, will be making common cause with the CIA and the war profiteers, shouting their worthless heads off about Vladimir Putin who -- to paraphrase Muhammad Ali -- never called anybody the N-word, that we know of, or kicked millions of poor women and children off welfare, or imposed a reign of terror in Black communities. That was the Clintons, remember? 
""Black people are their own liberators.""
The Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations will also be in Washington around the time of the inauguration -- on January 14, the day before Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday. But, the coalition will not join hands with Hillary's friends on Wall Street and the Pentagon. Instead, Black Is Back will declare to the world its intention to fight for Black self-determination in every aspect of life, ""despite the rise of Donald Trump and his version of white nationalism."" The Black is Back Coalition is telling the incoming administration that Black people are their own liberators. And, that is a very different kind of message than you'll be hearing from the Black servants of the Democratic Party, who have made a pact with that section of the U.S. ruling class that has rallied around Hillary Clinton, a raving, maniacal war criminal who is culpable in the death of millions. 
The Black Misleadership Class can imagine no other way to function except to become junior partners with one powerful group of oppressors or the other. Independent Black politics is alien to them, because they see no money in it -- no profit in the liberation of other Black people. And so, they methodically sacrifice Black folks' interests, and the hopes and dreams of all oppressed peoples, in return for some squatting room at the feet of the enemy.
The Black Misleaders have no shame, and no demands either, except that they get paid. The Black is Back Coalition, on the other hand, has put forward a 19 point agenda to guide the fight for Black self-determination, a human right of all peoples and the basis of solidarity among the oppressed -- points that will be thoroughly discussed on January 14th at Freedom Plaza, at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, in Washington, DC. 
The struggle is not about choosing between Trump and Clinton; it's about Black self-determination and bringing down this evil system.

Gabbard's Law: To End War on Terror, Stop Arming Terrorists
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The United States has spent billions of dollars to arm, train and protect whole armies of jihadist terrorists in Syria.""
Ever since the passage of the Patriot Act in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, it has been a crime to provide ""material support"" to groups designated as terrorists by the U.S. State Department, including ISIS and al-Qaida and its Syrian affiliate, the al-Nusra Front. As the law is interpreted, ""material support"" can mean providing almost any kind of service or assistance that a prosecutor believes might materially help the designated group -- even attending a peace conference or representing a group member in court. Americans have done hard time in prison for being found in violation of this law. But, at the same time, the United States has spent billions of dollars to arm, train and protect whole armies of jihadist terrorists in Syria – Islamist fighters that collaborate in every possible way with al-Qaida and its offspring in the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State.
In the words of Tulsi Gabbard, the Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii: ""This madness must end... The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its citizens."" Gabbard has introduced a bill to force the U.S. government to abide by its own laws, as well as international law, by making it specifically illegal for U.S. to fund aid of any kind, not just to al-Qaida and ISIS, but to any other groups that collaborate with them. In Syria, that means virtually all of the so-called ""moderate"" rebels that the U.S. and its allies have lavished billions of dollars on. Just as importantly, Gabbard's Stop Arming Terrorists Act makes it illegal for the United States to give aid to any nation that assists these terrorists. That means the U.S. would be compelled to cut off aid to Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Israel, the biggest recipient of U.S. aid in the world, which openly brags about treating al-Qaida fighters in Israeli hospitals. The U.S. would also have to cut off all assistance to Britain, France and most of the rest of NATO, for their assistance to terrorists in Syria. 
Rep. Keith Ellison: Useless to the Cause of Peace
Earlier this year, the Obama administration reneged on its agreement with Russia to draw up a list of the jihadist groups Washington supports, and to make sure they don't fight alongside al-Qaida. Gabbard's law would require that the Director of National Intelligence draw up a list of the jihadi groups that are cooperating with al-Qaida and ISIS, and update that list every six month, to make sure none of them get U.S. assistance.
Gabbard models her bill on 1980s Boland Amendment that halted U.S. aid to the U.S. Contra terrorists, in Nicaragua. She was joined by two Republican and two Democratic co-sponsors, including Black California congresswoman Barbara Lee. The bill is endorsed by the Progressive Democrats of America and the U.S. Peace Council. But don't expect it to get effective support from the Progressive Caucus in the U.S. Congress. Minnesota Black congressman Keith Ellison is Caucus co-chair – and absolutely worthless to the cause of peace. He supported the war against Libya and the proxy war in Syria, which is why he stands a good chance of becoming head of the Democratic National Committee, where it's all war, and anti-Russia, all the time.

Baraka: Fear of Trump Defeated the Green Party
Voters ""wanted a change, but were concerned that if they stood with the Green Party challenge, that would in effect be a vote for Donald Trump -- and we know that the propaganda was very effective in advancing that notion,"" said the Greens' vice presidential choice, Ajamu Baraka.

Dixon Defends Stein Vote Recount
Jill Stein and the Green Party are ""not jumping into bed with the Democrats"" with their call for a recount of votes in three mid-western states narrowly lost by Hillary Clinton, said Bruce Dixon, co-chair of the Georgia Green Party.

Dixon, who is also managing editor of BAR, said Bernie Sanders should have filed a recount complaint against Hillary Clinton for ""stealing"" the primary elections in states like Massachusetts and California. ""It seems that Bernie and his people were too intent on staying in the [Democratic] club.""
The Democratic Party Can't Be Fixed
""The powers in the Democratic Party preferred Trump to Bernie Sanders,"" said veteran anti-war activist David Swanson, publisher of the influential web site War Is A Crime. ""They wanted Hillary or nothing, and that's what they got."" Those same people, he said, resist naming Rep. Keith Ellison as head of the Democratic National Committee.

Blacks Systematically Barred from Temporary Jobs in Chicago
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The Black applicants would wind up sitting in the office beginning at dawn, watching Hispanics get assigned to work all day long.""
A national temporary worker staffing agency and a number of its clients have been sued for discriminating against Black workers. It's a class action suit, filed in federal court by the Workers Law Office, a small but dedicated team of people's lawyers in Chicago. The offending agency, MVP Staffing, has 60 offices in 38 states and connects hundreds of businesses with tens of thousands of people seeking temporary employment. But, according to Workers Center lawyer Christopher Williams, 98 percent of the jobs in the Chicago area go to Hispanics, most of them undocumented. That's what most of MVP Staffing's clients want: undocumented Mexicans who are in no position to argue about working conditions or pay. Temporary work agencies and their business clients conspire to extract super-profits at the expense of both the undocumented workers, who are locked in a twilight zone of low pay and fearful silence, and Black applicants who line up for work every day, but are seldom hired. 
The temporary work agencies and their clients play a cynical game, blaming each other for excluding Blacks from the workplace. The agencies say they are simply complying with their clients' wishes. The clients say they're not responsible, because the agencies do the hiring.
Some of MVP Staffings employees have told on their bosses. A former dispatcher said the company used a system of code words to deny Black people jobs. African Americans were sarcastically referred to as ""guapos"" – which means ""the handsome ones"" – while Hispanics were code-named ""feos,"" or ""the ugly ones."" It's a nasty way of saying that Blacks don't want to get their hands dirty or work as hard as the Mexicans. Of course, Blacks showed up at the agency every morning, willing to get down and dirty on just about any job. But most often, the Black applicants would wind up sitting in the office beginning at dawn, watching Hispanics get assigned to work all day long, until nobody was left in the room but broke and bitter Black folks. 
The Unwanted
It was said to be common for managers to ask MVP to only send them workers that listened to 
107.9 FM, a Spanish language radio station in Chicago. 
If Black applicants somehow got placed on jobs, their paperwork would often be marked ""D.N.R.,"" meaning ""do not return"" this person to that job again. 
Of course, if Black people really didn't want to work or get their hands dirty, companies like MVP wouldn't have to deploy such elaborate -- and illegal – codes, lies and dirty tricks to keep them unemployed. And, if the Mexican workers were not in dread of deportation, they would be just as willing to stand up for decent pay and conditions as Black workers are. But, businessmen control the state, and the two political parties that take turns running the state. It's in these businessmen's interests for people to believe that Black unemployment in Illinois is three times that of white people and twice the rate of Hispanics because of some flaw in Black culture. The flaw is in the system of capitalism as it actually exists in a thoroughly racist United States.

Donald Trump's Corporate Bait-and-Switch
A new report by Public Citizen shows 70 percent of Donald Trump's presidential transition ""landing team"" members are affiliated with corporations. Trump's rank-and-file supporters should be ""furious that here we have corporate insider after corporate insider taking over the administration,"" said Public Citizen research director Rick Claypool. Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs banker slated to become Secretary of the Treasury, ""is the appointment we would expect a president to have picked, if he intends to forge a plutocratic alliance"" with Wall Street, said Claypool, who warned: ""We can expect a return to the kind of Wild West of anything goes risk-taking that led to the 2008 crisis.""

RICO Prosecutions as a Tool of Gentrification
""They came to my house in the pre-dawn hours with all the elements of war,"" said Paula, mother of one of 120 young men swept up in a police raid centered on two housing projects in The Bronx, last April, and charged with a wide range of crimes under RICO conspiracy laws. It was the biggest such sweep in New York City history – larger than a raid that netted 103 youths from two Harlem housing projects, in 2014. Paula has withheld her last name in fear of retaliation against her son, whose mental health has deteriorated under solitary confinement. ""They are not mafia, as they are charged under RICO,"" she said. ""None of these youth had arsenals of firearms."" Most had no money for defense lawyers. Paula sees the raids as part of gentrification pressures to empty public housing. Many of the mothers, she said, ""have their sons in jail and, at the same time, they're going through an eviction process.

""Trump says he wants to cooperate with the Syrians and the Russians to defeat ISIS.""
With so many people who call themselves liberals and leftists tearing their hair out in dread of a President Donald Trump, it is necessary to point out that the prospects of avoiding nuclear war are much better than they were the day before the election. Hillary Clinton was committed to imposing a ""no fly zone"" over Syria that would have meant instant war with Russia, likely resulting in the annihilation of the human species. You'd think that would have made Clinton anathema to decent people. But Americans, including those who call themselves liberals, are not decent people – not really. Based on their political behavior, they just pretend to be decent, but support U.S. governments that have slaughtered millions since the end of World War Two. If you voted for Obama and Clinton, you gave your assent to continuing George Bush's wars, allowing Obama to start two major wars of his own, in Libya and Syria, and to Hillary Clinton's plans to roll the nuclear dice on the fate of humanity. The whole world knows that Americans are dangerous, to themselves and to others. But, decent? Since when, and to whom?
Donald Trump looks and talks like the ugly, racist, bullying American -- and he is exactly that, but he hasn't killed anybody yet, and his public statements have been of a far more peaceful nature than the woman he beat at the polls. Trump says he wants to cooperate with the Syrians and the Russians to defeat ISIS. Trump also does not make distinctions between the various Islamic jihadist groups in Syria, unlike the Obama administration, which has directly and indirectly armed and funded all of the jihadist groups, and has spent much of the last several months trying to protect the al Nusra Front, the al Qaida affiliate in eastern Aleppo, from Russian bombing. 
""The jihadists are in despair, and the prospects for driving them out of Aleppo look promising.""
No sooner had the votes been counted, than President Obama ordered U.S. Special Forces to go all-out to kill the leadership of al-Nusra. 
This war has been entirely based on lies, so Obama will probably limit his Kill List to al Qaida leaders, while sparing the rank and file jihadist fighters for future use by the United States. But it is safe to say that, had Hillary Clinton been elected, the most warlike factions in the U.S. military, the CIA, the State Department, and the foreign policy establishment at-large would be setting the stage for full-scale confrontation with Russia and all of Syria's allies under President Clinton. Instead, the jihadists are in despair, and the prospects for driving them out of Aleppo look promising. Hopefully, the Syrian government and its friends will be on the road to victory before Donald Trump's presidency is decisively captured by the bipartisan War Party that runs the empire. 
Syrian President Bashar Assad says it's fine with him if Trump wants to fight the terrorists. But, Assad isn't sure that Trump can deliver on his campaign pledge. ""What about the countervailing forces within the administration, the mainstream media that were against him?"" Assad asks. Assad thinks the notion of Trump bucking the War Party is ""dubious."" He's right. Half a million Syrians are dead because most Americans don't much care who their government kills, as long as they're not white. But, getting rid of Clinton has slowed the War Party down a bit, and maybe prevented a nuclear war. If you are a decent person, you should be pleased about that.

Cornel West: Class Becoming ""Much More Central""
""We are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era,"" said Dr. Cornel West, the nation's most prominent Black public intellectual, assessing the import of last week's election. West backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, then endorsed the Green Party's presidential ticket. The election ""did not go left-populist, following Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein,"" he said. Instead, ""it went rightwing-fascist. But the neoliberal era is coming to a close and the neoliberal establishment is being exposed. The issues of class now are becoming much more central.""
Trump Supporters Mounted an ""Insurrection"" 
Duboisian scholar Dr. Anthony Monteiro was among the few observers on the Left that thought Donald Trump would win at the polls. But, even he was startled at the scope of Trump's sweep. ""I felt that the insurgency would grow and deepen, but I never thought that it would become an insurrection,"" said Monteiro. ""In a certain sense, white working and poor people in these small, rust belt towns have a sense of achievement in having brought the Clintons down that Black people had in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected with a huge Black turnout,"" he said. Monteiro is one of the organizers of a Conference on Political Science for Radical Times, set for December 9-10, in Philadelphia.
TPP ""On Its Death Bed""
With Donald Trump's victory, President Obama's Trans Pacific Partnership corporate rights trade deal is ""looking like it's on its death bed,"" said Kevin Zeese, of Popular Resistance. ""We've worked for five years to make TPP stand for Toxic Political Poison, and that seems to have happened,"" said Zeese. Trump won in ""the rust belt that was destroyed by NAFTA"" -- Bill Clinton's jobs-exporting bill of a generation ago -- ""and was going to be threatened again by TPP."" Zeese said Obama may make a last bid to pass TPP in the lame duck session of Congress that begins this week.
Finally, a Practical Guide to Black Self-Determination
The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations adopted a 19-point Black Political Agenda for Self-Determination, at a conference in Washington. The document applies the principle of self-determination to the broadest range of issues, from Black Community Control of the Police, to Mass Black Incarceration, to Nationalization of the Banks. ""Everybody wants self-determination,"" said Coalition chairman Omali Yeshitela, ""but what does it mean, practically?"" The 19 points give direction to the struggle. ""This isn't something you work on every four years,"" said Yeshitela. ""This is something you work on every day. This is our program.""
Margaret Kimberley, an editor and senior columnist for Black Agenda Report, told the conference: ""When we meet together, today, we are showing the world what self-determination looks like."" Voting for ""your enemies"" is not self-determination, and ""thinking that electoral politics is the only road to liberation is not self-determination,"" said Kimberley.

ACA ""was never designed for affordability -- it's a misnomer in the name of the bill,"" he said. Obamacare is ""imploding and beyond repair,"" and unsustainable. ""Tweeks cannot work in the long term. The main fight should be for what will save money and give universal coverage to everyone: namely, single payer national health insurance.""

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The Lords of Capital are creatures of U.S. imperial dominance; they go out of business when the empire does.""
By virtually every measurement, the United States is in deep crisis, as both a society and as the headquarters of global capitalism. We can roughly measure the severity of some aspects of the crisis with the tools of economic analysis.  Such an analysis is quite useful in explaining why Washington is so eager to risk war with Russia and China, whether in Syria or the South China Sea or along the ever expanding borders of NATO. To put it simply, the U.S. and western Europe become smaller, in terms of their economic influence, with every passing day, and cannot possibly maintain their political dominance in the world except by military force, coercion and terror. Those are the only cards the imperialists have left to play. The ruling circles in the U.S. are aware that time is not on their side, and it makes them crazy -- or crazier than usual. 
The ruling class's own analysts tell them that the center of the world economy is moving inexorably to the East and the South; that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future; and that the U.S. is already number two by some economic measures -- and dropping. The Lords of Capital know there is no future for them in a world where the dollar is not supreme and where Wall Street's stocks, bonds and derivatives are not backed by full weight of unchallenged empire. Put another way, U.S. imperialism is at an inflection point, with all the indicators pointing downward and no hope of reversing the trend by peaceful means. 
Now, that's actually not such a bad prognosis for the United States, as a country. The U.S. is a big country, with an abundance of human and natural resources, and would do just fine in a world among equals. But, the fate of the Lords of Capital is tied to the ongoing existence of empire. They create nothing, but seek to monetize and turn a profit on everything. They cannot succeed in trade unless it is rigged, and have placed bets in their casinos that are nominally seven times more valuable than the total economic activity of planet Earth. In short, the Lords of Capital are creatures of U.S. imperial dominance; they go out of business when the empire does.
Beat the Clock 
The rulers are looking class death in the face -- and it terrifies them. And when the Lords of Capital become frightened, they order their servants in politics and the war industries and the vast national security networks to take care of the problem, by any means necessary. That means militarily encircling Russia and China; arming and mobilizing tens of thousands of jihadist terrorists in Syria, in an attempt to repeat the regime change in Libya; waging a war of economic sanctions and low-level armed aggression against Iran; occupying most of the African continent through subversion of African militaries; escalating subversion in Latin America; and spying on everyone on earth with a digital connection. All this, to stop the clock that is ticking on U.S. and European world economic dominance. 
Left political analysts that I greatly respect argue that Hillary Clinton and the mob she will come in with in January will pull back from apocalyptic confrontation with Russia in Syria -- that they're not really that crazy. But, I'm not at all convinced. The ruling class isn't just imagining that their days are numbered; it's really true. And rulers do get crazy when their class is standing at death's door.

The Missing Black Movement Ingredient: Self-Determination
The Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations will hold a National Black Political Convention on Self-Determination, November 5 and 6, in Washington, DC. ""If you go through history, the fundamental thing that we've confronted is the loss of our self-determination as a people,"" said Black Is Back chairman Omali Yeshitela. The Coalition has put forward a 19-point position on the need to put self-determination at the center of Black struggles. The 19 points ""give us the beginning of some kind of a plan,"" said Yeshitela. ""It says, specifically, here is our view on self-determination and the subject of reparations, Black women, the question of police invasion and brutality in our community,"" and many other issues. 
The ""Moment of Truth"" for the Empire
""We are entering a new moment in American history,"" said Dr. Anthony Monteiro, the Duboisian scholar and Black Radical Organizing Committee activist. ""It is a moment of truth for the ruling class, for the ruling elite. What do they do when they are trumped at home -- forgive the pun -- and trumped internationally?"" he asked. ""Do they back off of empire, do they readjust, do they become peaceful, or do they up the stakes and attempt to resolve all problems with war abroad and oppression at home?"" Dr. Monteiro is one of the planners of a Revolutionary Science for Radical Times conference, in Philadelphia, December 9 and 10.
Hard Times in Venezuela
Despite what the corporate media are telling you, Venezuelans are not starving and the Socialist Party government will not be toppled any time soon. However, the rightwing opposition ""is smelling blood"" due to an economic crisis that ""has made it very difficult for people to get access to imported goods, and many goods are very expensive,"" said political science professor George Caccariello-Maher, of Drexel University, author of We Created Chavez: A People's History of the Venezuelan Revolution. Corruption, smuggling and money speculation are serious problems, said Caccariello-Maher. However, the strength of the Left lies in the nation's grassroots organizations and communes. ""It would be very difficult for an opposition government to come in and attempt to throw them off their land"" or return property to the private sector, he said.
Happy Birthday, Rev. Pinkney!
Benton Harbor, Michigan, human rights leader Rev. Edward Pinkney, currently serving a 2 ½ to 10 year sentence on election tampering charges, turned 68 years old this month. Marcina Cole, a courtroom observer at Pinkney's trial, teamed up with David Sole, of the Michigan Emergency Committee Against War and Injustice, to throw a birthday party for Pinkney, in absentia, in Detroit. ""He's definitely in support of other inmates, doing ministry work, and looking forward to being out very soon,"" said Cole. She reported that Green Party vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka visited the political prisoner on October 19. ""This was historical,"" said Cole. ""They know how powerful Rev. Pinkney is"" -- and that he has allies on the outside.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Of the six cases that are currently, or soon to be, on the docket of the ICC, all involve indictments against Africans.""
After 14 years, the neocolonial judicial farce of an International Criminal Court may be unraveling. South Africa has joined Burundi in serving notice that it is starting the process of withdrawing from the ICC. The decision by President Jacob Zuma's government has caused panic in the West, which fears it might touch off a mass withdrawal of Africans from the ICC at the African Union Summit meeting, in January. There were similar fears of a mass African walk-out when the ICC indicted Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta for crimes against humanity, in 2012. The International Criminal Court dropped those charges two years later.
From its very inception, in 2002, the ICC has been a court for Africans only, a tool of the United States and the former colonial powers. Of the six cases that are currently, or soon to be, on the docket of the ICC, all involve indictments against Africans. It is as if the only high-placed criminal politicians in the world live in Africa. 
South Africa says it is saying goodbye to the ICC because the court interferes with its national sovereignty. For example, South Africa styles itself as a peace-maker on the continent, and reserves the right to host talks between feuding parties, even if one of them has been charged with crimes by the ICC. Such was the case when Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir visited South Africa, last year. 
In Rwanda, the International Criminal Court has acted as a prosecutorial service Paul Kagame, the Tutsi dictator. Despite abundant evidence that Hutus were also massacred during the Rwandan civil war, and that Kagame's forces deliberately provoked the bloodbath, the ICC prosecuted only Hutus and opponents of the Kagame regime. 
""Washington is not even a member of the ICC -- and never will be, since the U.S. is unwilling to be judged by any global authority.""
This year, the ICC seemed to be getting ready to indict the current Hutu president of Burundi, Pierre Nkurunziza, who has been targeted for regime change by Rwanda and its super-power protector, the United States. That's when Nkurunziza decided to get out of the ICC.
The U.S. is the most hypocritical player of all, when it comes to the International Criminal Court. Washington is not even a member of the ICC -- and never will be, since the U.S. is unwilling to be judged by any global authority. The U.S. voted against creation of the court when the issue came up for a vote at the United Nations, in 1998. Yet, Washington uses the ICC as a threat against African leaders that resist U.S. domination – like Burundi's President Nkurunziza.
South African President Jacob Zuma can count on his African National Congress legislative majority to support a withdrawal from the ICC. It's a welcome move on Zuma's part, but it doesn't make up for South Africa's vote, five years ago in the UN Security Council, for a ""no-fly zone"" over Libya. That shameful surrender to U.S. pressure resulted in the overthrow and death Muammar Gadaffi, a great friend and material supporter of the South African liberation movement. Let's hope that Zuma is now signaling that he will pursue a foreign policy that is more independent of the United States.

20 Years of Genocide in Congo
Friends of Congo marked the 20th anniversary of the invasion and genocide that has killed at least six million Congolese with an all-day event at Thoughtworks, in New York City. ""We're not just fighting against our own government,"" said Nita Evele, of the Congo Global Action Coalition.

On the same weekend that the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding, in Oakland, California, hundreds gathered to roast and toast former Party chairman Bobby Seale on his 80th birthday. Seale put forward a far less revolutionary version of the Party's origins and history. ""When we went out there to patrol the police, it was a tactic to capture the imagination of the people,"" he told the crowd. However, it was Seale's intent all along to ""organize a political-electoral unit and to take over some of these damn cities. My objective was to get more Black politicians, and that's what happened."" Seale also supports Hillary Clinton for president.
Better a Dog Than Clinton for President, Says Haiti Activist
""The only reason that Hillary Clinton is not in jail; the only reason that the Clinton Foundation is not shut down, is precisely because they are protected by the highest levels of government,"" said Daoud Andre, a Haitian community activist and radio host in New York City. Andre said the Clintons have stolen billions from the Haitian people. ""It's like Barack Obama gave Haiti to the Clintons as a gift,"" he said. ""With regard to this election, whatever is able to stop Hillary Clinton, we have to support that; if it's a dog running against Hillary Clinton, you have to vote for that dog because of the harm that this family has caused to our people.""
Theater in the Service of the Struggle
The National Black Theater, in New York's Harlem, hosted a radical political theatrical production titled ""Survival Crimes,"" produced by the Campaign to Bring Mumia Home and the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC).

Activist Kyle Fraser said the play points out the ""theatrics of the state, swooping in with helicopters to this neighborhood, using Shock and Awe tactics,"" and perverting the rule of law in the Pennsylvania prison system.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Having no real defense against the obvious, the Clinton campaign and most of the corporate media painted Wikileaks as an arm of Russian intelligence.""
Let's get to the point of this commentary right up front: political discourse in the United States is devoid of substance because the people who own the country and its media can no longer justify their continued rule. Capitalism -- in deep and irreversible decline, dominated by a financial class that makes nothing but exotic forms of money -- has nothing to offer the vast bulk of the people, and no solutions for any of the multiplying crises it has created. Having no real program to offer the public, the rulers and their media have no choice but to shut down any semblance of substantive political debate.
In this presidential season most of the ruling class is gathered under Hillary Clinton's Big Tent. Republican Donald Trump is on the outs, despite his billionaire status, because he has violated several sacred taboos of the One Percent. I'm not talking about his racism -- race is central to politics in the U.S. Trump's heresy is that he has challenged rich people's right to take their money and the nation's jobs, overseas. And Trump has questioned U.S. policies of endless war, regime change, and demonization of Russia. 
The truth is, most Americans oppose the deindustrialization of their country, and they know who is responsible: Wall Street. And most Americans do not want to live in a world that is constantly on the brink of war. Even Donald Trump's white nationalists yearn for some global peace and quiet and an economy with good jobs for average (white) people. 
""Trump has violated sacred taboos of the One Percent.""
Hillary Clinton is deservedly known as both a warmonger and a shameless supplicant of Wall Street, whereas Trump exhibits no loyalties to anyone but himself.  Wikileaks has done periodic dumps of documents proving, in Clinton and her handlers' own words, that she is a servant of the ruling class. Having no real defense against the obvious, the Clinton campaign and most of the corporate media painted Wikileaks as an arm of Russian intelligence. The purpose of this New McCarthyism was to inoculate the public against believing Clinton's own words, as they were spoken to bankers, and at the same time discredit Trump's position that the U.S. should seek better relations with Russia and stop helping jihadists in Syria.  Having no intention to offer peace to the American people or stop supporting the jihadists, the ruling class shut down the conversation.
The New York Times stooped to new lows of Zionistic McCarthyism, last week, when it used the broad brush of anti-Semitism to slime Donald Trump's critique of what he called a ""global elite"" that had ""stripped"" the U.S. of its wealth in order to line the pockets of corporate and political interests. He said Hillary Clinton ""meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors."" Actually, this is provably true about Hillary Clinton and her past support for so-called free trade – and it's how today's capitalist system works, in general. Socialists, and even left liberals, make the same case all the time. But such talk is now verboten, prohibited because the New York Times tells us that anti-Semites like to say such things about ""the Jews.""
So, even for mega-capitalists like Trump, critiques of capitalism are beyond the pale – unspeakable.

Glen Ford: If Trump is a Fascist, What is Clinton?
Speaking to a gathering of the Georgia Peace and Justice Coalition, in Atlanta, Black Agenda Report executive editor Glen Ford challenged those who maintain that progressives are obligated to support Hillary Clinton for president to counter a ""fascist"" threat from Donald Trump. ""I'd like to know how Donald Trump is supposed to build fascism when the ruling class is mostly with the Democrats this election season,"" said Ford. ""If you are worried about 21st century fascism, you need to check out the tent where the ruling class congregates -- and that's Hillary's tent. Most of all, if you're looking for fascists, go to the sound of the war drums"" -- which are also pounding in Hillary's tent. For voters that are looking for a real anti-fascist and pro-peace presidential ticket, the only choice on the ballot in most states is Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka, of the Green Party, said Ford.

""These are states with high rates of incarceration and, as is true in every state, the rate of incarceration of African Americans dwarfs that of whites, usually by about a five to one ratio,"" said Project executive director Marc Mauer. ""The combined effect of high rates of incarceration and the fact that many, if not most, of the people who have completed their sentences are still disenfranchised means that it is a lifetime ban."" Mauer said the U.S. stands alone among industrialized countries in its zeal to disenfranchise ex-felons. ""Nothing we know of comes close to this.""

104037195986_10154543332595987,"Soft Porn Tape Trumps Wikileaks Truths: Hillary's ""Private"" Lies Prevail
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Even Santa Claus would get outsourced in Hillary's vision of 'free trade.'""
There was never any real doubt that Hillary Clinton would defeat Donald Trump. Indeed, from the Democrats' standpoint, Trump was the ideal candidate. Wikileaks documents show that the Democratic National Committee wanted the Republicans to put forward as right-wing a candidate as possible, so that Clinton, who represents the right wing of the Democratic Party, would look good by comparison. 
Clinton has long been the favorite of the corporate media, and her best TV friends are at NBC. The network had known for months about the 11-year-old tape in which its current employee, Billy Bush, a cousin and nephew of two presidents, joined with Trump in piggish banter degrading women. NBC chose to release the tape at precisely the right moment to suck the air out of a new batch of Wikileaks documents that could have been catastrophic for the Clinton campaign. As a result, everybody and their mother knows that Trump brags about grabbing women's private parts, but far fewer folks learned what Clinton said to those bankers and other One Percenters that have paid her $26 million for private speeches. If the contents of her bankster speeches had been divulged at the height of her primary race against Bernie Sanders, Clinton would never have won the nomination, because they reveal her as a methodical, cynical liar who wants to cut Social Security and send millions more jobs overseas.
Clinton told the bankers at Morgan Stanley that she agreed with the co-chairs of President Obama's Deficit Reduction Commission, who proposed cutting Social Security and making Americans wait longer to collect their benefits. She called that ""the right framework"" to ""restrain spending"" and ""incentivize growth""
To earn her $200,000-plus check, Clinton confided to Brazilian bankers that her ""dream"" is ""a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders"" -- that is, a kind of super-NAFTA agreement that stretches from the North Pole to the South Pole. Even Santa Claus would get outsourced in Hillary's vision of ""free trade.""
Inoculated Against Truth
Clinton told a bunch of real estate developers that rich folks like themselves shouldn't take her public speeches to the Democratic masses too literally. Her years in politics have taught her, she said, that ""you need both a public and a private position."" She is telling the rich and powerful not to worry, because she will protect their interests while lying to the people. 
Had NBC not pushed the Wikileaks story to the side with their soft-porn Trump tape, Clinton's candidacy would have been gravely wounded. But, the Democrats and their corporate media allies have convinced many Americans that everything from Wikileaks is a Russian trick, including documents that come straight from the desk of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta, and which Podesta does not deny are his. Much of the public has been inoculated against any bombshells of truth from Wikileaks. And if any truth threatens to break through, then the media will find some other way to change the subject, because Big Media are a part of the filthy rich that hope to benefit from Hillary's ""private"" positions and public lies.

Reparations a Necessity to Correct America's Crimes
The United Nations panel of experts that blasted the U.S. for its ""legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality"" had no choice but to call for reparations for people of African descent, said Kamm Howard, of NCOBRA, the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America. ""The international community recognizes that reparations is pretty much mandatory when a state has committed those types of crimes,"" said Howard. ""You have to repair the injury, you have to make the people whole, because these types of injuries are long term and, generally, self-perpetuating.""
Ajamu Baraka: Bush and Obama Backed Jihadist Forces
""This country and the world is more dangerous as a consequence of the rampage the U.S. has been involved in in the so-called Middle East,"" said Green Party vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka. Speaking on Democracy Now!'s ""Expanded Debates,"" Baraka said both Republicans and Democrats are responsible for the rise of Islamic jihadism. ""Under the Bush administration, there was a conscious decision to utilize jihadist forces to advance U.S. policies,"" he said. ""That policy was continued under the Obama administration. We see the blowback happening across the world.""
Crying Wolf on Fascism
""This notion that we're going to have a white nationalist fascist takeover in this election, and that we all need to go running to this rightwing fanatic, this arch-corporatist, this lying neoliberal warmonger"" -- Hillary Clinton – ""is not sticking with a lot of people on the Left,"" said historian and political analyst Paul Street. Part of the reason is that ""Clinton has such a long and unambiguous track record of really vanguard neoliberalism,"" said Street. The Clintons ""led the way for the rightward drift of the Democratic Party.""
Nat Turner as Revolutionary Organizer
The slave revolt that swept through Southampton County, Virginia, in 1831, in which about 60 whites were killed and hundreds of Blacks were hanged or murdered in retaliation, was ""far more than an impulsive lashing out against mistreatment,"" said Dr. Melvin Peters, associate professor of African American Studies at the University of Eastern Michigan. Turner was a man of ""unparalleled leadership,"" said Peters. ""When Turner called out to the recruits, his six men grew to at least 60, maybe 80 freedom fighters, including free Blacks."" Slave insurrections also broke out ""all around the Dismal Swamp, even down to Wilmington, North Carolina, in the same time period --- so much so, that they appeared to be coordinated.""
Black Colombians Favored Peace Deal
""The majority of the 'Yes' vote came from Afro-descended territories and from those territories where war has hit most strongly at communities,"" said Afro-Colombian human rights activist Charo Mina-Rojas. The agreement that would have ended the half-century-long war between FARC guerillas and the Colombian government was narrowly defeated in a referendum, last month. The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands and left more than five million homeless, the majority of them Black. Mina-Rojas called the vote a victory for ""the elite."" ""We were not shocked,"" she said.

Murder by Occupation: Tulsa 2016, Baghdad 2007
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""That looks like a bad dude.""
The narrators of the murder were high in the sky, circling the scene of the unfolding, racist crime in their police helicopter. Down below, a large Black man named Terence Crutcher was standing with his hands up next to his disabled car. Four Tulsa, Oklahoma cops had arrayed themselves like a firing squad; one of them, Officer Betty Shelby, was the wife of Dave Shelby, one of the cops in the helicopter. From his elevated vantage point, Officer Dave Shelby provided the voice-over to Terence Crutcher's last moments of life. ""He's got his hands up there for her now,"" said Shelby. ""This guy is still walking and following commands.""
You'd think that was a good thing. But, the other cop chimes in immediately: ""Time for a Taser, I think."" Officer Shelby says, ""I got a feeling that's about to happen."" His partner clearly wants some damage done to the Black man, below. ""That looks like a bad dude, too,"" he said. ""Could be on something,"" he adds -- already providing some kind of drug-crazed justification for the murder that his fellow cops are about to commit. Then, with heaven and her husband Dave watching, Officer Betty Shelby blows Terence Crutcher away. The two cops in the helicopter express no surprise, no shock, no emotion whatsoever. As Terence Crutcher lays dying, the first thing out of Officer Dave Shelby's mouth was about re-routing traffic around the killing zone.
The helicopter police voice-over of Terence Crutcher's execution was a ghastly reminder of the video released by Wikileaks of a 2007 mass murder of Iraqi civilians by U.S. helicopter gun crews over Baghdad. The Americans were engaged in what I'm sure some of them called ""hajji-hunting,"" which is the same as what the good ole boys back home call ""coon-hunting"" -- searching for colored folks to kill. Circling unseen way above the city, the Americans opened fire at an innocent group of unarmed men on a street corner. 
Mission Unjustifiable
""Keep shootin. Keep shootin'. Keep shootin'. Keep shootin',"" hollered one of the killers. ""Oh, yeah, look at those dead bastards,"" said his partner. ""Nice. Good shootin',"" the other soldier complimented his accomplice in murder. But they weren't through, yet. The gunship then attacked a van driven by a father with two of his children inside. The voice of American Soldier #1 is heard saying, ""Well, it's their fault for bringing their kids into a battle."" 
These voices over Baghdad and Tulsa speak the same language: the language of Occupation. When spoken by Americans, this language is always racist, but it also has its own, particular quality of horror. Occupations are always justified as ""peace-keeping"" missions. Domestic occupiers are called ""peace"" officers. But their mission is war against a civilian population -- to inflict preemptive terror on an entire mass of people. Since the actual mission cannot be justified, the Occupiers lie to themselves and everybody else about the real nature of their mission. In the end, the Occupied peoples have no choice but to expel their tormentors, or become as insane and morally degraded as they are. This applies just as much in Tulsa as it does in Baghdad. We need Black community control of the police, and an end to the Occupation.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Duterte does not accept being lectured to by the United States, a country with so much Filipino blood on its hands.""
Don't be surprised if Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte winds up being overthrown or murdered by his own military or national police, acting on behalf of the United States. All most Americans know about President Duterte is that he called President Obama a ""son of a whore"" – a term Duterte throws around a lot. Duterte later clarified his remarks, saying the object of his anger wasn't Obama, personally, but ""America,"" in general. And, that's quite understandable, because the United States killed as many as one million Filipinos when it colonized the country back in 1898, and still treats the island nation of about 100 million people like a colony. The U.S. holds great influence with the Filipino military, which operates in close collaboration with U.S. Special Forces troops stationed in the country.
Duterte started cursing when he was told that Obama was planning to lecture him at the G-20 Summit meeting in Laos, last week. Duterte does not accept being lectured to by the United States, a country with so much Filipino blood on its hands. Obama, who has ordered the death of tens of thousands in the bombing of six countries, was preparing to criticize Duterte's policy of killing accused drug dealers on-the-spot, which has so far resulted in about 3,000 deaths. When the Philippines president found out that he was in for a scolding, he exploded:
""You must be kidding,"" he said. ""Who is he to confront me? America has one too many to answer for the misdeeds in this country … As a matter of fact, we inherited this problem"" – meaning, the drug problem – ""from the United States. Why? Because they invaded this country and made us their subjugated people … Can I explain the extrajudicial killing? Can they explain the 600,000 Moro massacred in this island?"" Duterte was speaking of Mindanao, where he was born.
Americans = No Peace
The U.S. troop presence inflames tensions with the local Muslim population. ""The special forces, they have to go,"" he said. ""They have to go in Mindanao, there are many whites there."" 
But, the Black Americans have to go, too. ""For as long as we stay with America,"" said the Philippine president, ""we will never have peace in that land."" 
Duterte thinks Obama has some nerve waving his finger about ""human rights."" 
""Why are you Americans killing the black people there, shooting them down when they are already on the ground?"" he asked. 
Duterte is popular with his people largely because he is not a puppet of the United States. He calls himself a socialist, and has honored an extended cease fire in the nearly 50-year war with communist guerillas. Duterte says he may begin buying weapons from Russia and China, who offer ""soft loans"" and better terms. He said he will stop allowing joint patrols of Philippine and U.S. naval forces in the South China sea, and will ""follow an independent foreign policy."" And, Duterte says his country doesn't need American F-16 jets and other expensive weapons. 
This is more than enough to get him killed, most likely by the Philippines military, But the hit will be commissioned by the United States, which is not about to allow a president of one of its former colonies to stand in the way of America's ""pivot"" to Asia and looming confrontation with the China.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by BAR executive editor Glen Ford
""Trump might do the right thing, but only to protect his own fragile ego.""
On Tuesday night, just as I was preparing to do a commentary on whether Donald Trump might threaten to drop out of the televised debates if the candidates for the Green and Libertarian Parties weren't allowed to participate, I ran across a story that claimed Trump had already done just that. A website called the Santa Monica Observer reported the Trump decision as fact, but without naming a source. Nobody else ran the story, and the Trump campaign said it wasn't true, so it was probably a hoax. However, a Trump threat to boycott the debates remains a tantalizing prospect, given that, back in 2000, he said it was ""disgraceful"" that the Democrats and Republicans were able to shut the smaller parties out of the presidential debates. Green Party campaign senior advisor Kevin Zeese has all but dared Trump to live up to his principled stance of 16 years ago.
Principles aside, Trump has some self-centered reasons to want Jill Stein and Gary Johnson standing next to him and Hillary on September 26th. Very few Green Party supporters would vote for Trump under any circumstances, so a good showing by Stein doesn't come at his expense. But, according to recent polls, voters that now plan to pull the lever for Gary Johnson's Libertarian campaign would otherwise be split about evenly between Trump and Clinton.  Therefore, Trump would appear to have a relative net advantage over Clinton if there were a vigorous, four-way presidential contest.
""Back in 2000, Trump said it was 'disgraceful' that the Democrats and Republicans were able to shut the smaller parties out of the presidential debates.""
I personally don't think that such mathematical calculations are central to the way Donald Trump thinks. He really is a narcissist who always talks about winning and can't stand to lose. And, unless that comb-over has affected his brain cells, he should know that Clinton is even better at lying on her feet than he is. She studies her lies, while Trump just makes things up as he goes along. If Trump becomes convinced that he is going to lose this election badly or be humiliated in the debates, he will seek to muddy the waters by introducing other actors into the contest, so that Clinton can't say she beat him one-on-one. That is, he'll do the right thing, and call for Stein and Johnson's participation in the debates, but only in order to protect his own fragile ego. Right now, some polls are showing Trump even with Clinton, which is probably bad news for Stein and Johnson's chances of getting in the first debate – but that could change quickly.
There is little hope that Stein and Johnson will average 15 percent in the polls – the arbitrary cut-off the Republicans and Democrats have imposed to keep third parties out. That's because the media corporations that both commission the polls and monopolize the news dedicate only one half of one percent of their election coverage to the Green and Libertarian Parties. As a result, about one-third of the public has never even heard of Jill Stein or Gary Johnson. This is what elections have come to in an age when monopoly capital has a monopoly on information and defines what is and isn't news and who is and isn't worthy of public office. Both Trump and Clinton are products of this dictatorship of capital. It's a crime that Jill Stein and Gary Johnson won't be seen by the debate's huge audience unless Donald Trump is convinced he can't win.

20th Anniversary of Clinton's War Against the Poor
It's been 20 years since President Bill Clinton and the U.S. Congress destroyed ""welfare as we knew it"" by replacing Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with the ""workfare"" regime called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The result, said Maureen Taylor, chairperson of the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, is growing poverty in the United States. Taylor says TANF should be changed to DANF, standing for ""Disappearing Aid for Needy Families."" Residents of Michigan are only eligible for cash assistance for five years in their lifetimes. It's a shame, said Taylor, how the political class is ""turning, not against poverty, but trying to turn the nation against poor folks.""
Judge Finds Way to Avoid Ordering Hep C Cure for Mumia
A federal judge agreed that it is unconstitutional for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to deny curative medical treatment to Mumia Abu Jamal and thousands of other prisoners suffering from Hepatitis C. However, the court then ruled that Abu Jamal's suit was technically flawed. Noelle Hanrahan, a director of Prison Radio who works closely with Mumia, was outraged that the state has condemned thousands of prisoners to early and unnecessary deaths. ""You can't construct a situation that is more grossly inhumane,"" she said.
Abu Jamal, the nation's best known political prisoner, was more upbeat about the ruling. ""It's a good beginning that a federal judge recognizes that what the Commonwealth is doing, and has been doing for years, is not only unjust but unconstitutional, a violation of fundamental fairness and the human right to life,"" he said. 
Clinton and Trump Fear TV Debate with Stein and Johnson

Zeese notes that polls show half the American public wants the televised debates open to Stein and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate. However, the debates are a joint venture of the Democratic and Republican parties, who call the shots. ""It's a disgrace to democracy,"" said Zeese, ""that they can choose who they will debate.""

20th Anniversary of Clinton's War Against the Poor
It's been 20 years since President Bill Clinton and the U.S. Congress destroyed ""welfare as we knew it"" by replacing Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with the ""workfare"" regime called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The result, said Maureen Taylor, chairperson of the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, is growing poverty in the United States. Taylor says TANF should be changed to DANF, standing for ""Disappearing Aid for Needy Families."" Residents of Michigan are only eligible for cash assistance for five years in their lifetimes. It's a shame, said Taylor, how the political class is ""turning, not against poverty, but trying to turn the nation against poor folks.""
Judge Finds Way to Avoid Ordering Hep C Cure for Mumia
A federal judge agreed that it is unconstitutional for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to deny curative medical treatment to Mumia Abu Jamal and thousands of other prisoners suffering from Hepatitis C. However, the court then ruled that Abu Jamal's suit was technically flawed. Noelle Hanrahan, a director of Prison Radio who works closely with Mumia, was outraged that the state has condemned thousands of prisoners to early and unnecessary deaths. ""You can't construct a situation that is more grossly inhumane,"" she said.
Abu Jamal, the nation's best known political prisoner, was more upbeat about the ruling. ""It's a good beginning that a federal judge recognizes that what the Commonwealth is doing, and has been doing for years, is not only unjust but unconstitutional, a violation of fundamental fairness and the human right to life,"" he said. 
Clinton and Trump Fear TV Debate with Stein and Johnson
""Our view is that if you have the potential for 270 Electoral College votes -- if you are on enough ballots to achieve that -- then you should be in the debate,"" said Kevin Zeese, the veteran activist recently named as senior advisor to the Green Party's Jill Stein-Ajamu Baraka presidential ticket. Zeese notes that polls show half the American public wants the televised debates open to Stein and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate. However, the debates are a joint venture of the Democratic and Republican parties, who call the shots. ""It's a disgrace to democracy,"" said Zeese, ""that they can choose who they will debate.""

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""There is no U.S. elections integrity for the Russians to destroy, even if they wanted to.""
Hillary Clinton is cold – not like ice, but like the Cold War. She will do anything to return to the White House, including risking thermonuclear war with Russia. Her ""Big Tent"" campaign apparatus is overflowing with an influx of the most warlike elements of both major parties, now united in a crusade to give Clinton a huge electoral mandate for global aggression. Clinton knows she can't get such a mandate simply by beating the pants off the amateur white nationalist, Donald Trump. All that would prove is that voters dislike her less than they dislike him -- which isn't saying much. To give her victory in November a truly triumphal character, she must be seen as saving the nation from an existential threat. Russia is easily made to fit the bill, as the nation that has been Uncle Sam's boogeyman for nearly a century. 
It's not so much that Clinton has linked Trump to Russia – but that she has smeared Russia with Trump. It is obvious that Clinton has been planning for years to ride into the White House on a warhorse. No sooner than she left the State Department, she was comparing President Vladimir Putin to Hitler. Now she's infected her entire Big Tent with rabies. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid is frothing at the mouth about a Russian threat to tamper with the 2016 elections. The Nevada senator cites remarks by former CIA chief Michael Morell, who combined his endorsement of Hillary with a charge that Donald Trump was an ""unwitting agent"" of Putin, and that Russian tampering with U.S. elections represents ""one of the gravest threats to our democracy since the Cold War."" Senator Reid fears the Russians might mess with elections in five or six states. He wants the FBI to open an investigation. FBI agents have told reporters that foreign hackers broke into voter files in two states: Arizona and Illinois. 
U.S. Elections are Shams
Of course, Trump doesn't work for anybody but himself, and the Russians are the last people that American voters have to fear. U.S. elections lack credibility because of endemic racism and corruption that is hardwired into the system, itself. Massive purges of Black voters in Florida and tampering with polling places in Black precincts in Ohio rendered invalid the results of the 2000 and 2004 elections. Yet, the Democrats did not protest the blatant tampering in 2000, and only one U.S. Senator, Barbara Boxer of California, challenged the results in 2004. The validity of U.S. elections has only gotten worse since then, with hundreds of Jim Crow-style voting restrictions introduced in virtually every state in the union. There is no U.S. elections integrity for the Russians to destroy, even if they wanted to.
The U.S., however, has interfered in Russia's elections, quite blatantly in 2012. In the period after World War Two, the U.S. sabotaged elections in France and Italy, trying to keep out the communists. Hillary Clinton's underling at the U.S. State Department, Victoria Nuland, bragged that the U.S. spent $5 billion interfering in Ukrainian politics, until finally engineering a coup that threw out the elected government. 
The United States has opposed democracy everywhere in the world. The rulers of this country do not want free and fair elections, at home or abroad. Neither does Hillary Clinton. She prefers war. And that's a cold fact.

Rights Lawyers Target Arkansas Debtors Prison
The district court in Sherwood, Arkansas, is in gross violation of a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court ruling against imprisoning people for debt, according to a class action suit filed by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Arkansas ACLU. Much like the pattern of abuse documented by a U.S. Justice Department in Ferguson, Missouri, Sherwood derives as much as 12 percent of its revenues from ""imposing mounting fines or fees tied to very low level offenses,"" said Lawyers Committee president Kristen Clarke. One of Clarke's clients wound up spending 25 days in jail and owing nearly $3,000 to the courts because she bounced a $28.93 check. ""Our hope is that we can bring national attention to this problem, and that we might inspire action by the Congress to breathe life back into this Supreme Court ruling,"" said Clarke.

104037195986_10154400231990987,"Katrina and Other Catastrophes
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The New Orleans model has gone national.""
Eleven years ago this week, Hurricane Katrina flooded 80 percent of New Orleans, killing at least 1,200 people – although no one will ever know the actual death toll because most of the victims were Black and poor and, therefore, were never considered important enough to count. 
What was important to the rulers of this country, in the aftermath of Katrina, was making sure that as many as possible of the displaced Black residents would not be allowed to return to the city. Before the waters had fully subsided, corporate planners were exulting in the opportunity to build a new New Orleans, a much whiter and richer metropolis. Katrina had ethnically cleansed the city -- permanently exiling 100,000 Blacks -- and the Lords of Capital could not contain their jubilation. What Blacks experienced as catastrophe was celebrated as a renaissance.
Katrina was a godsend for Disaster Capitalism, and provided a model for capitalists to create future disasters for Black people. President Obama's secretary of education, Arne Duncan, said Katrina was ""the best thing that happened to the education system in New Orleans"" because it allowed school privatizers to fire all of the city's teachers, 71 percent of them Black, and turn most of the schools into charters. Instead of firing Duncan for his outrageously callous and deeply racist remarks, President Obama joined in praising the so-called ""recovery"" of a city that had shed about a third of its Black population and was on the way to becoming the nation's first all-charter school system. Over the next several years, Obama's Race to the Top program would coerce states to create a ""market"" for charter schools or face the loss of federal education funds. Katrina paved the way to a catastrophe for public education, nationwide.
Black Caucus Muzzled, Easily
During the last weeks of the summer of 2005, when the magnitude of the disaster became apparent, it seemed that almost every Black community organization responded with some kind of Katrina support program. But, there was no political response from the Congressional Black Caucus, in Washington. The Democratic Party hoped to regain control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections, and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi didn't want the Party to appear too pro-Black. She ordered her members to boycott the Republicans' hearings on Katrina, and Democrats held no hearings of their own. In the face of what was then the greatest Black catastrophe of the 21st century, the Congressional Black Caucus allowed itself to be muzzled. 
The Black political class's abject failure to respond to Katrina guaranteed that there would be more catastrophes for Black folks. The Lords of Capital realized that, if they could get away with massive ethnic cleansing in New Orleans, while the whole world was watching, they could ratchet up the speed of gentrification and Black removal all across the country. Soon, half of the Black citizens of Michigan were disenfranchised by an emergency financial manager regime that took over all of the state's heavily Black cities. The New Orleans model has gone national, because the rulers of this country know that they don't need a storm to drive Black folks from the cities – and that there will be no resistance from a selfish, useless Black Misleadership Class.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The New Orleans model has gone national.""
Eleven years ago this week, Hurricane Katrina flooded 80 percent of New Orleans, killing at least 1,200 people – although no one will ever know the actual death toll because most of the victims were Black and poor and, therefore, were never considered important enough to count. 
What was important to the rulers of this country, in the aftermath of Katrina, was making sure that as many as possible of the displaced Black residents would not be allowed to return to the city. Before the waters had fully subsided, corporate planners were exulting in the opportunity to build a new New Orleans, a much whiter and richer metropolis. Katrina had ethnically cleansed the city -- permanently exiling 100,000 Blacks -- and the Lords of Capital could not contain their jubilation. What Blacks experienced as catastrophe was celebrated as a renaissance.
Katrina was a godsend for Disaster Capitalism, and provided a model for capitalists to create future disasters for Black people. President Obama's secretary of education, Arne Duncan, said Katrina was ""the best thing that happened to the education system in New Orleans"" because it allowed school privatizers to fire all of the city's teachers, 71 percent of them Black, and turn most of the schools into charters. Instead of firing Duncan for his outrageously callous and deeply racist remarks, President Obama joined in praising the so-called ""recovery"" of a city that had shed about a third of its Black population and was on the way to becoming the nation's first all-charter school system. Over the next several years, Obama's Race to the Top program would coerce states to create a ""market"" for charter schools or face the loss of federal education funds. Katrina paved the way to a catastrophe for public education, nationwide.
Black Caucus Muzzled, Easily
During the last weeks of the summer of 2005, when the magnitude of the disaster became apparent, it seemed that almost every Black community organization responded with some kind of Katrina support program. But, there was no political response from the Congressional Black Caucus, in Washington. The Democratic Party hoped to regain control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections, and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi didn't want the Party to appear too pro-Black. She ordered her members to boycott the Republicans' hearings on Katrina, and Democrats held no hearings of their own. In the face of what was then the greatest Black catastrophe of the 21st century, the Congressional Black Caucus allowed itself to be muzzled. 
The Black political class's abject failure to respond to Katrina guaranteed that there would be more catastrophes for Black folks. The Lords of Capital realized that, if they could get away with massive ethnic cleansing in New Orleans, while the whole world was watching, they could ratchet up the speed of gentrification and Black removal all across the country. Soon, half of the Black citizens of Michigan were disenfranchised by an emergency financial manager regime that took over all of the state's heavily Black cities. The New Orleans model has gone national, because the rulers of this country know that they don't need a storm to drive Black folks from the cities – and that there will be no resistance from a selfish, useless Black Misleadership Class.

Presidential Pollsters Ask the Wrong Question
""There's no major poll that I know of that asks the American public who they want to be president,"" said journalist and VotePact founder Sam Husseini. Instead, the five polling outfits that decide if candidates have enough support to appear in televised debates ask, ""If the election were held today, who would you vote for?""

Clintonites Play Foul Against Greens
Green Party vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka said so-called ""liberal"" Clinton supporters ""are trying to undermine the moral authority that we have as a campaign that stands up for the working class in this country to advance principles that transcend the limitations of liberalism; to talk about a new kind of democracy and an economic liberation that goes beyond the limitations of capitalism."" Baraka, a veteran human rights activist and editor at Black Agenda Report, said the Clintonites slime the Greens as part of the 'loony left' to ""try to undermine this oppositional moment.""
Black Is Back Coalition Stresses Centrality of Self-Determination
For decades, the conversation around Black liberation in the United States has been missing the critical element of self-determination, said Omali Yeshitela, chairman of the Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations. The movement that emerged in Ferguson in 2014 ""wasn't about body cameras, and it wasn't about police-community review boards. We criticized those who could not even make a demand on the system,"" Yeshitela told a gathering of the coalition, in Philadelphia. The coalition approved a list of 19 demands as the basis for a Black Agenda for Self Determination, to be submitted to the annual Black Is Back national conference in Washington, November 5 and 6. 
Ralph Poynter, the veteran activist and husband of people's lawyer and former political prisoner Lynne Stewart, assumed the chairmanship of the coalition's Political Prisoners Working Group. ""The modern death penalty -- 80 percent Black -- moved lynching indoors,"" said Poynter. ""The police, as the army of occupation, have taken lynching outside, again. The lynch mob is the racist system, including the courts and the media.""
Detroit Schools Activists Win Court Battle
A Michigan judge excoriated the state-run Detroit school district for attempting to bar Steve Conn and Nicole Conaway from advocating teacher strikes against the privatization and forced deterioration of the public schools. The district's request for an injunction against Conn, a former president of the local teachers union, and Conaway, of By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), was ""offensive to free speech,"" said the judge. ""We're certainly going to urge more protests to defeat the governor for destroying our schools,"" said Conn.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""In the year 2043, white households will already be a cool $1 million richer than Black households.""
No wonder there has been such an obscene growth in the Black ""prosperity"" church ministry. Study after study has shown that it will take a miracle for Black people in the United States to ever close the gap with whites in household wealth – that is, under the system of capitalism. The latest report on just how impossible that dream is, is titled the Ever Growing Gap. It was conducted by the Institute for Policy Studies and the Corporation for Enterprise Development, both located in Washington. Based on the steady erosion of Black and Latino household wealth compared to whites over the past 30 years, the authors project that it would take 228 years -- into the middle of the 23rd century -- for Black Americans to amass as much wealth as the median white household already possesses. Latinos are on a somewhat faster track; they would become as wealthy as present-day white families in the year 2097,.
Only 27 years from now, in the year 2043, when the U.S. Census Bureau projects that Blacks, Latinos and other people of color will outnumber white Anglos in the United States, white households will already be a cool $1 million richer than Black households, according to the new study. 
Dedrick Asante Muhammed was one of the numbers crunchers. He was also instrumental in a 2004 ""State of the Dream"" report, that shocked and depressed Black folks with a prediction that Black parity in wealth with whites could not be achieved until the year 2099. This year's study projects it will take almost a century and a half longer just for Black people to reach 2016 white wealth levels. 
A 2010 study out of Brandeis University issued the most honest assessment of long term Black economic prospects in the USA, concluding that African Americans will NEVER gain wealth parity with Euro-Americans.
Parity = $1 Million Per Black Household
The numbers speak eloquently, and irrefutably. Unless this system is dismantled, root and branch, including a fundamental redistribution of wealth, Blacks will fall farther and farther behind whites -- and will be left in the dust by Latinos, as well. Dedrick Asante Muhammed and his colleagues have some suggestions for federal policy changes that might have some very marginal impact on the wealth gap – but not enough to make any real difference. The math is too formidable. To close the wealth gap between white and Black households within a reasonable amount of time – say, by the year 2043, when whites become a minority – the country would have to inject an extra one million dollars into each of the currently existing 16 million Black households, for a total cost of $16 trillion. That's just a little bit less than the entire Gross Domestic Product of the United States, which is about $18 trillion dollars. If the United States wanted to bridge the wealth gap in 27 installments between now and the year 2043, they'd have to pump $600 billion extra a year into Black families' pockets – which happens to be roughly the price tag of the annual U.S. military budget. So, Uncle Sam would have to give up his guns to pay Black folks a fraction of what is owed us. Sounds like a good deal to me – but I don't think Washington will go for it.

104037195986_10154360135955987,"NAACP and Movement for Black Lives Call for Moratorium on Charter Schools
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""School privatization 'strips Black people of the right to self¬determine the kind of education their children receive,' said the coalition.""
As the Obama administration heads into the sunset, its devastating policy of public school privatization through charters has met fierce resistance from two distinct political currents in Black America. The NAACP, at its annual convention last month, adopted a resolution calling for a halt to the spread of privately-owned charter schools. The NAACP has long been critical of charters, but the language of this year's resolution was the strongest, yet, charging that charters contribute to an increase in school segregation and are as destructive to poor communities as predatory lending practices by banks. The civil rights group demanded an end to tax breaks and other advantages for charters and reaffirmed its support for high quality, free public education for all children. The privately appointed boards of charter schools, said the NAACP, ""do not represent the public yet make decisions about how public funds are spent.""
About a week later, the Movement for Black Lives, representing more than 50 organizations, unveiled its platform on a broad range of issues, including a demand for community control of schools and for a cut-off of federal aid to school districts that are not run by elected school boards. School privatization ""strips Black people of the right to self¬determine the kind of education their children receive,"" said the coalition, charging ""this systematic attack"" is ""bankrolled by billionaire philanthropists such as Bill and Melinda Gates, the Walton Family, and Eli and Edythe Broad, and aided by the departments of Education at the federal, state, and local level.""
Cops Out of Schools
The Movement for Black Lives called for and end to Teach for America, President Obama's favorite tool for displacing veteran educators; a moratorium on all suspensions of students; a shutdown of all juvenile detention centers; and removal of police from the schools. The coalition vowed to ""build an international movement of people of African descent to force nations to ratify and recognize education as a human right, and to end privatization."" The coalition specifically called for an end to President Obama's signature program, Race to the Top, which coerces states to increase charter schools or lose billions in federal education funding.
The NAACP, which most often acts as a virtual annex of the Democratic Party, and the Movement for Black Lives, which has righteously refused to endorse any party or political candidate, are both on the same page when it comes to charter schools. Indeed, the NAACP resolution cites the work of the grassroots organization Journey for Justice, an alliance of community, youth, and parent-led organizations in 21 cities across the country, which also worked on the Movement for Black Lives platform on charter schools. The convergence on this issue between two very different Black political tendencies shows that there is a growing, principled consensus in Black America on the need for democracy in public education, through community control of schools. The struggle for Black self-determination is inseparable from defense of public education.

Voters Have Choices Outside the Duopoly
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are both ""evil"" people, but U.S. voters do have choices this election season, said South Carolina activist and author Kevin Alexander Gray. ""It's good that people are running on various third parties, to give Americans a little bit of education,"" as opposed to watching them make one or the other bad choice,"" said Gray, author of Waiting on Lighting to Strike. ""One of the good things about Barack Obama leaving office, particularly for Black people, is that perhaps they'll pick up their signs, pick up their feet, and follow behind the youth that are out here in the streets challenging the system.""
Low Wage Workers to Converge on Richmond
The U.S. labor movement made an historic error in the post-World War Two era in failing to commit sufficient resources to organizing in the heavily Black South. But activists in the current movement to unionize low-paid workers and raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour vow not to repeat that mistake. ""We will highlight that low wages and racial inequality is not only hurting Black and brown people, it's hurting the working poor white people, as well,"" said Terrance Wise, a leader of Fight for 15, which will hold a national conference of low-wage workers in Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy, August 12 and 13. ""Until we can build our movement and bring all workers together to demand economic justice and racial equality, we won't gain any ground,"" said Wise, a Burger King employee from Kansas City.
Russell ""Maroon"" Shoatz Wins Solitary Confinement Settlement
Pennsylvania prison officials have agreed to pay a monetary settlement to political prisoner Russell ""Maroon"" Shoatz, and to never again place the former Black Panther in solitary confinement, where he spent 22 of the past 44 years. His daughter, Theresa Shoatz, is ""elated because it opens the door to other prisoners who are still in solitary confinement in Pennsylvania."" The legal action was spearheaded by the Pittsburg-based Abolitionist Law Center, with virtually no assistance from Black elected officials. ""Our state representatives are useless,"" said Ms. Shoatz.
Afro-Colombian Rights Recognized in Peace Talks
FARC guerillas and the government of Colombia have agreed in principle to ""make sure the rights and interests of Afro-descended and indigenous peoples will be respected"" in the resolution of the South American country's two generations-long civil war, said Charo Mina-Rojas, of the National Afro-Colombian Peace Council. Representatives of the Colombian government and demobilizing guerillas agreed to include such assurances in the peace document being hammered out at negotiations in Havana, Cuba. However, Mina-Rojas said some elements of FARC have not agreed to lay down their arms and ""do not fully recognize"" Afro-Colombians' collective land rights.

104037195986_10154341092135987,"Coalition Declares Black Self-Determination Back on the Agenda
A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The Coalition 'does not believe that our future should be in the hands of any institution that does not have its origins within our own community and has not been forged through the struggles of our people.'""
There have always been two main political imperatives in Black America. One has sought ""representation"" at all levels within the surrounding, hostile, white supremacist society, and celebrates the elevation of individual Blacks to high social, political and economic status. As a practical matter, under this kind of politics, the condition of the Black masses is secondary -- yet, the great bulk of Black people are expected to follow the political direction of the upwardly mobile minority. This ""representationalist"" Black politics makes no transformative demands on the United States, and is quite satisfied if there is a steady growth in the number of Black faces in high places. 
The other main political tendency in Black America seeks self-determination: independent political, economic and social power for Black people as a group. Those that seek self-determination contend that Black people have the right to determine their own destiny and are certainly not answerable to a white society that has enslaved, oppressed and reviled them. 
Throughout Black people's history in the U.S., these two political tendencies have maintained an uneasy coexistence, even simultaneously inhabiting the same individual Black brain. However, with the fall of legal U.S. apartheid in the mid-Sixties and the crushing of Black self-determinationist forces by the U.S. State a few years later, a Black Misleadership Class emerged that was concerned solely with its own narrow interests -- with putting their own selfish faces into high places. This grasping and venal political class collaborated with the U.S. State to impose a mass Black incarceration regime -- what Michelle Alexander calls the New Jim Crow -- and ushered in a two-generation-long era of Black social disintegration, economic retrogression and political confusion. 
Today, however, the Black imperative to self-determination is in ascendance. Especially in the last several years, Black people have rediscovered and revived the Black Radical Tradition, with self-determination at the core. The emerging movement that goes under the heading of Black Lives Matter is largely animated by the drive for Black self-determination, albeit commingled with notions of representationalism. Both tendencies find expression in the Movement for Black Lives newly released demands.
19 Points
The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations, founded in 2009, has always put Black self-determination first, and has now codified this principle in a 19 point National Black Political Agenda for Self-Determination, to be offered ""for discussion and adoption"" by Black people in a process that begins at a national conference in Philadelphia, August 13 and 14. The 19 points cover the broadest range of Black political concerns, from Black Community Control of Police, ending mass Black incarceration, freedom for political prisoners; to demands concerning Black women and families, gentrification, reparations, self-defense, nationalizing the banks, the right to housing, heath care, education, and universal enfranchisement; the necessity for socialist democracy, the defeat of U.S. imperialism and a payback of the Western debt to Africa, freedom for Palestine, and saving the Earth's environment from the capitalist system that is destroying it. 
Each and every of the 19 points is formulated through the prism of Black self-determination. As the Black Is Back Coalition states in its Declaration on the need for a National Black Political Agenda for Self-Determination, the Coalition ""does not believe that our future should be in the hands of any institution that does not have its origins within our own community and has not been forged through the struggles of our people.""
The August 13th and 14th conference in Philadelphia will set the stage of discussions of the Agenda for Self Determination in cities across the country, culminating in a conference in Washington, DC, following the Black Is Back Coalition's traditional rally and march on the White House, in November. Black is Back, and so is Black self-determination, because there can be no democracy without it.

104037195986_10154321127850987,"In Hillary's Service, Ben Jealous Slimes Stein 
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by BAR executive editor Glen Ford
""Jealous flaunted his utter subservience to the Democratic Party.""
Ben Jealous looked so happy to be on the prime time stage at the Democratic National Convention, Monday night – thrilled to be endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. Jealous got to the convention as one of Bernie Sanders' high profile Black supporters, a position he took to ensure that the Black Misleadership Class was represented everywhere within the Democratic Party – including its insurgent wing. The NAACP, which Jealous led for four years, is a virtual annex of the Democratic Party. But, since Jealous was no longer president of the organization, it was safe for him to temporarily join the Sanders camp, with confidence that Bernie would at some point capitulate, and they could all be welcomed back into the bosom of corporate power, personified by Hillary Clinton. 
You could see the utter joy in Jealous' face, like he was coming in from the cold. One of his next stops was the studios of Democracy Now! where he flaunted his utter subservience to the Democratic Party in a debate with the Green Party's presumed presidential candidate, Jill Stein. Jealous sneered at the very idea of challenging the Democrats at the presidential level. ""We cannot afford to end up with having an Iraq War because we narrowly lose the White House...as we did with Bush,"" said Jealous, repeating the old canard that Ralph Nader threw the 2000 election to the Republicans, and ignoring the fact that Hillary Clinton supported Bush's war in Iraq – and that Clinton and Barack Obama have since set the whole of the Middle East and much of Africa on fire. Jealous said his mission is to keep the ""madman"" and ""neo-fascist"" Donald Trump, out of the White House, to which Jill Stein replied: ""Hillary Clinton's finger on the button is as dangerous as Donald Trump. And it's Barack Obama himself who initiated the new nuclear arms race, spending a trillion dollars.""
Jealous the Parrot
Ben Jealous could muster no substantive response to Stein on issues of war and peace, or on domestic issues, either. The Black Misleadership Class is not concerned with policy, but with their own position in the Democratic Party structure, which is their doorway to Wall Street and the ruling class. Jealous shamelessly parroted the insane line that Hillary Clinton is ""a fierce advocate for women and for children"" when, as Jill Stein reminded him, Bill and Hillary Clinton destroyed the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program – welfare, as we knew it. Jealous said he was ""rooted in a Black community that's been devastated"" by mass incarceration – as if Bill and Hillary were not the architects of the biggest surge in Black imprisonment in history. 
Ben Jealous doesn't know what a fascist is, and could care less; he only knows that his job is to keep Black people inside Hillary Clinton's big corporate tent. He slanders leftists like Jill Stein as giving aid and comfort to Donald Trump, but makes a career of delivering Black people into the clutches of the worst mass murderers and mass incarcerators the Democratic Party has to offer. What is truly anathema to Ben Jealous and his ilk is a reemergence of a Black independent politics that would likely be more radical and more socialist than Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein – and would put Black Misleaders like him out of business.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The Clinton's goal was to transform Haiti into the sweatshop of the Caribbean.""
Hillary Clinton and her huckster husband, Slick Willie, seem to specialize in bringing harm to Black people. The public record, stretching back many decades, proves they are Class A racists who have destroyed countless Blacks lives in the service of corporate interests and their own private greed. The Clintons' crimes against the people of Haiti are but one chapter in the blood-soaked saga of the most vile American couple ever to stride the global stage.
The U.S. State Department, still emitting the stink of Hillary Clinton's stewardship in Barack Obama's first term, last week announced it would withdraw financial support for new presidential elections planned for Haiti, this October. That's just fine with most Haitians, who know that, when the U.S. finances Haitian elections, it gets what it pays for: a government of gangsters in service to multinational corporations and a local elite that fears and despises the poor majority. 
A broad consensus of Haiti's political spectrum agreed to re-start the election process from scratch, and to discard the results of last year's rigged elections that would have kept the political faction headed by former President Michel ""Sweet Mickey"" Martelly in power. Martelly, a profane nightclub singer and close associate of terrorists and drug lords, became president in 2011 through a rigged election engineered by U.S. Secretary of State Clinton. Martelly spent much of his term ruling by decree, ruthlessly suppressing the parties of Haiti's poor majority, allowing gold mining companies and other foreign extraction industries to illegally take over vast stretches of countryside; and seizing coastal properties and islands for the benefit of multinational tourism corporations.  American companies and NGOs got the lion's share of the billions raised to rebuild the country after the devastating 2010 earthquake, with Martelly's gangster class skimming off the crumbs. 
Promoting the Advantages of Poverty
The Clinton's goal was to transform Haiti into the sweatshop of the Caribbean by keeping Haitian labor dirt-cheap at places like the Clinton Foundation's Caracol industrial park. Bill Clinton preached that Haiti's poverty provided it with a competitive advantage; so, the Clintons tried their best to keep Haiti as poor as possible. Hillary Clinton bullied Haiti and rigged its elections through the State Department, and former president Bill Clinton lorded it over the country as special United Nations Envoy, while the Clinton Foundation spent $36 million doing who knows what, and the Clinton Global Initiative managed as much as $500 million in aid money designated for Haiti. Meanwhile, 7,000 Haitians died from a cholera epidemic brought into the country by a UN occupation force that reduced Haiti to an international ""protectorate"" – protected, that is, from the democratic aspirations of the Haitian people, themselves. 
As Martelly's term drew to close last year, his government stole two more elections with the approval of the United States, which paid for the crime and told Haiti to accept the outcomes. But the Haitians said, keep your money, and are going ahead with new elections in October. This should mark an end to the infinitely corrupt Clinton era in Haiti – except that the Clintons will likely be on their way back to the White House in November, positioning them to pollute the whole planet with their noxious, lethal sleaze and criminality.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Sanders' job is to shepherd his flock into a little leftwing corner of Hillary's Big Tent, right next to the latrine and alongside her loyal Black Democrats.""
Bernie Sanders this Tuesday consummated his sheepdog agreement with the Democratic Party, delivering a formal endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president.  The capitulation script that Sanders read in New Hampshire, with the cackling Banshee of War at his side, could have been written back in the spring of last year, when he formally threw his hat into the race. From the very start, Sanders was firm in his allegiance to the Democratic wing of the corporate duopoly, and any indications to the contrary were purely products of his supporters wishful imaginations. 
Bernie Sanders did not lie to his followers; they deceived themselves, just as most of them – the ones that were old enough – had fooled themselves into believing that Barack Obama was a peace candidate and a political progressive back in 2008, although Obama's actual record and policy pronouncements showed him clearly to be a corporate imperialist warmonger – a political twin of his principal primary election opponent, Hillary Clinton and her philandering, huckster husband.
Back then, phony leftists like Bill Fletcher and Tom Hayden swore on their mothers' honor that Obama's campaign was really a people's movement, a prelude to revolution – as if the Democrats, a militarist corporate political party, could give birth to anti-corporate, anti-militarist people's revolution. 
Real Fascist vs. Trump Cartoon Version
Bernie Sanders threw around the word ""revolution"" quite a bit. He was still using it in his surrender speech on Tuesday, assuring his flock that the revolution would continue as he marched arm in arm with the most dangerous person in the world, today – far more dangerous than Donald Trump, who will be buried in a landslide of historical proportions in November by a multi-billion dollar mountain of campaign contributions from Hillary Clinton's Democratic and Republican friends on Wall Street. Sanders' job is to shepherd his flock into a little leftwing corner of Hillary's Big Tent, right next to the latrine and alongside her loyal Black Democrats, who are so meek in the presence of power that they won't even complain about the smell. 
In his kow-tow to the Queen of Chaos, Sanders put words in Clinton's mouth that she never really said, and that would be lies if she did say them. Hillary ""feels"" this, Hillary ""believes"" that – it was as if he could read Hillary's mind.  Hillary ""knows,"" said Sanders, ""that something is very wrong when the very rich become richer while many others are working longer hours for lower wages."" Maybe she does know that, but she has no intention to do anything about it – just as she had no intention of allowing the Democratic Party platform to oppose TPP, although she claims she's against it. As for those compromises Clinton did make on the platform: she was lying. The Clintons have an infinite capacity for lying, and now they've got Bernie Sanders lying for them, too. 
If only 5 percent of Bernie Sanders' 13 million voters formed or joined a party of the 99 percent – let's say, the Green Party – that party would have nearly twice as many members as the British Labor Party. which would be one helluva start. Or, they can crawl along with Bernie into Hillary's stinking Big Tent, where the real fascists live – the ones with actual experience in regime change, nuclear brinksmanship and mass Black incarceration.

Freedom Rider: Republicans Reject Trump

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""There's no way the FBI was going to keep the rulers of the United States from getting the president they want.""
Hillary Clinton has escaped indictment – as almost universally expected – for commingling her email communications as secretary of state with her personal business, including the global money laundering, bribery and extortion racket called the Clinton Foundation. The Clintons are capable of infinite corruption. That's why they're in politics: to protect the criminal enterprises of the truly rich people they serve, and to become rich, themselves. That is the nature of the system – and the system works; it provides impunity to the powerful.
FBI Director James Comey essentially admitted as much when he acknowledged that there was ""evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information."" A reasonable person in Clinton's position ""should have known"" that what she was doing was violating the law. But, he said, the FBI's ""judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case."" The public knows perfectly well that what Comey really means is that there's no way he was going to keep the rulers of the United States from getting the president they want.
So, Hillary gets off, as did the warlord General David Petraeus and other insiders who were not fully prosecuted for clearly breaking the law. Yet, President Obama has shattered all historical records in treating whistleblowers as spies. Obama pushed for and got the power to detain people indefinitely without trial or charge, but is so tolerant of systemic criminality among Wall Street bankers that his own attorney general had to briefly admit that the Lords of Capital are ""too big to jail."" So, on the one hand, the fundamental right to due process under the law has ceased to exist – yet, for the rich impunity has become all but absolute.
""People are just plain repulsed by Hillary Clinton.""
The rulers are caught in a crisis of legitimacy. Obscenely concentrated wealth has turned U.S. society into a Constitution-free zone for the wealthy, who behave as if they are a separate species. They have exhausted the tolerance even of white Americans, descendants of Europeans who came here hoping to become rich, but now despair of keeping their heads above water and are growing to despise the 1%. 
Black folks are waking up – angry! – after two generations of relative quietude, pushing back against a police state that is coddled by Congress, upheld by the Supreme Court, and unchallenged by the executive branch. The system is leaking legitimacy like a sieve. 
Donald Trump is seen as illegitimate by probably a majority of Americans, but so is Hillary Clinton. In some ways, Clinton is even more revolting. Most people that hate Trump can point to one or more of his specific policies or statements. However, people are just plain repulsed by Hillary Clinton. If pressed on why find her so distasteful, folks say she is dishonest, not to be trusted – but usually offer no particulars. What they really feel, is that she is corrupt to the bone; that she personifies the Lie that the top of society tells to the bottom. 
The crisis of legitimacy becomes acute when enough people say, ""Who are you to hold power over me?""

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""They like the house that slavery and genocide built, and where global capitalism now rules.""
We can be sure that the British exit from the European Union represents a profound crisis for the global capitalist order. We know this because the Lords of Capital and their political minions and media all over the world are in panic over Brexit. The capitalist order is built on five centuries of European plunder, enslavement, and extermination of the rest of humanity. Blood oozes from every edifice of the European Union – and yet, the victims, and the descendants of the victims of this horrific and ongoing capitalist carnage, often behave as if they have some kind of stake in keeping the old order intact. Like Malcolm X's house Negroes, their first instinct when they see the master's house on fire, is to put the fire out. If the master gets sick, they start sneezing. And, when the referendum went against Britain staying in the European Union, house Negroes of all colors on both sides of the Atlantic acted like their own worlds were coming to end.
On Comedy Central's Daily Show, this week, host Trevor Noah interviewed Cynthia Erivo, who plays Celie in the Broadway production of ""The Color Purple."" Noah lampooned those Brits that voted to leave the EU as a bunch of Donald Trumps with Cockney accents. He said nothing about the EU's pro-corporate, pro-banker austerity policies – maybe because there's nothing funny about those policies, or maybe because he works for a rich corporation. Noah drew Ms. Erivo into the Brexit discussion. She was born in London to parents who emigrated from Nigeria. She explained her opposition to Brexit, saying, ""If my mom didn't get to the UK, I probably wouldn't be here right now, on that stage on Broadway."" 
""By colonizing Nigeria, the Brits saved her from being born an African.""
Cynthia Erivo is grateful that her West African parents were allowed into Britain, so that she could be born in London and pursue a successful career. Her parents were permitted to settle in Britain because Nigeria was a British colony, and later became part of the British Commonwealth. It actually had nothing to do with the European Union. By Cynthia Erivo's logic, it was a good thing that Britain invaded, plundered, enslaved, and stole her parent's homeland. By colonizing Nigeria, the Brits saved her from being born an African. The millions who died in the British conquest of Nigeria, and in the Middle Passage to the America's, or on the plantations of Virginia or Jamaica, or in forced labor to the British in Nigeria, or who die today in the oil soaked wasteland of the Niger River Delta  – all of this past and present suffering and human degradation is balanced out by the fact that a daughter of Nigeria gets to star in a Broadway show. This super-exploitation of Africa made Britain and France and Spain and Belgium and the Netherlands and other members of today's European Union rich – but Cynthia Erivo and Trevor Noah, the South African, come to the defense of the European Union.
They like the house that slavery and genocide built, and where global capitalism now rules. They fear anything that might create disorder in the House of Europe, just as their counterparts in Black America fear anything that might disturb the tranquility of the U.S. ruling class and its institutions. The House Negroes are truly international, always ready to put out fires in their masters many houses around the globe.

104037195986_10154212749125987,"4 out of 5 Prisoners Would Have to be Released to Reduce U.S. Incarceration to 1972 Levels
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
""Mass Black incarceration knows no bounds in the United States of America.""
A new report shows that New Jersey has the nation's highest racial disparity in incarceration rates, with Blacks in the state 12 times more likely to go to prison than whites. The report is titled, The Color of Justice: Racial and Ethnic Disparity in State Prisons, compiled by The Sentencing Project, a Washington-based prison reform group. Right behind New Jersey in racially disparate imprisonment are Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Vermont – all states with relatively small Black populations, but where African Americans are 10 times as likely to be incarcerated than whites. Mass Black incarceration knows no bounds in the United States of America, the world champion of incarceration, with 2.3 million men and women behind bars. 
Some states are worse than others, but all of them are much worse for Black people than for whites. Blacks don't make up a majority of any state in the country, but they are the majority of the prison population in 12 states: Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.
In terms of the proportion of the Black male population that is incarcerated at any given time, the prize goes to Oklahoma, where 1 out of every 15 Black men, age 18 or older, is currently living behind bars. In 11 other states, 1 out of every 20 Black males has been snatched from his communities.
""Don't expect any late term prisoner release surprises from Barack Obama.""
New Jersey stands out for high rates of racial disparity in incarceration and for having a Black majority in the prison system, but in recent years its one of three states that have substantially reduced their prison populations. New York and California have also scaled down their gulags. According to The Sentencing Project, the key to shrinking the prison population lies in the intake valves of a criminal justice system that arrests far too many people, especially Black people, and then locks them up for way too long. Project executive director Marc Mauer told Black Agenda Report that President Obama and his successors should consider clemency for whole categories of prisoners, similar to President Gerald Ford's amnesty for draft resisters back in 1974. But, don't expect any late term prisoner release surprises from Barack Obama, who went to court to keep about 5,000 federal crack cocaine prisoners behind bars, even after the racist legislation under which they were convicted was repealed and replaced.
Without fundamental changes at every stage of the criminal justice process, Black Americans will continue to make up something approaching 1 out of every 8 prison inmates in the world. Indeed, accounting for growth in U.S. population, by my calculations the nation's jailers and prison wardens would have to set 4 out of every 5 of their prisoners free just to get incarceration rates down to the levels of 1972, when the effects of the national mass Black incarceration regime were just starting to be felt. Of the 2.3 million current prison inmates, fully 80 percent, totaling 1,850,000 men and women would have to be let go – and even then, the United States would still be a high incarceration nation. 1972 was one year after the Attica Rebellion – not a great time for Black people in the criminal justice system. If only we had known that, 44 years later, things would be far, far worse.

What Remains Hidden in Rwanda: The Role of Tutsi Civilians in Killing Hutus

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""He fears the government is out to do him harm.""
Rev. Edward Pinkney, the imprisoned community activist from the mostly Black town of Benton Harbor, Michigan, believes his life is in danger. Pinkney is serving a sentence of two and a half to ten years following his conviction by an all-white jury on the flimsiest of charges of tampering with an election recall petition. He told Kenneth Rhoades, a supporter on the outside, that he's not afraid of the inmates, but fears the government is out to do him harm – and that they might get away with it because, in his words, ""they cover everything up"" at Marquette Branch Prison, located on the thinly populated and very, very white Upper Peninsula of Michigan, almost 500 miles from Benton Harbor.
Pinkney, who is 67 years old, has witnessed numerous assaults on inmates by prison guards, and has spent long stretches in isolation. For six months he was deprived of phone and visitation privileges because the authorities believed he was behind a mass inmate food protest – another bogus charge, since inmates at prisons on the Upper Peninsula have been protesting the food since before Pinkney arrived.
This is the second time that Pinkney has been railroaded to prison for trying to bring change to deeply impoverished Benton Harbor through the vote. Back in 2007, after two trials, an all-white jury from the surrounding county convicted him of tampering with a ballot petition. He was sentenced to house arrest, but was then thrown in prison for a year when he quoted Bible verses to the judge – something of a first in American legal history. Ultimately, the conviction was overturned on appeal.
Crushing Voting Rights Activism with SWAT and Prison
Rev. Pinkney's lawyers believe his current conviction on similar bogus charges will ultimately also be reversed – but that could take years, and anything can happen to a political activist in the American prison gulag.
Mary Neal, who calls Rev. Pinkney her ""online minister,"" believes the people of Flint, Michigan, would have responded to the poisoning of their water sooner if Pinkney hadn't been incarcerated at the time. The Reverend has had more experience than most other activists in dealing with state appointed emergency financial managers like the one that switched the water supply in Flint. Benton Harbor was put under state dictatorship in 2010. Governor Rick Snyder then quickly expanded the emergency financial manager regime to all of the state's heavily Black cities, effectively disenfranchising more than half of Michigan's Black citizens. But, Rev. Pinkney and his Black Autonomy Network Community Organization, or BANCO, pressed on, refusing to accept the loss of their local voting rights, either to the State of Michigan, or at the hands of the giant Whirlpool Corporation, which has ruled Benton Harbor like a plantation for generations. Finally, they sent a SWAT team to arrest Rev. Pinkney at his home in April, 2014, and now he sits in cell in the American equivalent of Siberia, a 67 year old soldier in the African liberation struggle.

McKinney: Duopoly is Imploding, But What Comes Next?
The 2016 election is going to be ""written about and studied for a very long time,"" said six-term former Georgia Democratic Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, the Green Party's 2008 presidential candidate. ""Black voters don't have any stake at all in the continuation of either the Democratic or Republican Parties, as presently constituted,"" said McKinney, who last year earned her doctorate in Leadership and Change. ""The implosion of the duopoly is of great political import to the Black community,"" she said. ""The problem is, however, that we have to be organized in order to have an imprint on the outcome.""
2016 ""Most Consequential"" Election in a Century
""The two-party duopoly is at an end,"" said Dr. Anthony Monteiro, the Dubosian scholar and Black Radical Organizing Committee activist who helped put together a national conference on the Black Radical Tradition, in Philadelphia, in January. Monteiro believes that 2016 will go down as ""the most consequential election, certainly, in 100 years."" Monteiro noted that Donald Trump told Bloomberg News he would turn the Republican Party into a workers party. ""This is huge, said Monteiro. ""He has broken every Republican orthodoxy."" Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, ""is challenging the elite and the power brokers and the moneybags within the Democratic Party, but he has not gone as far as Trump to challenge American hegemony and American empire."" 
Free Rev. Edward Pinkney, Political Prisoner
""The system is rigged and corrupt,"" said Rev. Edward Pinkney, the Benton Harbor, Michigan, community activist serving 30 months to 10 years on bogus election tampering charges that he believes stem from his defiance of the Whirlpool Corporations domination of the mostly Black town. ""We must stand and demand the government serve the interests of the people, and not the corporations,"" said Pinkney, who fears he will be assassinated at the Marquette Branch Prison in the upper peninsula of Michigan. ""The attack on democracy in Benton Harbor and around the country shows that the corporate power structure is determined to crush anyone that stands in its way,"" he said.
Schools Annually Eject Huge Numbers of Black Girls

104037195986_10154163232025987,"Freddie Gray Case Judge Rules it is Unreasonable to Expect Cops to Obey the Law
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""If you're going to go back and charge every police officer whose arrest was determined to be illegal with assault, you're going to indict the entire police force.""
The cops charged in the death of Freddie Gray had another good day in a Baltimore courtroom, on Monday, when one of the six officers was found not guilty of second degree assault, misconduct and reckless endangerment. Officer Edward Nero had opted not to undergo a trial by jury, so the case was decided by a Black circuit court judge, Barry Williams.  The trial of another cop, William Porter, ended in a mistrial back in December when the jury deadlocked on all four counts. If Officer Porter is tried again, it will be after the trials of all the other cops are completed.
But Officer Nero is home free, because Judge Williams ruled that there was ""no evidence that the cop intended for a crime to occur."" Judge Williams was affirming the triple legal standard that exists in American law: one standard for cops, another for civilians in general, and no reliable expectation of justice at all for Black people. 
Officer Nero was one of the cops that arrested Freddie Gray, dragged his limping body to a police transport wagon, and then failed to secure him with a seatbelt. Gray was given a wild ride through the streets of Baltimore, his handcuffed body crashing into the sides and front of the vehicle, fatally severing his spine. 
Lawlessness Begins with the Lawmen
Freddie Gray's only offense was to run away after making eye contact with a police supervisor – which is not a crime in anybody's law book. But, as my colleague Bruce Dixon often says, cops are like hounds, and Black people are treated like rabbits, and when a rabbit runs away from the hounds they will chase it down and tear it apart. 
So, the hounds are on trial in Baltimore.  The prosecution maintains that the cops had no right to arrest and move Freddie Gray – that this amounted to second degree assault on his person. In her closing arguments, deputy state's attorney Janice Bledsoe said ""people get jacked up in the city all the time"" by cops, and such behavior must be punished. But, the judge seemed to think it would be ridiculous to treat every arrest as criminal just because there were no grounds for arrest. Officer Nero's lawyer agreed, saying it didn't make any difference if the cops acted illegally in arresting Freddie Gray. ""Wrong or right isn't the standard,"" said the cop's attorney. ""The standard is, were they so wrong that it was unreasonable?""
So, cops have to be more than just guilty of breaking the law; they must be ""unreasonably"" guilty – whatever that is.
Warren Brown, a defense lawyer who observed the proceedings, said: ""If you're going to go back and charge every police officer whose arrest was determined to be illegal with assault, or every search that's deemed to be absent probable cause, [then] you're going to indict the entire police force.""

104037195986_10154147370495987,"If White People Love Drugs So Much, Why are the Prisons Full of Blacks?
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The way Black people actually behave is not nearly as important as the way the state intervenes in Black people's lives.""
It is now commonly recognized that white people do more drugs than Blacks and Hispanics, but go to jail for it far less often. White kids also smoke and drink more than Black kids, which most people would assume should correlate with youthful rebellion or rowdiness, but it's the Black kids that are expelled from school at far higher rates than those hard smoking, booze-swilling whites. What the numbers are telling us is that the way Black people actually behave is not nearly as important as the way the state intervenes in Black people's lives. Crime statistics do not measure actual crime; they measure arrests and convictions. In that sense, crime statistics are actually measurements of the activities of police, prosecutors and judges; Black people are simply the objects that are being acted upon, by the criminal justice system.
Now, this does not mean that Black folks don't engage in their share of crime; it simply means you can't measure the prevalence of crime or anti-social behavior in the Black community by arrest and conviction statistics, or by expulsions from school. 
Longitudinal studies are valuable sociological tools because they keep track of groups of people over a period of years, or even decades, rather than just presenting a snap-shot of the human subjects. This month, the American Journal of Public Health published the results of a longitudinal study of nearly two thousand young people who passed through the intake facility at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center in Chicago, Illinois, between November, 1995, and June, 1998. Researchers interviewed the juveniles about their substance-use disorders, or SUDS in the jargon of the profession. At intervals, over a period of 12 years, the researchers caught up with their subjects, and debriefed them on their use of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens or PCP, opiates, amphetamines, and other drugs. They found that, not only were the white former juvenile detainees more likely to use drugs as they got older, their use of cocaine was 30 times higher than among the African Americans in the study. Hispanics were 20 times more likely to get coked up than Blacks. And whites were 50 times more likely than Blacks to be abusing opiates. 
Deeply Troubled White Kids, Cruelly Oppressed Black Kids
These are extreme figures, showing a disparity in drug abuse behavior between Blacks and whites so huge, it could not possibly reflect the different ethnic groups' behavior in society at large. White people as a group do not do 30 times more cocaine than Blacks. However, white kids that wind up getting caught by Chicago area police and sent to the juvenile detention center represent the most troubled segment of their age and race. Even white skin privilege could not save them from arrest. They were the most doped up of their young white cohort – and they stayed that way as they got older. Whereas, the Black kids that were passing through the Cook County juvenile detention center were much more ordinary – because picking up Black children and throwing them in jail is quite an ordinary thing for cops to do. 
The study does not shed much light on race and drugs, but it does reveal a lot about race and the criminal justice system.

104037195986_10154117167765987,"Why Obama Silenced bin Laden
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Bin Laden had to die so that al Qaida could live to fight another day for U.S. imperialism in Libya and Syria.""
Five years ago, this week, U.S. Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden, in a fully wired, real-time assassination that was observed, half a world away by President Obama and much of his entourage. It was as if the high commission of the Mafia had gathered to watch the silencing of a witness who might testify to what the whole gang had been up to all these years. The SEALS that carried out the hit, supposedly the most disciplined troops in the U.S. military, made no effort whatsoever to capture bin Laden. Instead, they shot him on sight in the head and then raked his body with at least one hundreds bullets. 
Bin Laden wasn't going to do any talking to anybody; that was the purpose of the mission. The United States government had no interest in learning the real history or capabilities of al Qaida; they already knew every detail. They had been there, with bin Laden, from the very beginning, back in Afghanistan in the late Seventies and early Eighties, when the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Pakistan created the world's first international Islamic jihadist network, with bin Laden at the center. The U.S. and its allies have been manipulating that network like attack dogs, ever since, siccing them on their enemies with one hand and then pretending to wage never ending war against the jihadists, with the other. It's been one hell of a scam.
A Symbolic Decapitation, to Deflect Attention from a Huge Mobilization
There was an urgent need to take out bin Laden in May of 2011. The United States and its European and royal Arab allies were in the midst of another Shock and Awe offensive to bring down the secular governments of Libya and Syria, and they needed all the jihadist foot soldiers they could get. The trick was to pretend that the jihadists in Libya and Syria were really just freedom-loving political dissidents and patriotic ""moderates"" who were oppressed by their governments and, therefore, deserving of U.S. arms, financing, and air support. To pull that one off, Washington had to create the impression that al Qaida, the international jihadist network, had been drastically weakened and marginalized, so that Westerners would not be terrified watching Islamic fighters on television running around cutting off heads and shouting ""God is Great."" Al Qaida had to be symbolically decapitated, through the killing of bin Laden, so that the U.S. could trick its own citizens, if not the world, into believing that the Arab fighters that Washington was backing were the good guys, even though they behaved just like al Qaida.
In short, bin Laden had to die so that al Qaida could live to fight another day for U.S. imperialism in Libya and Syria. The U.S. is still arming and protecting al Qaida, whose Syrian affiliate, al Nusra, is the main force holding the so-called ""rebel"" lines in Aleppo, Syria's largest city. The U.S. would be protecting the al Qaida off-shoot ISIS, as well, if ISIS had not decided to fight its own war, for its own reasons. Even so, the U.S. did not mount serious attacks against ISIS in Syria until the Russians intervened, which showed the whole world that Washington had been collaborating with the terrorists, all along – something that we might have learned of in great detail, if Osama bin Laden had been captured and put on trial.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The U.S. war on terror is probably the greatest lie of the 21st century, and a big part of the 20th century, too.""
President Obama continues to play his three card monte game in Syria, pretending to wage an all-out war against ISIS, while at the same time helping al-Nusra, al-Qaida's terrorist army in Syria, blend in with the other jihadists armed and financed by the United States and its allies. With Russian help, the Syrian Army may soon be in position to march against the ISIS capital, in Raqqah, and to drive al-Qaida from the country's second largest city, Aleppo. If that happens, it would signal the final unraveling of a nearly four decades-long U.S. policy of using fundamentalist Islamic jihadists as foot soldiers for U.S. imperialism, in partnership with Saudi Arabia. That's what is driving the Saudi monarchy crazy, because, if the jihadists are defeated in Syria, they are certain to turn on their Saudi paymasters and the other infinitely corrupt monarchies in the Persian Gulf. What goes around, eventually comes around.
And, that's why President Obama is sending 250 more Special Forces troops into Syria, supposedly to train more of those phantom ""moderate"" rebels that the Pentagon last year admitted do not exist. The real number of U.S. troops in Syria and Iraq is certainly much higher than the U.S. is admitting. These U.S. soldiers are attempting to rearm and unite all of the smaller terrorist groups that are integrated with al-Qaida – that is, everyone except ISIS. 
The Russians aren't fooled one bit by Obama's terrorist shell game. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has resisted U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's proposals to carve Syria up into so-called ""zones of interest,"" a phony kind of cease-fire that would prevent the Syrian government from taking back its national territory. Lavrov is telling the U.S. that any so-called rebels that are caught fighting alongside al-Qaida will be killed, just like al-Qaida, and that the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria is not subject to negotiation. 
""The U.S. presence in Syria is totally illegal.""
The Russians and the Syrian government not only have international law firmly on their side, but also the relevant United Nations Security Council resolution, which calls on the entire world to fight against both ISIS and al-Qaida's Nusra Front. The U.S. voted for the resolution, and President Obama has repeatedly stated that Washington respects Syria's national sovereignty. Obama is lying, of course – but then, the U.S. war on terror is probably the greatest lie of the 21st century, and a big part of the 20th century, too. 
The U.S. presence in Syria is totally illegal – which is why Obama has to cloak it in terms of American self-defense against ISIS, despite the fact that ISIS grew by leaps and bounds until the Russians intervened and forced the Americans to pretend to wage war against it. The U.S. troops' main job is to arm the various brands of al-Qaida fighters with heavy weapons, and to act as a ""trip wire,"" daring the Russians to bomb areas of the country where American troops are active. In other words, he is prepared to go to war with Russia to defend the terrorist armies he has unleashed on Syria.
Obama will end his term in office as the protector-in-chief of al-Qaida. What a legacy for the First Black President.

104037195986_10154087091040987,"There's Only One Cure for Chicago Police Lawlessness: Black Community Control
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
 ""Democracy demands that ""the people must be empowered to hold the police accountable for their crimes and misconduct.""
The absolute intransigence of the U.S. mass incarceration regime is most dramatically on display in Chicago, where Mayor Rahm Emanuel's own special investigative task force has concluded that the ""police have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color."" The report backs up that conclusion with a now-familiar recitation of statistics that show, by the numbers, the raw nature of the police as an occupying army that perceives that its mission is to stop, humiliate, frame, physically abuse, torture and kill Black and brown people. Seventy-four percent of the 404 people shot by the Chicago police last year were Black. Seventy-two percent of those stopped on the street but who were not arrested, were Black. Three quarters of those singled out for tasering were Black. And, the bulk of the remainder were Latino. 
The task force was Mayor Emanuel's response to demonstrations in protest of a massive cover-up of the police killing of Laquan McDonald, whose death in a hail of 16 bullets was caught on video that was hidden from public view for more than a year. Since then, the killer cops have been gunning down Black folks like clockwork, including last week's shooting of 16 year-old Pierre Loury after he ran away from a police stop. Witnesses say the cops high-fived each other over the dead boy's body.
""The mayor thinks he can hide behind Eddie Johnson's Black face – but those days are over.""
Mayor Emanuel was forced to fire his police superintendent in the wake of the Laquan McDonald cover-up. Last week he passed over three candidates recommended by a police oversight board, to pick Eddie Johnson, a Black 28-year veteran of the force, as the new superintendent. Emanuel made it clear that Eddie Johnson's first job is to restore the ""morale"" of his fellow officers. ""He's well-respected within the department among the rank-and-file officers,"" said Emanuel, as if the main task is to keep the cops happy – instead of confronting the fact that they ""have no regard for the sanctity"" of Black lives. The mayor thinks he can hide behind Eddie Johnson's Black face – but those days are over. Johnson's record of service to the Chicago Police Department is a badge of shame, not honor. He served as chief of patrol, commanding 8,000 of the very same officers that have compiled an unbroken record of lawlessness and contempt for civilian authority. Eddie Johnson would not have climbed so high in such a department if he were not, himself, a protector and champion of killer cops.
The young people that forced the issue of police terror to the forefront vow that they won't settle for anything less than community control of police. They say democracy demands that ""the people must be empowered to hold the police accountable for their crimes and misconduct,"" the power to tell the police how they want their communities to be made safe and secure. As Frank Chapman, Field Organizer for the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression wrote on the organization's Facebook page, ""Community control of the police is not a utopian dream, it is what we are fighting for now in this present reality.""
The present reality, in Chicago and throughout the United States, is that the police are an occupation army in the Black community. If there is to be peace, that army must be dismantled and disbanded.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Officers of a secret police cyber-unit have been taking pictures of activists, collecting names, and then matching them with postings on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media.""
The U.S. corporate media would have you believe that the movement that goes under the heading of Black Lives Matter has already gained substantial acceptance in the ruling circles of the United States, especially on the Democratic side of the electoral duopoly; that progress is evident in Hillary Clinton's acceptance of the fact of her own white privilege, and the Democratic National Committee's endorsement of the Black Lives Matter Network's founders by name; and that the Movement is now transitioning into the ""mainstream"" with twiterist DeRay McKesson's campaign for mayor of Baltimore. 
The reality is that the U.S. National Security and Mass Black Incarcerate State is intent on breaking the back of the movement through the usual means: police repression, reinforced by more recent innovations in the technology of political control. And, just as with the Occupy Movement of a few years ago, the task of containing and neutralizing the Movement will fall to Democratic administrations in the nation's big cities. Like Los Angeles.
LA is the center of the criminal in-justice system's counter-offensive. A batch of six Black Lives Matter protesters face possible retrial this month, after a jury failed to convict them on misdemeanor charges for barricading an LA highway in November of 2014. The trial of three more protesters is under way for taking part in a 1,000-person strong demonstration in which a commuter train was stopped, in April of 2015. Mayor Eric Garcetti and his City Attorneys seem determined to take down the movement's best cadres, selectively prosecuting only 20 of the 330 people arrested in the 2014 protests – all of them active members of Black Lives Matter. 
""Just as with the Occupy Movement of a few years ago, the task of containing and neutralizing the Movement will fall to Democratic administrations in the nation's big cities.""
In an interview on Democracy Now! Black Lives Matter lawyer Nana Gyamfi said officers of a secret police cyber-unit have been taking pictures of activists, collecting names, and then matching them with postings on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media. Clearly, the cops are forming maps of activist social networks and gathering evidence for conspiracy charges in the future. According to Gyamfi, letters on LAPD and state Department of Justice stationary have been sent to activists' workplaces, informing their bosses that they have been arrested for ""felony conspiracy"" to commit a crime.
Sounds like COINTELPRO, the FBI's counter-intelligence program to disrupt and neutralize radical organizations, two generations ago. COINTELPRO also coexisted with Democratic Party attempts to co-opt Black movement leadership. At the same time that Dr. Martin Luther King was making visits to the White House, the Kennedy brothers and, later, President Lyndon Johnson were authorizing the FBI to spy on his activities. They sent letters urging King to kill himself – and we all know how that turned out. 
Los Angeles was the city where SWAT teams were first deployed, in 1969, against the headquarters of the Black Panther Party. It looks like LA will be the point of the spear for political police repression in the 21st century.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Former Officer Liang's supporters argued that he would not have faced charges at all, if he had been white.""
Last week, the District Attorney for Brooklyn, New York, recommended that the cop who was convicted in the death of Akai Gurley not spend a single day in prison, but, instead, serve five years probation, six months on home confinement, and do 500 hours of community service. The cop's lawyer called the DA's decision ""courageous."" Members of the city's Chinese American community had packed the trial, demanding that former officer Peter Liang be acquitted of negligent manslaughter charges for shooting Gurley as the unarmed 28 year-old father walked in the darkened stairwell of a public housing apartment building with his girlfriend. Liang's supporters argued that he would not have faced charges at all, if he had been white. 
District Attorney Ken Thompson, a Democrat, the son of a cop, and the first Black to be elected as top prosecutor for Brooklyn, justified his recommendation of leniency, saying there was ""no evidence"" that Liang intended to kill Akai Gurley, and that Liang was not a danger to the community – despite the fact that he had already killed a law abiding member of the community.
Akai Gurley's family was outraged. They said District Attorney Thompson's recommendation ""sends the message that police officers who kill people should not face serious consequences."" At least some of the jurors that convicted the cop agreed. One asked, ""What was the point of prosecuting him? If something is wrong, you shouldn't get a slap on the wrist."" Another juror said the DA's call for leniency was ""ridiculous,"" and confided to the Daily News that his own father had spent seven years in prison for accidentally shooting a friend.
However, the only Black person on the jury, a 69 year-old man, said the prosecutor was only ""doing his job."" 
""Impunity for police is built into the system.""
The person who will have the final say in the case is Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun, who is scheduled to sentence Liang on April 14. Before he was appointed to the court, Chun, a Korean American, was a prosecutor. 
The Brooklyn DA's decision means that, even when a police officer is convicted of criminally negligent homicide in the death of an unarmed and totally non-threatening Black man, in a trial in which the chief prosecutor is Black, the chances of meaningful punishment are slim, because impunity for police is built into the system. No matter the weight of the evidence, Black lives don't really matter in the U.S. criminal justice system. So inconsequential was the life of Akai Gurley, that Chinese Americans believed that Officer Liang was entitled to the same impunity – the same free pass – in the death of a Black man, as a white cop could expect to get. 
Ken Thompson, the Black prosecutor, clearly feels the same way. He is a career Democratic politician whose allegiance is to the party and the system that appointed him, not to Black people, and certainly not to any notions of justice. His job, as he saw it, was to prevent the jury from dispensing justice, to turn loose a killer cop – because he is a killer prosecutor and, as Akai Gurley's supporters said throughout the trial, ""The whole damn system is guilty as hell.""

104037195986_10154004204790987,"Raul Castro Should Ask Obama: What About U.S. Political Prisoners?
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The United States is holding scores of political prisoners, many of them captured in the 1960s and 70s.""
President Obama knew it was impolitic to play his hypocritical human rights game while in the presence of Cuban President Raul Castro, in Havana, this week. So Obama had one of his kiss-up White House reporters do the sneak attack for him. CNN's Jim Acosta, the son of a Cuban exile, asked President Castro why his country kept political prisoners. Castro replied, ""What political prisoners?"" and asked Acosta to provide a list of such people. It was an awkward moment – not diplomatic at all – but Obama was clearly enjoying it. And, well he might, because neither Jim Acosta nor any of the other corporate mouthpieces in the White House press corps would dare, or even think, to ask a U.S. president about the plight of American political prisoners. 
The U.S. media traveling with Obama have easy access to all sorts of lists of Cubans who are supposedly in prison for opposition to the their government – although even Amnesty International says that the Cubans released their last political prisoner, back in September.
The United States, on the other hand, is still holding scores of political prisoners, many of them captured in the 1960s and 70s. Their numbers are decreasing only because they are dying of old age – accelerated by the inhuman conditions and practices of the world's largest prison system. If the corporate media were really concerned about political prisoners, they could go to the web site of the Jericho Movement and see the pictures of 50 of them. Eighteen were members of the Black Panther Party, the Black Liberation Army or the Republic of New Africa, including Mumia Abu Jamal, whose life hangs by a thread because the State of Pennsylvania refuses to treat his Hepatitis C. Black Panther Romaine ""Chip"" Fitzgerald has been incarcerated since 1969. There are men and women from the MOVE organization, all with the last name ""Africa,"" whose children were killed and their home bombed by the Philadelphia police. There are Native American activists from the First Nation group and American Indian Movement, including Leonard Peltier, who has been behind bars since 1976. There are white Class war, Anti-imperialist and Anarchist Hacker political prisoners, and, Marie Mason, a white Earth Liberation Front woman and Black female community activist Rev. Joy Powell. 
No Truce in This War
There are prisoners who became political after they were imprisoned – which is why they are still there. There are Chicano political prisoners and the great Puerto Rican independence fighter, Oscar Lopez Rivera. There is the former H. Rap Brown, who's doing life without parole as Imam Jamil Al-Amin. There are members of the Portland 7 and the Virgin Island 5 and the Ohio 7. There is the brilliant Mutulu Shakur, father of Tupac Shakur, who the feds say masterminded the escape and exile to Cuba of Assata Shakur. If Obama could somehow get her back behind bars in the U.S., he'd claim she wasn't a political prisoner, either.
The Jericho Movement's pictures do not include lots of other political prisoners, like Rev. Edward Pinkney, who's serving up to ten years in prison for non-violently standing up for the people of Benton Harbor, Michigan.
President Obama this week told the Cuban people, ""I Have Come Here To Bury The Last Remnant Of The Cold War."" But he won't end the long war against Black people in the United States, a war that has sent millions to prison under a political policy of mass Black Incarceration. In that sense, they are all political prisoners.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
""We arrive at the current election season with both corporate parties in a state of flux and an incipient Black movement that is anxious to transform the political landscape.""
Self-determination. It's a term that was once at the center of the Black political discussion. How should Black folks organize themselves to gain the power to shape their own destinies, and in the process, build a better world and break the power of our enemies? Black people in the United States made great strides when we engaged in mass mobilization under independent Black leadership with the focus on self-determination. WE set the terms of discussion, and put forward principled demands that were designed – always – to result in the accumulation of more power in the hands of our people. Sometimes that involved elections, but more often not, because elections only occur every two or four years, while the struggle for power and self-determination is constant. 
The Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations is putting Black people's self-determination back in the discussion this election season, with a National Conference on the 2016 Election and the Struggle for Self-Determination. The conference takes place on Saturday, April 9, at St. Mary's Church in Harlem, New York City. The Black Is Back Coalition will explore the possibilities and the dangers that the current electoral scene presents for the future of Black people and the world. This is a conference about power: the power to kick the killer cops out of our neighborhoods and establish Black community control of the police. The power to keep our people from being dispersed from the cities at the whim of rich corporations. The power to control our schools and the content and quality of our children's educations. The power that comes from economic security. The power to say Yes to our friends and No to our enemies.
""Movement"" Politics
The Black Is Back Coalition was founded in October, 2009, when a broad range of Black organizations decided to work together based on the principle of Black self-determination and the struggle against imperialism. President Obama had just begun his first term in office. The new Coalition understood that the election of a Black corporate Democrat to the highest office in the land was not a step towards Black self-determination.  In fact, it was quite the opposite. Obama's election meant that lots of Black folks would celebrate as their own incomes and wealth went further down the drain, and that many would cheering while a Black commander-in-chief slaughtered people of color all over the world. And we were right. 
But something else happened in the second half of Barack Obama's tenure in office: the beginnings of a mass movement. And so, we arrive at the current election season with both corporate parties in a state of flux and, most importantly, an incipient Black movement that is anxious to transform the political landscape through struggle outside the ballot box. Which is why the Black Is Back Coalition is holding a National Conference on the 2016 Election and the Struggle for Self-Determination, Saturday, April 9, at St. Mary's Church, at 521 West 126th Street, in Harlem, New York. To make arrangements, go to the Black Is Back Coalition web site. Because Black Power matters.

A poll commissioned by In The Public Interest shows Americans still hold public schools and teachers in high regard, want charter schools to conform to the same standards as conventional public schools, and oppose an over emphasis on standardized testing.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Turkey has cashed in on the people it has helped make homeless.""
Europe, which ravaged the world for 500 hundred years, exterminating hundreds of millions in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific – Europe, which owes the rest of humanity a debt of blood and treasure that it can never repay, last week announced that its victims should give up all hope of sanctuary from the wars, enforced poverty, civil chaos, and environmental devastation that Europeans have inflicted on the darker and non-Christian peoples of the planet. European Council president Donald Tusk warned millions of refugees from Asia and Africa, ""Do not come to Europe... It is all for nothing."" He was putting the last bricks in a wall that is far larger, and vastly more unjust, than anything ever erected in Berlin.
And this week Turkey – whose Ottoman empire was consumed by Europe, and has ever since begged to be accepted as a member of the European tribe – sealed a deal that essentially sells the lives of millions of refugees in exchange for semi-European status and billions of dollars. The Turks accepted $3.8 billion to keep the nearly 3 million refugees that have gathered on its soil from crossing over into Europe, a vastly richer place, but one that claims it cannot absorb any more Africans and Arabs and Kurds and Afghans and others that are non-white and/or non-Christian. 
Turkey Still Striving to be Recognized as White
The great bulk of Turkey's refugees are victims of Turkey's role in the war against Syria, in alliance with Europe and the United States and the royal oil aristocrats of the Persian Gulf. In effect, Turkey has cashed in on the people it has helped make homeless, and established a human trafficking enterprise on a scale not seen since the Atlantic slave trade. This ghastly crime against humanity is further compounded through blackmail among the thieves and plunderers, as Turkey springs its vast protections racket trap – agreeing to protect Europe from further incursions from the formerly colonized peoples whose labor and lands have fattened Europe and its white settler states for half a millennium. 
There is a further condition to Turkey's cooperation. The regime in Ankara wants Turks – all 75 million of them – to be allowed to enter Europe without visa restrictions, and for reconsideration of Turkey's request to join the European Union. Nearly a century after the French and British divided the Ottoman Turk empire among themselves, Turkey is still striving to be recognized, in European terms, as white. Certainly, Turkey is playing by all the European rules: as a member of NATO, it violates international law and wages aggressive war with impunity; it trafficks in the flesh of its neighbors, Muslims, Christians, Arabs, Africans, Afghans – anyone who can be bought, sold or bartered; and yet Turkey holds itself up as a model of civilization. However, the Europeans will never accept Turkey into the fold, because it is Muslim and not-quite-white, and so Turkey will have to prowl and growl on the periphery – a wannabe European. 
Or, have a revolution, and come to its senses.

High Corporate Crimes In Michigan Must be Terminated with Extreme Prejudice
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The State of Michigan itself has done ""irreparable harm"" to the schools and people of Detroit.""
Next week, on March 7, Steve Conn and Nicole Conoway are scheduled to appear before a Michigan judge to explain why they should not be legally prohibited from urging Detroit teachers to stage sickouts and an eventual citywide strike to halt the state's methodical destruction of the city's public schools. Ms. Conoway is a teacher and Mr. Conn was elected president of the Detroit teachers union, before the union's butt-kissing national leadership deposed him. Conn and his allies at the activist organization BAMN, By Any Means Necessary, spearheaded a series of teacher sickouts that focused national attention on the appalling conditions in Detroit's schools, which have been literally ground into the dirt by the state for 16 of the past 17 years. The State of Michigan will try to prove that Conn and Conoway must be silenced – their First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly snatched away – because the sickouts have supposedly subjected the schools to ""irreparable harm.""
It is, of course, the State of Michigan itself that has done ""irreparable harm"" to the schools and people of Detroit, through the exact same mechanism that the State used to inflict irreparable harm on the bodies and brains of the children and community of Flint, Michigan. Both were targeted by Gov. Rick Synder's dictatorial emergency financial manager system, whose mission in Flint was to privatize the water supply, and in Detroit, to convert what's left of the public schools to privately-run charters. 
Depraved Indifference to Human Life
Recently-released email records show that Gov. Synder's underlings knew for a full year that potentially irreparable harm was being done to the majority Black population of Flint. Yet, the state made no attempt to deal with high levels of lead and other poisons in the city's water – proof of the Snyder administration's depraved indifference to human life, the same depraved indifference that it showed to the students, teachers and parents of Detroit. As Pamela Pugh, treasurer of Michigan's elected Board of Education has written, ""After more than six years of a failed state takeover, Detroit Public Schools have deteriorated into a destabilized education system...."" She continued: ""Just as Flint's water crisis occurred under emergency management, so did the demise of the Detroit school district.""
Darnell Earley was the Black henchman for Gov. Snyder's crimes against humanity in both Flint and the Detroit schools – a killer for hire with the title of emergency financial manager. Under corporate rule, high finance is the motive for the highest of crimes, while the exercise of free speech and assembly and other fundamental democratic rights are criminalized. In Michigan, the ""predicate crime,"" as lawyers would call it, was theft of democracy in the state's Black cities, from which all the other crimes flowed. But the only people that are at risk of losing their liberties on March 7 are Steve Conn and Nicole Conoway, for attempting to organize their fellow teachers, parents and community members for the survival of public education in Detroit. 
Michigan is showing that the corporate and financial classes of the United States can no longer coexist with democratic institutions, especially when Black people's rights are at issue. Either we get rid of them, or they get rid of us.

""The Republican Party might also collapse under the pressure of the 'angry' white men and women"" supporting Donald Trump, said Dr. Monteiro. ""The situation is so dynamic and unlike anything that we have experienced since the Civil War and Reconstruction.""
Detroit Teachers Move Towards City-Wide Strike
Steven Conn, the elected leader of the Detroit teachers union who was deposed by the union's national leadership, said a city-wide strike is the only way to save the public schools from the machinations of Gov. Rick Snyder and his appointed emergency managers. Snyder wants to divide the Detroit's public schools into two districts: one heavily indebted, the other debt-free. Conn said that's a scheme ""to allow the charter school operators to take over the schools without having to make any payback to the school district of the huge amount of debt that the State of Michigan has run up since its control of the district for the last 16 years.""
Teach For America's Job Protection Racket
A new study of Teach for America contracts showed TFA collects hefty ""finders' fees"" to place its neophyte teachers in classrooms in Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans and New York. Jameson Brewer, who led the study, said TFA contracts provide broad protection for its members' jobs, while veteran traditional teachers are laid off. ""Parents don't know that their children are being taught by novice educators who've had two and a half days of training,"" said Brewer.

""In addition to the dirty tricks and hyper-surveillance of the U.S. national security state, activists are also in the crosshairs of the Israeli secret services.""
 ""This time around, the cyber war will be targeting Americans, Europeans and anyone else that challenges the 'legitimacy' of the world's sole surviving colonial apartheid state.""
The Israeli government is pouring $26 million and tasking many of its secret service scientists and dirty tricks operatives to wage a digital war against BDS – the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions movement. An Associated Press article, picked up by AlterNet, reports the Israelis have already targeted, and made to disappear, web pages that are linked to BDS websites. An Israeli corporate executive said the mission is to dismantle the digital infrastructure of groups in Europe, the United States and South America that Tel Aviv considers to be anti-Semitic. The Israeli government position is that everyone that supports the BDS movement is anti-Semitic, because they want to ""delegitimize"" the Zionist state. 
Hillary Clinton agrees with Israel. In a letter to a billionaire fundraiser, Clinton said, ""I know you agree that we need to make countering BDS a priority,"" and she promised to help ""fight back against further attempts to isolate and delegitimize Israel."" Clinton has collaborated in Israeli cyber wars before. She was Secretary of State in 2010 when the Stuxnet program, a joint U.S. and Israeli digital assault against Iranian centrifuges, was discovered. This time around, the cyber war will not be targeting Iran, or the Chinese, but Americans, Europeans and anyone else that challenges the ""legitimacy"" of the world's sole surviving colonial apartheid state. American supporters of the BDS movement cannot expect that their rights to free speech and association will be protected Democrats or Republicans in Washington – not when it comes to the legitimacy of Israel. 
Decent Humankind vs. Israeli Apartheid
The emerging movement that goes under the heading of Black Lives Matter should take note. In addition to the dirty tricks and hyper-surveillance of the U.S. national security state, activists are also in the crosshairs of the Israeli secret services. Israel was white-ruled South Africa's closest military ally for the simple reason that they were both white settler, apartheid states rooted in an ideology of ethnic supremacy. In 1975, the Zionist regime in Tel Aviv offered to sell the white regime in Pretoria nuclear weapons ""in three sizes."" The Israelis feared that, should white minority rule collapse in South Africa, Israel would be the only apartheid regime left standing on the planet. They could no longer claim to be, at least, not quite as bad as South Africa. But, as Bishop Desmond Tutu and others have concluded, apartheid Israel is actually worse than apartheid South Africa, both in its genocidal policies against the Palestinians, and as a constant threat to the survival of the planet. 
The term ""illegitimate"" doesn't comes close to describing a state that is an affront, an insult, to the very notion of civilization. All decent people must oppose Israeli apartheid. Unfortunately, Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez and Lisa Keys are not decent people; they have no problem performing in Israel. The Congressional Black Caucus is not composed of decent people; their junkets to Israel are must-attend events, and they joined with all the other members of Congress in a Resolution in support of Israeli at the moment the apartheid regime was slaughtering thousands of Palestinians in Gaza. But, a Black Lives Matter movement must be decent – and internationalist. And, to that extent, its activists will be targeted by the world's last apartheid state.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The American ""coalition"" never tried to militarily defeat ISIS in Syria or Iraq.""
The five year-long U.S.-led proxy war against Syria is about to spiral out of control, with possibly fatal consequences for the human race. The Obama administration's web of lies, intrigue, and relentless aggression has turned Syria into the world's most insane field of battle, where both the United States and Russia provide air cover to Kurdish forces that are being shelled by America's NATO ally, Turkey. Turkey has also been shelling units of the Syrian army, operating under Russia's protection. With 18,000 Turkish soldiers poised at the border, a Turkish invasion of Syria is considered imminent, and will likely include Saudi Arabian troops and aircraft – all of which would become targets for Russian air defense systems the second they violate Syrian land and air space. Should Turkey and Russia come to blows, which is entirely possible within the next few days, the Turks could block the Bosphorus Straits, closing off access to and from the Black Sea, bottling up Russian naval forces and provoking a world war. The Turks temporally blocked the door to the Black Sea back in December, after they shot down a Russian plane.
Meanwhile, western governments, their royal Arab allies, and the global corporate media scream for some kind of so-called ""humanitarian"" intervention in northern Syria – a transparent call for the United States to activate its so-called ""Plan B"" – an all-out U.S. military offensive against...who?
The United States will claim it's against the Islamic State. These days, the U.S. claims everything it does in Syria and in Iraq is part of the fight against the Islamic State. But, of course, there never was a U.S. war against the Islamic State, which spread like wildfire until the Russian air force intervened in late September. The U.S., the Brits, the French, Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf kleptocracies financed and armed all of the jihadist gangs that descended on Syria after 2011, and although the Islamic State decided that it had plans of its own, the American ""coalition"" never tried to militarily defeat ISIS in Syria or Iraq. ISIS was still useful, to wear down the Syrian army and keep the Iraqi government off balance and dependent on the United States.
""A Turkish invasion of Syria is considered imminent.""
The success of the Russian intervention changed all that. Under Plan B, the United States and its allies will move militarily to absorb the Islamic State and take over the Syrian territory the jihadists now occupy, de facto dismembering Syria. The surviving ISIS fighters would fight on under U.S. protection, distributed among other jihadist groups and under new political labels. At least, that appears to be the plan. 
However, the Turks have their own agenda. Turkish President Recep Erdogan has staked his political life on defeating and humiliating the Kurds, in his own country and in Syria. But, the United States has made a huge investment in acting as the ""protector"" of the Iraqi Kurds, in order to dismember and control Iraq, and the Americans are trying to play the same game with the Syrian Kurds. That's why the U.S. is providing air cover to some Syrian Kurdish units, while the Turks are shelling other Kurds who operate under Russian air cover, 60 miles away. The Turks don't like the game the Americans are playing, and are threatening to invade Syria, confront the Russians, and force the U.S. to choose between Turkey, or the Kurds, or World War Three. This is a very dangerous moment for the planet.

Heads Should Roll Over Flint – Like Watergate
""What did they know, and when did they know it?"" That's the question Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo would pose to everyone involved in the poisoning of Flint, Michigan, including Gov. Rick Snyder, EPA chief Gina McCarthy and, ultimately, President Obama himself.

Failure to warn the public of imminent environmental danger ""is a criminal offense,"" she said.
Black and Brown Cities Disenfranchised
The poisoning of Flint began with the theft of democracy, through the imposition of state appointed emergency financial managers. ""This is a form of taxation without representation,"" said Larry Hamm, chairman of the Newark, New Jersey-based People's Organization for Progress, which held protests in solidarity with the people of Flint. ""I don't know of any white cities in America where this has occurred,"" said Hamm, noting that local schools in Black and brown districts have long been targeted for state takeover.

A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""Fans and critics alike have over-interpreted Beyoncé's latest commercial product.""
Only two days and one Superbowl performance after Beyoncé released her video, ""Formation,"" the song had registered 7 million views on YouTube. These numbers are not really all that surprising for an artist who is rated the nation's number one celebrity, with a net worth of $250 million and the highest yearly earnings record. Beyoncé and her multi-millionaire husband Jay-Z are by no stretch of the imagination political radicals. But they do know how to ride the waves of popular culture, putting their own signatures on existing social movements. It's good business, and they are good at it. 
Beyoncé and her platoon of female dancers generated maximum shock-and-awe value with her fifth career Superbowl performance, derived from the ""Formation"" single. Beyoncé was bedecked with a bandolier for high-powered ammunition, while her dancers were costumed in Black Panther-themed uniforms as they moved in military-like ""formations"" and formed a giant ""X"" – presumably signifying Malcolm. In the video, a young boy dances in front of a line of cops, as the camera flashes to graffiti demanding ""Stop Shooting Us."" We immediately make the connection to 12 year-old Tamir Rice, murdered by Cleveland cops – except in the video, the police put up their hands in surrender to the dancing child. New Orleans is the motif for Beyoncé's rhythmic fantasy, which ends with her atop a police car as it sinks beneath the flood waters.
Black Lives Spend Money
Fans and critics alike have over-interpreted Beyoncé's latest commercial product – as if it provides an insight into her and her husband Jay-Z's political leanings. A National Pubic Radio article features Black female intellectuals and journalists pontificating on the boldness of Beyoncé's Blackness and womanhood, and her roots in the down-and-dirty quarters of the South. R. L. Stephens II, writing in the radical publication Orchestrated Pulse, complains that ""Formation"" fails to inform us about the ""political conditions"" that Black people face. He points out that Beyoncé is a supporter and Twitter follower of DeRay McKesson, who has turned a social media presence into a ticket into the V.I.P. sections of corporate power and the Democratic Party.
But, of course, DeRay McKesson is only of interest to the Power Structure because he opportunistically attached himself to an emerging social movement, the same Black Lives Matter movement from which Beyoncé and her spouse hope to derive social relevancy – and of course, tens of millions more in sales. 
In the video, the Beyoncé character calls herself a ""Black Bill Gates in the making"" and is money-hungry to the bone. This is not a radical song. What it does, is signify that Beyoncé wants to be perceived as being down with the new movement. It's much like soul singer James Brown's musical endorsement of ""Black"" as the proud name of his people, in his 1968 hit record. Brown was, in fact, a deeply conservative businessman who would endorse – or betray – anyone, to guard his bankroll. Beyoncé and Jay-Z have no political principles except profit-making. But they, like James Brown, recognize the potential of an awakening people, and try to get with the ""movement."" In that sense, the ""movement"" is the rising star – and that is the point of the matter.

104037195986_10153879926925987,"Going ""International"" on Racist Uncle Sam
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""When activists go the UN offices in Geneva, Switzerland, to document the barbarity and racism of the U.S. criminal justice system, Washington is compelled to respond.""
Advocates of reparations and Black community control of the police got a boost from a panel of the United Nations, last week. The UN's ""Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent"" heard testimony in five cities on violations of Black Americans' human rights. The experts will issue a full report to the United Nations Human Rights Council, in September, but their preliminary statement paints a picture of endemic racial oppression in criminal justice, education, housing, employment, health care – virtually every aspect of life in the USA. 
Of course, the United Nations is not going to force the U.S. to pay reparations to its Black citizens, or compel America to remove its blue-uniformed army of occupation from Black communities. Only Black Americans, themselves, can make that happen. However, the UN's critique of U.S. racial policies and practices is important. Even a corporate-ruled, imperialist superpower, born in slavery and genocide, can be embarrassed when its crimes are revealed on the world stage. President Eisenhower was a segregationist, but he could not act like one when the world was watching the Black American struggle against Jim Crow segregation in the 1950s. In the Sixties, Malcolm X urged Black people to take their human rights grievances to the United Nations, where the seats in the General Assembly were filling up with delegates from the formerly colonized countries of the world. Under the gaze of global humanity, the United States pretended to welcome the end of official American apartheid. 
""The African American reputation in the world has been in dire need of rehabilitation."" 
Nowadays, President Obama attempts to convince the world that the U.S. would really like to get rid of mass Black incarceration – although he'd have to release 7 out of every 8 prisoners to bring U.S. incarceration rates down to 1970 levels. Still, when activists go the UN offices in Geneva, Switzerland, to document the barbarity and racism of the U.S. criminal justice system, Washington is compelled to respond.
Half a century ago, Black Americans earned the respect and admiration of struggling peoples all over the world, because we were perceived as waging a heroic fight for justice and human rights, here in the belly of the beast. And, although the Black Panther Party has been defunct in the U.S. for two generations, people in places like India and even New Zealand still proudly call themselves Black Panthers.
However, the Black American reputation has suffered over the years. The world has seen us represented by the likes of Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and now the mad bomber in the White House and his genocidal national security advisor Susan Rice, the individual most closely identified with the slaughter of six million Congolese. With all of these Black American war criminals and fiends strutting around the world stage, the African American reputation has been in dire need of rehabilitation. 
But then Ferguson intervened, and Black America seemed like it might have rediscovered its soul. Black folks are actually making demands of power – and the United Nations is paying attention. There is hope for us, yet.

The Haitian people's furious resistance to yet another fraudulent presidential election has scuttled U.S. plans to replace ""Sweet Mickey"" Martelly with another flunky named the ""Banana Man."" The aborted fraud is a reminder that Secretary of State Clinton was an imperial bully who rigged the previous presidential election in Haiti and stole the country blind, along with her accomplice and husband, Bill. Those chickens may yet come home to roost.
The Clintons: ""We Came, We Stole, Haitians Died"" 
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford
""The discrediting of the elections would also reflect very badly on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.""
The island nation of Haiti is on the verge of finally ejecting the criminal President Michel ""Sweet Mickey"" Martelly, the dance hall performer and gangster who was foisted on the Haitian people by the United States through the bullying of then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, back in 2011. Martelly's term is up, and he is constitutionally required to leave office by February 7. Martelly and his American, French and Canadian backers had hoped to use rigged elections and strong-arm tactics to install another puppet politician, Jovenel ""The Banana Man"" Moise, in the presidential palace. The ""Banana Man"" – who wants to turn Haiti into a real banana-exporting republic, to the further impoverishment of its small farmers – came in first in an October election that was so blatantly stolen, even the thoroughly corrupt Haitian elite could not endorse the outcome. 
In fact, virtually no one in Haitian society except the ""Banana Man"" and ""Sweet Mickey"" and the tens thousands of Haitians who were paid to vote, repeatedly, at different polling places in October, considered the election to be valid. Jude Célestin, the candidate that came in second in the October electoral farce – and who was also cheated of victory by ""Sweet Mickey"" Martelly in the election five years ago – refused to go along with the travesty. Célestin said he would not take part in the bogus run-off election that was scheduled for this past Sunday – meaning, the ""Banana Man"" would have been the only candidate. 
""Hillary and Bill were the Bonnie and Clyde of Haiti.""
But, even the prospect of a one-man contest could not stop the Americans from insisting on going ahead with the run-off. The U.S., which pays for the Haitian elections and, therefore, believes it has the right to decide who wins and who loses, growled that Haiti should go along with the fraudulent process. The Americans were upset that they might have no reliable replacement for their loyal puppet, ""Sweet Mickey."" Plus, the discrediting of the elections would also reflect very badly on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who claims to have brought stability to Haiti when she was at the State Department but, in fact, is culpable for all of the Haitians who were murdered by the Martelly regime. The truth is that Hillary and Bill were the Bonnie and Clyde of Haiti, robbing the country for their own and other corporate criminals' benefit. The teams of FBI agents that are now matching Hillary's emails with contributions to the Clinton Foundation are tapping a Mother Lode of corruption that may yet bring her down before Election Day in the United States.
If that happens, the Haitian people will deserve some of the credit for saving the U.S. from another period of rule by the Crooked Clintons, in the process of saving Haiti's sovereignty and self-respect. The Haitians' furious grassroots resistance forced the cancellation of Sunday's run-off election; ""Sweet Mickey"" is slated to leave office in less than two weeks; and negotiations are underway to form an interim government that would hold clean elections. The struggle now is for Haiti's poor majority to make its voice heard above the growling of the U.S. imperialist occupiers and their hired Haitian flunkies – some of whom are real killers, whose names aren't funny at all.

After a state-appointed emergency financial manager poisoned the people of Flint, Michigan, with tainted water, you'd expect that other governors would think twice before tampering with the water supplies of poor cities. But, you'd be wrong. New Jersey Governor Chris Christy last year put Atlantic City under an emergency financial manager, and gave him a year to slash the ailing gambling town's budget and prepare a full report. Kevin Lavin is a corporate turnaround expert with an international consulting firm. He was assisted in his dictatorial assignment by a fellow Black corporate type, also named Kevyn – Kevyn Orr, who had just finished stealing the last vestiges of democracy from the people of Detroit on behalf of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder. In fact, every heavily Black city in Michigan was taken over by Governor Snyder, effectively disenfranchising fully half of the state's Black citizens. 
Apparently, Governor Christy thought that would be a good move for New Jersey, too, and he set his sights on Atlantic City, an overwhelmingly Black and Brown town that had just lost four of its casinos, and is now about to lose another one. One-third of Atlantic City's 40,000 people live below the poverty line. With whites comprising only about 16 percent of the population, Christy must have reasoned that nobody important would stand in the way of whatever he wanted to do to Atlantic City. And, he was right. Emergency manager Kevin Lavin's report calls for regionalizing the police department and privatizing the fire department. But even worse, the Democratic president of the state senate, Stephen Sweeney, has introduced a bill that would sell most of Atlantic City's assets, including its water department. 
But, it gets worse than that. Not only is the top Democrat in New Jersey more enthusiastic about corporate privatization than Republican Chris Christy, but the president of the local Unite-Here union has also endorsed the sell-off of city property and the further disenfranchisement of its citizens – many of them union members. 
The Corporate Party Rules
Corporate Republicans, corporate Democrats, and corporate unions – all oppose the very concept of democracy, home rule and self-determination for poor Black and brown people. Indeed, New Jersey has a very long history of taking power away from local governments as soon as Blacks and Latinos become majorities. The takeovers are always cloaked as necessary to avoid financial disaster – but, since Black and brown cities are perpetually out of cash, what it really means is that poor people don't deserve basic democratic rights.
Ron Rice, a state senator from majority Black Newark, sees the writing on the wall. ""It's Atlantic City today, it is Newark tomorrow,"" he said at a rally against privatization. Senator Rice insists that ""We have to mobilize people and shut down some things,"" and ""get back to doing what we did in the '60s.""
Which is true. But, this time around, we must understand that everyone who serves the corporate master is the enemy: including Black corporate hit-men, corporate Democrats, and corporate hacks in union clothing.

U.S. Demands Global Respect, But Disrespects Its Own Black Citizens
President Obama's polices, ""both foreign and domestic, are the same as any leader of the Empire,"" said South Carolina activist and author Kevin Alexander Gray, editor of Killing Trayvons: An Anthology of American Violence. U.S. corporate media ""cried"" about Iran forcing U.S. sailors to put their hands up, but the sailors ""were given a greater amount of deference and respect than Tamir Rice got from the police, and that Michael Brown got from the police,"" said Gray. ""It seemed that Iran respected America's sailors' rights more than America and American police departments respect the rights of Black people"" in the U.S.
Obama Most Aggressive Imperial President
Over the last seven years, Barack Obama has ""asserted imperialist power more than any other president,"" said Black Agenda Report senior columnist Margaret Kimberley. ""Reagan tried to kill [Libyan leader Muammar] Gaddafi, but then said, Oh, never mind; Obama actually did it,"" said Kimberley. ""Other presidents thought about trying to take out the Syrian president, but it was the Democrat, Obama, who tried to make that a reality."" Obama has ""left no stone unturned in attacking the rest of the world."" 
Obama Set Venezuela Up for Subversion
The ""deceptive nature of President Obama"" fooled lots of world leaders into thinking his tenure would be different, said Cynthia McKinney, the former six-term congresswoman from Georgia and 2008 Green Party presidential candidate. ""During the campaign, candidate Obama was Abraham Lincoln, he was Franklin Roosevelt, he was John Kennedy, he was Martin Luther King Jr., he was all of those personalities we revere,"" said McKinney, whose PhD dissertation was on the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez. ""I think the openness with which people received President Obama was abused, and allowed the nefarious polices"" of U.S. subversion of Venezuela's government.
Haitians Say No to Another Rigged Election
Another round of Haitian elections is scheduled for January 24, despite opposition from nearly everyone except the ruling party and its U.S. backers. Irregularities marred almost half the ballot sheets in the first round of elections. ""It's not just opposition politicians who are formally against this process, but also a wide range of human rights organizations, diaspora organizations, religious leaders, etc.,"" said Jake Johnston, a researcher for the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research. 
U.S. Continues Legacy of Oppression in Congo
The United States is trying to influence upcoming elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo, luring student activists with offers of money. Washington is always up to no good in the Congo, according to Kambale Musavuli, of Friends of Congo. ""The United States was the first country to recognize Congo as the personal property of [Belgian King] Leopold in the late 1800s,"" said Musavuli. ""The United States backed the killing of Patrice Lumumba, the first elected prime minister of the Congo. They supported a dictator who was imposed on the Congolese people for 32 years,"" and ""they supported an invasion of the Congo by Rwanda and Uganda that has taken the lives of millions of Congolese.""

Philadelphia Conference Reasserts Black Radical Tradition
Hundreds of activists, academics and organizers from around the country descended on Temple University, in Philadelphia, January 8-10, for a conference titled ""Reclaiming Our Future: The Black Radical Tradition."" The multi-generational crowd heard presentations from Angela Davis, Cornel West, Anthony Monteiro and Charlene Carruthers, of Chicago's Black Youth Project 100, and took part in panel discussions on the widest range of issues, from war and peace, to police and prisons, to gentrification, queer resistance, and emancipatory culture.
A Devastating Critique of Campaign Zero's DeRay McKesson
At a panel on ""Challenging White Supremacy,"" Umi Saleh, the Dream Defenders activist formerly known as Phillip Agnew, said social media provides ""an asylum for neoliberal values...at the expense of building real community power."" Saleh blasted Campaign Zero leader DeRay McKesson for ""counter-revolutionary and anti-movement"" agitation against building grassroots organizations. Too often in social media, ""We aren't fighting white supremacy,"" he said, ""we are vying for virtual validation."" Twitter-based social media activists like McKesson are ""crowned"" leaders, but have no notion social responsibility. ""Social media cannot replace the work that organizers must do,"" said Saleh.
Accountability, New Leadership and Socialism
Veteran organizer Jamala Rogers, author of the new book Ferguson is America: Roots of Rebellion, agreed that ""you can't have a principled debate in 140 characters"" on Twitter. ""We hold white supremacy accountable, but we don't hold ourselves accountable,"" she said. Activists must address critical questions, such as ""Where are the working class leaders that we are developing as a movement?"" and ""Why aren't we projecting our aversion to capitalism?"" Bernie Sanders, a ""gray haired, old white man,"" openly espouses socialism, ""but we're scared,"" said Rogers. 
Fight White Supremacy, Defeat Capitalism
Longtime activist, UCLA history professor and author Robin D.G. Kelly pointed to the ""democratic revolutionary vision"" of the 1960s National Welfare Rights Organization, the Black Panther and Young Lords parties, and even the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which in 1964 called for a national minimum income, an end to the draft, withdrawal from Vietnam and a boycott of South Africa. Later, however, Black elected officials ""helped manage the transfer of wealth to the rich"" and promoted schemes for ""multiculturalism and diversity"" which, ultimately, ""do not disrupt white supremacy.""

""It's an attempt to create an easy fix and a non-racial fix."" Michael Brown, Eric Garner and countless others were not killed by cops shooting automatic rifles from the tops of armored vehicles.
