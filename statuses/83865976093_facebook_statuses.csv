Every day, we're putting our all into publishing the truth about this brutal administration. We run on an extremely tight budget considering the amount we accomplish: As our publisher Joe Macaré put it, we run a daily national publication on a local budget. Unlike almost any outlet you can think of, we don't take ads or corporate sponsors, we don't partner with the Democratic Party, and we don't sell our email list. This means we get to be truly independent and publish amazing, rad stuff (which is why I love this organization so darn much)! It also means staying alive can be hard, and we need your help right now. Giving to Truthout is a way that you can take action. I hope that those of you who are able to donate will do so.",Donate,link,http://www.truth-out.org/donate-now,2017-02-28 17:30:00,38,1,14,31,6,1,0,0,0

Donald Trump is keenly aware of the power of media to influence people and he's working to lock it down. Unfortunately, the mainstream media is playing along -- attending off-the-record meetings and keeping their headlines euphemistic -- whether out of fear or a desire to keep access to power.

At Truthout, we don't seek access to power and we won't be intimidated into editorial compliance. We work tirelessly to prevent a future where only far-right media has a voice. Can you help us raise the $8,000 more we still need in order to keep doing that?

But the real question is: What do we do now? For us at Truthout, as grim as this morning feels, the answer is that we will re-commit to doing the hard work that needs to be done. We must all protect the people who are most likely to be targeted by the Trump administration, we must listen to them and we must amplify their voices.

We will redouble our efforts to bring you the truth about white supremacy, about voter suppression, about attacks on the rights of workers, women, immigrants, Muslims, Black and Brown and Indigenous people and all people of color, trans and other LGBT people -- and of course so many people who fall into many of those categories. We will cover the threat of yet more war, surveillance and militarism and we will cover the efforts of the brave people who we believe will come together in resistance.

Truthout has always been committed to holding elected officials of all stripes accountable, while being unafraid to say that we are not unbiased and objective when it comes to injustice, to inequality, to corruption, bigotry and hate. Nothing will deter us from our mission. We hope you will continue to join us in fighting for a better future, no matter the odds.

Maya Schenwar, one of the book's editors, will moderate the panel. Early copies of ""Who Do You Serve? Who Do You Protect?"" will be available for purchase — and contributors will be available to sign them!

The slogan used on police patrol cars across the country, To Protect and Serve, is remarkably unspecific. Who — or what — is being protected? Who is being served? What are police actually doing in the United States, and toward what ends?
 
For us, the question is not, ""How do we confront the fact that police are doing things that are wrong?"" But rather, ""How do we confront the institution of policing as a whole — an institution whose entire grounding and current practice is wrong?""

In this discussion, we will tackle the fundamental violence of policing and how we might move beyond this institution to a world where state violence does not systematically control people's lives.
