It leads idiots to posit complicated alternative plots to straightforward crimes.  Here's a perfectly clear story about an (ex-con) Uber driver drugging a customer's water, then robbing him after dropping him at home -- but a reader thinks he's figured out the REAL story. 

ACTUAL STORY:  http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/hialeah/article131857254.html

READER'S VERSION IN THE ""COMMENTS"":

Lex Luke
i have never had an uber driver offer me water and none of them were a lovely lady. Story sounds fishy. Me thinks the customer offered to solicit a casual sexual encounter with the lady. He wasn't wowed by her performance so makes up a story. Story is definately fishy when the homeowner doesn't remember leaving his home 2 hours later which his own surveillance system recorded. Interesting last paragraph on the story. ""He noted how identity thieves are now trying to rob other identity thieves' houses for personal identification information, similar to what happens when drug dealers hit other drug dealers' stashes to steal drugs."" The homeowner (alleged victim) is infering that he himself is an identity thief and a drug dealer.

Pauperized Workers Are Price of 'Free' Trade

To the Editor:

The foreign-trade deal ... assumes that unregulated foreign trade - always called ''free trade'' - automatically benefits both nations involved, this viewpoint makes light of the one-sidedness of United States trade. The net takeover of our markets by excess imports, and the shrinkage of our industries and jobs, is attributed to some outside factor, and token policies are devised to deal with these imaginary causes.

Saving the economic future of the United States requires the regulation of United States imports to bring about balanced, two-way-benefit trade with countries that differ from us in economic policies and institutions, market sizes and qualities, wage levels and other ways.

The widening spread in American incomes and the worsening plight of our ordinary workers is shown by data and has been viewed with concern by many commentators. Americans were once proud of being the only country where the factory parking lot was filled with the workers' cars - cars of one-income families. 

Two incomes may not permit workers to raise a family in today's United States, and the situation is continuing to worsen.
History provides an illuminating parallel. The ancient Roman Republic became politically unworkable largely because the jobs of ordinary Roman workers and small farmers were taken over by cheaper outside labor, in this case by burgeoning use of imported slave labor. Slave labor was cheaper than the labor of free Romans. Thus, ''the free market'' said, ''Use the slave labor.'' 

Doing so enriched Roman landowners and the affluent. But the shift to slave labor took away the jobs of ordinary Romans, who had been the backbone of Rome's armies and state. They became an unemployed proletariat in the city of Rome, degraded by politicians' free bread and circuses - and Rome as a republic stopped working.

The United States turned the jobs of its ordinary workers over to outside labor - because it was cheaper than American labor - by accepting imports vastly in excess of our exports, imports that are cheaper than American-made goods because of foreign wage levels a tenth or less as high (as was initially true of Japan, which now relies on other advantages over United States production). One-sided immigration of low-wage labor has the same effect. 

The Americans whose jobs are given away to outside labor, like the pauperized Roman workers and farmers, will not go away. They have no place to go. They are finding that the available temporary jobs, the part-time jobs, the minimum-wage jobs without job security, medical insurance and retirement benefits do not permit them to live and raise a family like other Americans - not even when both spouses work. What is to become of these people? What will become of a United States in which groups not subject to such foreign competition live extravagantly, while the ordinary workers thrown by one-sided foreign trade into wage competition with the poorest of the world's burgeoning millions of poor become outcasts in their own country?

The economic theory on which United States policy is based evades this problem by assuming an imaginary world in which unemployment is cured by lowering wage levels, where foreign trade and job shifts automatically balance out and where cheaper implies more efficient. ...

But in the world of reality, the United States is self-destructing in permitting one-sided ''free trade'' to throw ordinary American workers into competition with hundreds of millions of foreign workers who can live on much less than they. This kind of ''free trade'' may be a time bomb of laissez-faire ideology more deadly even than ''free'' savings and loan association pillaging, ''free'' airline mergers, ''free'' liquidate-American-industry takeover deals, the ''free'' selling of America to foreigners and ''free'' government spending without taxes.

Race ballot measure would be divisive;
Michigan needs to to address the reasons for affirmative action, which are failing schools that leave minorities academically behind

BYLINE: Betsy DeVos

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. 17A

LENGTH: 783 words

When I waded into the debate on a proposed anti-affirmative action ballot initiative in Michigan, I gained quite a few new friends -- and enemies. This is a topic that causes people to get emotional.

No matter how well-intentioned, a ballot initiative designed to eliminate affirmative action programs in higher education here in Michigan could very well result in 18 months of vitriolic public discourse that centers on racial issues.

While the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision was a mixed bag, it very clearly struck down the University of Michigan's race-based point system for undergraduate admissions. It has been evident to me that the great majority of people in Michigan agree with the Supreme Court's finding that U-M system was unconstitutional. 

Most folks saw that system, which awarded 20 admission points to every applicant from some minority groups, as unfair, if not simply ridiculous. Rightly so.

And the court approved U-M Law School's approach to affirmative action that did not use such a point system.

So the question now is: What good will be served by a ballot initiative? The potential for a racially divisive campaign, complete with the typical kinds of irresponsible rhetoric that often comes from both sides, is my chief concern.

I cling to the idea that race is irrelevant and should be irrelevant. Frankly, I don't relish the idea of talking about race for the next two years. Remember those words about people being judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character? It's pretty hard to argue with them.

Here's an idea: How about we all see each other as Michiganians and forget about race? How about One Michigan?

Many have contended that there are partisan politics behind my position. They are right in one sense: I am dead serious about attracting far greater levels of support and participation in the Republican Party from African-Americans, Hispanics, and people of every background and ethnicity.

Some have suggested that a proposed ballot initiative will skew the turnout of voters one way or the other. That is not likely. The fact is that turnout in presidential years is fairly consistent. The winners of every election can be counted on to claim that they turned their vote out. And the losers will always complain that they would have won if their voters had only turned out, and it was all someone else's fault.

Some have accused the Michigan GOP of opposing the proposed ballot initiative because it would increase turnout among predominantly Democratic constituencies. The fact is, as chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, I favor 100 percent turnout of all eligible voters -- regardless of race, creed, party affiliation or any other man-made measurement. We have great confidence in our vision for the state and the country, and we believe that higher turnout will always be to our benefit.

Let me be very clear on one thing: I do not pretend to stand in the way of people who disagree with me on the wisdom of a ballot initiative. It's still a free country; democracy still works, and we have a wide range of views in the Republican Party.

But I have a radical idea. Just for a change, let's have the guts, in both political parties, to address the root cause rather than the symptom. The plain fact is that the reason for the perceived need for affirmative action in college admission policies is very simple.

Some say minority kids aren't as smart. Try again.

Some say minority kids don't have as much money. Try again.

Some say minority kids' schools don't receive enough money. Try again.

The real reason is very obvious: Far too many minority kids are being left behind because they attend schools that fail them. They are stuck in under-performing schools in their K-12 years, and they have no choice in the matter. Their families don't have the money to move to better-performing school districts or to place them in an alternative school of their choosing.

Make no mistake about it: We have a two-tiered education system in this country. Upper- and middle-class families can choose better schools for their kids and lower-income families cannot. 

They do not have an equal opportunity. People don't like to hear this, but it is the truth.

My husband and I lead a small scholarship program that gives some of these children a chance to seek a better education. But we can only meet a small fraction of the demand.

So I'd like to throw down this challenge to all those who are so excited about having a big brawl on both sides of an affirmative action ballot initiative: Get off your backside and do something about the cause rather than the symptoms of affirmative action programs.",,status,,2016-11-24 10:47:36,249,66,21,207,19,5,9,0,9

One horrifying anecdote about immigration -- I picked a pro bono case for my law firm, where I work. I chose an uncontested divorce case -- an Indian woman living in Harlem in public housing with her daughter (illegitimate). As it turns out, the woman was born in India and came to the US through a fraudulent green card marriage. Once she got her, she immediately divorced the guy.

She shortly afterward entered into another fraudulent green card marriage. When the guy (another Indian in the country illegally) started to beat her, she refused to sign his citizenship application papers. His parents, who also appear to be in the country illegally, live in a house in Philadelphia. She says she is ostracized in her community because she refused to sign his papers.

Jackson was ordered into valet service of a Brit officer, but angrily refused to shine the officer's boots (or do anything for that matter).The officer slashed Jackson with his saber, leaving a long and visible scar across his face for life. 
Jackson's mother volunteered as a nurse to Americans taken prisoner by the Brits & jammed into ""hulks"" (prison ships) in Charleston Harbor.
These fetid places of horror were breeding cultures for typhus and other diseases. (10k+ patriots died in prison hulks off NY's East River.)

Trump is a weak candidate with a low ceiling and no base who we just happen to be burning through untold millions of dollars to try to stop.

The lesson of #Brussels is clear. If we don't want our own peaceful Muslims blowing up airports, we must rein in Trump's divisive rhetoric.

Muslims HAVE to live in our countries. That's a non negotiable. So we just nuke their ancestral homelands until they stop radicalizing, duh!

George Washington is no doubt rolling in his grave at the prospect that the US might stop involving itself in internecine Mid East wars.

Trump is a madman. If we withdraw from NATO, then how is Turkey going to get us involved in a nuclear exchange with Russia? Think!

I call the local police every day about the Twitter death threats I'm getting, but they do NOTHING. I suspect Trump paid them off.

I know TECHNICALLY Jesus instructed believers to fast in secret, but then how are you supposed to use your fast for political point-scoring?

But then, years and years later they get slightly promoted, promoted, promoted. The private sector has passed them by and all of a sudden these people are negotiating the lives of you and your children, your families, and I tell you there's a tremendous amount of difference.""",Trump Has Been Thinking About Nuclear Proliferation Since 1987,link,http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_spectator/2016/03/trump_s_nuclear_experience_advice_for_reagan_in_1987.html,2016-03-06 22:11:04,1235,148,170,1194,32,8,0,0,1

4 August 2010
Interviewer: Meg Whitman is in the studio. She is, I thought we were playing a commercial there, didn't know.  Yeah, I was just talking to her off the air. Commercial free until four o'clock, and we're going to start right into it. Welcome, how are you?

MW: Good, thank you for having me.

Illegal Immigration/Arizona Law/ Latino Outreach

Interviewer: Thank you for coming. Let's get right into this because we have limited time. You've run at least 30 billboards around the state, saying, in Spanish, unequivocally, no on the Arizona Law. And then there was this ad. Mando, play cut 2. This is a Spanish language ad against the Arizona bill.

[Spanish Ad Plays]

Interviewer: Alright you can stop it there. The translation is that she is the republican that opposes Arizona's Law. Now, on a conservative radio show, that ran at about 3 o'clock in the morning the other day, you said this on the Arizona Law.

[Meg: I'm running for governor of California, so I have to make a decision, does the Arizona law make sense for California. And I have said no. I don't think the Arizona law makes sense for California because we have a much bigger state with a much bigger geography. And I understand that immigration is a federal issue, but I would say the states have got to decide what is right for their state. So I would let the Arizona law stand for Arizona.]

Interviewer: The Arizona law should stand for Arizona, but in the Spanish language ad you said that you oppose the law. Which is it?

MW: So, I oppose the Arizona law, have from the beginning, and you know, Steve Poizner ran millions of dollars of campaign ads against me saying I supported Arizona.

Interviewer: So you oppose the Arizona Law? But in the clip that we just played you said you would let the Arizona law stand.

MW: So what I was asked was, the context for that, what I was asked was, what would be my recommendation to the judge who was deciding that day. And I said listen, given that the federal government has not secured the border, has not done their job, you have to come down on the side of states rights. And Arizona needs to be able to decide what they think is right for them.

Why Arizona Law is Wrong for California

Interviewer: But why is the Arizona law wrong for California? What's this about a bigger state with a bigger geography? This makes no sense.

MW: So my view is, I've got a better plan for California. And it is a much bigger state, you know, with many, with 400 different‚Ä¶

(Crosstalk)

Interviewer: But why wouldn't the Arizona law work because we have bigger geograohy?

MW: It's not the only reason.

Interviewer: But it's the reason you said in that interview. And it's the oppisite of what you said in the Spanish language commercial. You said clearly, no on the Arizona law, and you said clearly in English that you were fine with the Arizona law in Arizona.

MW: That's not true, that's not true. What I said is that states rights have to preside here, and that I didn't think it was right for the Federal Government to be telling Arizona what to do. And I think the Arizona law is wrong for California.

Interviewer: Why, why, why. Why can't we have local police calling the feds saying I've got an illegal alien here? What's wrong with that?

MW: So we, first of all, you know we, in real life we have to get things done, you have to do things that will actually work, and my view is, the three things that I want to do for California will work better than the Arizona law.

Interviewer: No, no, I want to know why it wouldn't work, all you're talking about is a cop calling the Feds, and its done all the time now‚Ä¶

(Crosstalk)

MW: Listen, you can see in Arizona, this has created tremendous divisiveness, you're going to be involved in law suites for many years

Interviewer: So what? It has also led to many illegal's leaving, many illegal's have left Arizona already anticipating this law. It's a wonderful idea, it's got a 70% approval rate in Arizona.

MW: And you're also going to see, I think, tremendous lawsuits on this, so why don't we do stuff that we know will work.

Interviewer: Just because there's opposition doesn't mean you don't do something. There's always going to be lawsuits if you try to do something over illegal immigration.

(Crosstalk)

Interviewer: I know, you're going to give us you're three point plan, let me just point out this before you do, you were against sanctuary cities.

MW: Correct.

Interviewer: You know the judge let that stand in Arizona?

MW: I do. And I actually think that was a good part of the Arizona law. But what I think is, clearly illegal immigration is a problem, in California and in the country.

Illegal Immigration/ Federal Government

Interviewer: But you don't want Arizona to do it's own thing to stop it. The federal government has done nothing for the last ten years. And there's no sign that they're going to do anything anytime soon. So now states want to do their own thing. So if California pass a 1070, you would not sign it as governor? Is that what you're saying?

MW: That's correct. I have said that. I said that in the debate with Steve Poizner as plain as day.

Interviewer: So you don't think the police‚Ä¶

(Crosstalk)

Interviewer: So you don't think that the police should be able to call into the feds and say, ""I've got an illegal alien here, he needs to be deported?"" The cops can't do that?

MW: My view is that this is not the right thing for California.

Interviewer: But why cant a cop do that? Why can't the police‚Ä¶I have memorized your three point plan, and one of the other points is the E-Verify plan.

MW: Correct.

Interviewer: And the other part of your plan was, well going at sanctuary cities which we just talked about before, more border protection.

MW: Correct.

Interviewer: These are two things that the Federal Government does that they're not doing, and you agree with that, so why couldn't California have a 1070 law which would help with those things. Drive illegal's from the state because the federal government isn't doing it.

MW: So my plan, I think, does a better job of having illegal immigrants leave the state.

Interviewer: But it counts on the federal government. Do you see the problem?

MW: Well, guess what?  Immigration is a federal issue, we have to count‚Ä¶

(Crosstalk)

Interviewer: The federal government is not doing the job.

MW: I agree.

Interviewer: How are you going to make that change?

MW: The next governor of California has to go to Washington DC, has to argue for better border control, has to argue for more resources, I will send the national guard to the border, 

Interviewer: We heard this from Schwarzenegger, wait a second, nobody wants arguments, people want action. At least Jan Brewner and the Arizona Legislature took some action.

MW: Did you see what Jan Brewer said yesterday? She said, ""I'm not sure this Arizona law is going to work.""

Interviewer: You mean what's left of it? No, it's not going to work now.

MW: No, from the beginning.

Interviewer: From the beginning? Well she signed the law, and why wouldn't it work? All it is about is cops making phone calls, the feds come and take the illegal alien away. It's not complicated, there's nothing mystical about it, it's very simple, plus it's a great deterrent.  It tells illegal's, ""You're not welcome here."" And that I think is what's most important.

Illegal Immigration/ E-Verify/ Federal Government

MW: So you know the best deterrent? Is holding employers accountable for only hiring verified workers. Do you know why most people come here?

Interviewer: But you said E-Verify doesn't work.

MW: Let me very clear on what I've said here.  What I've said is that E-Verify is in existence many companies use it, but it does have a false negative and a false positive rate. Before we hold employers accountable, we have to make sure that the system will work, because if we‚Ä¶

Interviewer: What if the feds never fix the system? You think Obama‚Ä¶ the federal government is not dealing with this issue, that's why Arizona did what it did. You're plan is counting on them to work this out.  You say you're going to go to Washington and straighten them out? Really? If Obama's president the next six years, he's not going to do anything. So the first 6 years of your administration, you're not going to do anything because they didn't do anything?

MW: No, that's not true.

Interviewer: So what are you going to do about employer sanctions, if their E-Verify system is still broken?

MW: So put the foot on the other shoe for a just a second here. You're a small businessperson, you want to do the right thing, E-Verify has a 10 % false positive, false negative rate. So you hire somebody‚Ä¶

Interviewer: Only 10%?

MW: It's only 10%.

E-Verify

Interviewer: Well jeeze, 90%'s pretty good, why don't we go use it?

MW: I would argue that we should use it, but we've got to make it better. Because think about it‚Ä¶

Interviewer: But at 90%, maybe that's as good as your ever going to get it, considering all the fraud out there. 90% is pretty, you would not implement sanctions with a 90% federal approval rate?

MW: So let me tell you what, I have talked to many small businesses, I don't know how many small businesses you have talked to‚Ä¶

Interviewer: With all due respect Meg, I asked you a question. If we have a 90% success rate with E-Verify‚Ä¶

MW: It needs to be better. It needs to be better

Interviewer: Really? You wouldn't implement state sanctions? So you're going to go for perfect?

MW: No, but I'm going to go for better than we have today.

Interviewer: What is it? 91%, 93.6%?

MW: I don't know what the right exact number here is.

Interviewer: Well, wait a second. We have a narrow focus here, it's between 90 and 100. I mean you're the one, you put it in your campaign literature that you were going to set up this economic  fence and I always said what the heck is an economic fence. And your literature says that you we are going to go and put sanctions on employers and then all of a sudden, well we don't like the E-Verify system and we're not going to implement it.

MW: So that's not a fair characterization of my point of view, it really is not. What I've said and I've said it on your show, I went back and looked on the transcript.

Interviewer: Sure, we replayed your tapes. You were quite definitive on our show

MW: What I said was, we have to get the E-Verify system up to par and then we will hold employers accountable. That's what I said on your show

(Crosstalk)

Interviewer:  But that's vague and you don't give us  a number so we don't know when you'll ever implement your employer sanction system. We've been jokingly calling you NutMeg, but that really is out there honestly. And that's just asking for too much. That's asking for the impossible.

MW: I disagree with you. I have to say I disagree with you.

 (Crosstalk)

695526053890545_839967259446423,"If conservatives had listened to me, we might not need TRUMP - 

Joining me now, author, columnist Ann Coulter. Between that and Orgy Island, they've got problems!

ANN COULTER, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST: Ethical questions with the Clintons?

HANNITY: Shocking!

(LAUGHTER)

COULTER: No, I think she'll have a lot of ethical questions. I mean, her main problem, it seems to me, besides the whole everything about the Clintons, is that she's not a very likable person. She was the odds-on favorite the last time. And oops, the Democrats ran off with a new trophy wife, Barack Obama. I think what is more important for a Republican victory is whom the Republicans choose.

HANNITY: Who would you like them to choose?

COULTER: Not Jeb Bush, along with most voters. I'm sort of -- I hope the Wall Street crowd doesn't watch your show because, boy, they're going to be wasting a lot of money on Jeb Bush.

HANNITY: You don't think he'll win?

COULTER: He is polling below Donald Trump in New Hampshire. And usually, this far out the, the polls don't mean that much because it's just a matter of name recognition. In fact, a few years ago, I went through my column where people were polling 18 months before the election, and it was all names that were never even in the top 10 because what was it? It was name recognition.

I don't think you can argue that Jeb Bush does not have name recognition. So the fact that he's polling -- he has higher unfavorables and far more than Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire. His unfavorables are about 50 percent, his favorables in the 30s. Hillary, and again, not a likable person, but...

HANNITY: Who do you like?

COULTER: ... it is also the case...

HANNITY: Who do you like?

COULTER: ... that only seven percent of Americans -- and this has been true -- I mean, going back to 2006, when the last Bush, thus the name recognition, tried to foist amnesty on the country, Americans keep telling pollsters they don't want amnesty. They voted out Eric Cantor, as I wrote in my column this week. How many ways -- what do we have to do to convince politicians we don't want amnesty? Make it a host on ""The View""? We can't get them to do what they said they were going to do!

And as I said in my column, every one of these guys, including Mitch McConnell and all the establishment Republicans, even Lamar Alexander said, Vote for us Republicans and we will block Obama's executive amnesty. Well...

HANNITY: A court did temporarily...

COULTER: Yes, well...

HANNITY: ... at least, but I think -- I think successfully.

COULTER: Yes, but I mean, most people don't even know. And I'm a little irritated with Fox News for this, with 10 hours of original programming every single day, that we haven't heard for two weeks Senate Democrats have been filibustering...

HANNITY: I talked about it.

COULTER: ... the GOP -- OK, well, thank you. I think we can talk about it maybe a tenth as much as ISIS because if you want to cover Muslim atrocities, you can do that from 1632 until the end of time 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

HANNITY: Well, we did the whole issue...

COULTER: There are always going to be Muslim atrocities! Whenever the media starts obsessing with ISIS, I think you're hiding something. And you're hiding something on the Democrats, who themselves, when they're running for office, say, Oh, no, of course I don't support Obama's executive amnesty. Now they're down there filibustering it! Do Americans even know that?

HANNITY: Three separate times. They're on vacation this week. They'll come back next week. Now here's the question -- 

COULTER: A lot of these, you know, alleged Republican spokesmen or news analysts, I guess I'll say, oh, no, well, Republicans can't do anything, they can't do anything, because it will shut down the government. It won't shut down the government. The government is fully funded. 

HANNITY: Agreed. 

COULTER: It will -- a few secretaries won't go to work at the Department of Homeland Security. And 90 percent of the employees there are essential personnel. They can't be let go. There's no risk. So I don't want to hear from these Republicans, oh, we can't. We gave you a majority. You said give us a majority, we will block executive amnesty. OK. You got it, Republicans. 

HANNITY: They have two constitutional powers. Power of the purse and also advise and consent. President wants a new attorney general. I would use both of those as the leverage that we gave them -- 

COULTER: And also, I mean, the House did pass a good bill. But I think we could use a little more explanation from Republicans. Look, even if you think we shouldn't be hounding illegal aliens to get them out of the country, I don't think most Americans even understand that what Obama's amnesty does is give them Social Security cards, give them work permits, and give every illegal alien $25,000 from the U.S. treasury. Did Americans sign up for that? And why aren't Republicans talking about that? 

I mean, the media is in the tank for amnesty true, but the media's in the tank for global warming. The media was in the tank for, you know, indicting the officer in Ferguson. The media is in the tank for that mattress girl up at Columbia. It doesn't work in any of those cases. Why? Because the public hates the media. So how about Republicans get on TV and attack the media and tell them what's really going on with this executive amnesty? 

HANNITY: That's why you're here. Thank you.",,status,,2016-02-26 13:00:00,413,36,30,396,13,0,4,0,0

Cruz on Megyn Kelly, Wednesday, Feb 10:

CRUZ: Well, Megyn, let's be clear on health care. Even now as a candidate, Donald says we need to have full-on socialized medicine. In the Republican debates, he stood up and said, we ought to have socialized medicine like Canada and Scotland and at the very last debate, he said if you a Republican voters don't support socialized medicine, then you are heartless and you want to let people die in the streets. You know, what we hear that kind of rhetoric all the time from Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, I don't think Republican voters are interested in hearing a Republican candidate saying, they are heartless if they don't want the government taking over medicine. And so, there's a real choice on healthcare, if you want to see Bernie Sander's style socialize medicine, Donald Trump is your guy. In his own words he describes himself as very, very liberal on health care. 

What Trump actually said at the debates about health care -- IN FULL:

FIRST DEBATE:

BAIER: Gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government.

Mr. Trump, ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster.

TRUMP: A complete disaster, yes.

BAIER: Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced.

TRUMP: Correct.

BAIER: Now, 15 years ago, uncalled yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then and why aren't you for it now?

TRUMP: As far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here.

What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid.

You know why?

Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage.

But they have total control of the politicians. They're making a fortune. Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have‚Ä¶

(BUZZER NOISE)

TRUMP: ‚Äî yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can't take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system.

(CROSSTALK)

RAND PAUL: I've got a news flash‚Ä¶

BAIER: All right, now, hold on, Senator Paul‚Ä¶

PAUL: News flash, the Republican Party's been fighting against a single-payer system for a decade. So I think you're on the wrong side of this if you're still arguing for a single-payer system.

TRUMP: I'm not ‚Äî I'm not are ‚Äî I don't think you heard me. You're having a hard time tonight.

********* 

LAST DEBATE 

HAM: In the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton has criticized Bernie Sanders' plan for single payer government health care, noting it would require big, across the board tax increases for Americans. In doing so, she's doubling down on Obamacare, despite its persistent unpopularity.

Mr. Trump, you have said you want to appeal Obamacare. You have also said, quote, ""Everybody's got to be covered,"" adding, quote, ""The government's going to pay for it."" Are you closer to Bernie Sanders' vision for health care than Hillary Clinton's?

TRUMP: I don't think I am. I think I'm closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare.

(APPLAUSE)

TRUMP: We're going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better. And there are so many examples of it. And I will tell you, part of the reason we have some people laughing, because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.

I am self-funded. The only one they're not taking care of is me. We have our lines around each state. The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare. The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health. We are going to end that.

We're going to take out the artificial boundaries, the artificial lines. We're going to get a plan where people compete, free enterprise. They compete. So much better.

(APPLAUSE)

TRUMP: In addition to that, you have the health care savings plans, which are excellent. What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don't want that to happen. We're going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we're going to take care of those people. And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree...

(BELL RINGS)

... you're not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country.

February 7, 2016, 1:15 AM
FULL CHRISTIE-RUBIO EXCHANGE AT NH DEBATE - WOW! - 

ABC'S DAVID MUIR: Senator Rubio. I want to stay on the issue of readiness to be president and experience and questions about you being a first-term senator.

Governor Christie warning voters here in New Hampshire against voting for another first-term senator as America did with Barack Obama in 2008. Arguing that you are, quote, "" not ready to be president of the United States.""

And Senator Santorum, who we all know, dropped out of the race and endorsed you, had a hard time when asked on national television, listing your accomplishments as senator. Tonight, what are your accomplishments in the Senate that demonstrate you are ready to be president of the United States?

RUBIO: Well, let me say, from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse, to bringing accountability to the V.A., to the Girls Count Act, to sanctioning groups, I'm proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that, in the Florida legislature.

I will say, if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden. He's been around 1,000 years. He's passed hundreds of bills and I don't think any of us believe Joe Biden should be president of the United States.

And let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.

That's why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I'm president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world.

MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: I do want to ask Governor Christie, Governor Christie, you said fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me when it comes to electing a first-term senator. You heard Senator Rubio make the case that he does have the experience. Your response?

CHRISTIE: Sure. First, let's remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up, they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning, when I wake up, I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me?

It's a different experience, it's a much different experience. And the fact is, Marco, you shouldn't compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldn't say that that's what we're doing. Here is exactly what we're doing.

You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven't.

(APPLAUSE)

And the fact is ‚Äî the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you weren't even there to vote for it. That's not leadership, that's truancy.

(APPLAUSE)

And the fact is that what we need to do ‚Äî what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don't come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.

I like Marco Rubio, and he's a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. We've watched it happen, everybody. For the last seven years, the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again.

RUBIO: If I may respond to that.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio?

RUBIO: Well, I think the experience is not just what you did, but how it worked out. Under Chris Christie's governorship of New Jersey, they've been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem, we don't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state.

But I would add this. Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America. And when I'm elected president, this will become once again, the single greatest nation in the history of the world, not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon us.

MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to bring in Governor Bush on this, because you...

CHRISTIE: Hold on one second.

MUIR: ... have made this...

CHRISTIE: Excuse me...

MUIR: If you'd like to respond to economic...

CHRISTIE: I think he mentioned me and my record in there, so I think I get a chance to respond. You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington, D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him.

(APPLAUSE)

See Marco ‚Äî Marco, the thing is this. When you're president of the United States, when you're a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your state's history hits you, they expect you to rebuild their state, which is what I've done.

None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. It's a fine job, I'm glad you ran for it, but it does not prepare you for president of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: Senator Rubio?

RUBIO: Chris ‚Äî Chris, your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didn't even want to go back. They had to shame you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts.

Here's the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he's doing.

CHRISTIE: There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.

RUBIO: Well, that's the ‚Äî that's the reason why this campaign is so important. Because I think this notion ‚Äî I think this is an important point. We have to understand what we're going through here. We are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing. He knows what he is doing. That's why he's done the things he's done.

That's why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that he's done to America is deliberate. This is a president that's trying to redefine this country. That's why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation, as a people. Our future is at stake.

This election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century, and if we elect someone like Barack Obama, a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders or anyone like that, our children are going to be the first Americans to inherit a diminishes country. That will not happen if I'm elected.

MUIR: Governor Christie, we will ‚Äî we will...

ABC'S DAVID MUIR: Senator Rubio. I want to stay on the issue of readiness to be president and experience and questions about you being a first-term senator.

Governor Christie warning voters here in New Hampshire against voting for another first-term senator as America did with Barack Obama in 2008. Arguing that you are, quote, "" not ready to be president of the United States.""

And Senator Santorum, who we all know, dropped out of the race and endorsed you, had a hard time when asked on national television, listing your accomplishments as senator. Tonight, what are your accomplishments in the Senate that demonstrate you are ready to be president of the United States?

RUBIO: Well, let me say, from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse, to bringing accountability to the V.A., to the Girls Count Act, to sanctioning groups, I'm proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that, in the Florida legislature.

I will say, if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden. He's been around 1,000 years. He's passed hundreds of bills and I don't think any of us believe Joe Biden should be president of the United States.

And let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.

That's why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I'm president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world.

MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: I do want to ask Governor Christie, Governor Christie, you said fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me when it comes to electing a first-term senator. You heard Senator Rubio make the case that he does have the experience. Your response?

CHRISTIE: Sure. First, let's remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up, they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning, when I wake up, I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me?

It's a different experience, it's a much different experience. And the fact is, Marco, you shouldn't compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldn't say that that's what we're doing. Here is exactly what we're doing.

You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven't.

(APPLAUSE)

And the fact is ‚Äî the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you weren't even there to vote for it. That's not leadership, that's truancy.

(APPLAUSE)

And the fact is that what we need to do ‚Äî what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don't come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.

I like Marco Rubio, and he's a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. We've watched it happen, everybody. For the last seven years, the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again.

RUBIO: If I may respond to that.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio?

RUBIO: Well, I think the experience is not just what you did, but how it worked out. Under Chris Christie's governorship of New Jersey, they've been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem, we don't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state.

But I would add this. Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America. And when I'm elected president, this will become once again, the single greatest nation in the history of the world, not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon us.

MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to bring in Governor Bush on this, because you...

CHRISTIE: Hold on one second.

MUIR: ... have made this...

CHRISTIE: Excuse me...

MUIR: If you'd like to respond to economic...

CHRISTIE: I think he mentioned me and my record in there, so I think I get a chance to respond. You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington, D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him.

(APPLAUSE)

See Marco ‚Äî Marco, the thing is this. When you're president of the United States, when you're a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your state's history hits you, they expect you to rebuild their state, which is what I've done.

None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. It's a fine job, I'm glad you ran for it, but it does not prepare you for president of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

MUIR: Senator Rubio?

RUBIO: Chris ‚Äî Chris, your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didn't even want to go back. They had to shame you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts.

Here's the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he's doing.

CHRISTIE: There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.

RUBIO: Well, that's the ‚Äî that's the reason why this campaign is so important. Because I think this notion ‚Äî I think this is an important point. We have to understand what we're going through here. We are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing. He knows what he is doing. That's why he's done the things he's done.

That's why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that he's done to America is deliberate. This is a president that's trying to redefine this country. That's why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation, as a people. Our future is at stake.

This election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century, and if we elect someone like Barack Obama, a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders or anyone like that, our children are going to be the first Americans to inherit a diminishes country. That will not happen if I'm elected.

MUIR: Governor Christie, we will ‚Äî we will...

And by the way, the people doing the scolding? They're the ones who've been advocating for open borders, and nation-building in countries whose populations hate us, and trade deals that eliminated jobs while enriching their donors, all while implicitly mocking the base for its worries about abortion and gay marriage and the pace of demographic change. Now they're telling their voters to shut up and obey, and if they don't, they're liberal.

""On immigration policy, party elders were caught completely by surprise. Even canny operators like Ted Cruz didn't appreciate the depth of voter anger on the subject. And why would they? If you live in an affluent ZIP code, it's hard to see a downside to mass low-wage immigration. Your kids don't go to public school. You don't take the bus or use the emergency room for health care. No immigrant is competing for your job. (The day Hondurans start getting hired as green energy lobbyists is the day my neighbors become nativists.)

Here is Trump's full answer to the Tea Party question in that interview with Larry King Live, April 18, 2009:

KING: What do you make of these tea party protests about bailouts and federal spending being held all over the country?

TRUMP: Well, they're saying the taxes are too high, the spending is too high, the amount of money that's going out all over the world. We're fighting wars in Iraq and yet we're not taking care of New Orleans.

We're doing things that are just insane.

I mean, we have a trillion dollars into Iraq. And I guarantee the day we leave, within a day, within 24 hours, it's going to be riots in the street. It's -- it's terrible. It's terrible.

So we're spending all of this money outside of this country. And, you know, just as an example, you asked me about the pilots -- the pirates. It's such a simple -- we have destroyers going all over the place. They can handle their own problem just by having sharpshooters. The money that we spend on protecting the world is just absolutely ridiculous. We have to protect ourselves.

Now, you have another problem. When the economy starts getting better, you will have an OPEC problem. They'll just start raising the price of oil again and destroy the economy, because I happen to think, yes, the banks and, yes, the derivatives and, yes, all of the crazy financial instruments that were conjured up for people to make money and it turned out to be false money, but I also happen to think that $150 oil destroyed the world economically.

And as soon as the world comes back, OPEC will raise its ugly head and destroy it again. So somebody better sit -- and I hope it's our president -- somebody better sit down with OPEC right now and say, ""Listen, we're going to straighten this mess out, but you're not going to destroy it for us again.""

KING: But you're not going to march with the tea party?

TRUMP: I don't march with the tea party. But I'll tell you what, they have a good point, because when you see the kind of money that this country is -- to use a horrible expression, Larry, I know you've never heard this -- but that this country is pissing away, I can understand where they're coming from.",,status,,2016-01-20 23:29:14,704,229,179,704,0,0,0,0,0

That was his conclusion. ...

Donald J. Trump has raised questions about whether Senator Ted Cruz is eligible to be president because he was born in Canada, even though his mother was an American citizen.

In September, Mr. Trump did weigh in about Mr. Cruz's eligibility to be president. Though he did not say precisely what Mr. Cruz recalled, he did suggest that the citizenship question was a non-issue.

""I hear it was checked out by every attorney and every which way, and I understand Ted is in fine shape,"" Mr. Trump told ABC News.

The GOP leaders of South Carolina - who helped install Lindsay Graham - are engaged in a campaign of radical disenfranchisement.  They are pushing to outnumber their own voting base with innumerable new voters from the third world.  They are nullifying the electoral impact of South Carolina Republicans -- whose families carved this country out of the wilderness, who have family Bibles going back ten generations in America, who fought in every war since the revolution -- and replacing them, steadily, with newcomers from the non-western world.  By any rational definition, such behavior would be considered pathological.  If you represent rural, conservative South Carolina families -- the nicest, hardest working, most sincere and down to earth people in the world  -- and all you want to do is bring in 10X, 100X as many people from the third world to replace them - then you are basically engaged in open hostilities against your own base.

Over the last few decades, economists and psychologists have quietly documented the many ways in which a person's IQ matters.  
But, research suggests that a nation's IQ matters so much more.
-""high-IQ countries tend to have less corruption,  
-""high-IQ people tend to cooperate with each other more than low-IQ people,
-""your own productivity tends to increase when you work around people who have high IQs,
-""your own productivity increases when your co-workers are skilled""

What Singer and his Wall Street pals want is a lap dog on a financial leash to lock in their 15% hedge fund tax rate, and he's found him. Rubio, with his long history of relying on sugar daddies to bail him out of the mismanagement of his personal finances, has found a new and much richer one. A consumate insider seeks to crown the king. It will be amusing to see if the crown prince attracts the adoring crowds searching for their ""outsider"".

Washington Post poll of GOP activists, July 1, 1979 - 

Reagan won the poll, from which the Post also picked this ""unscientific sampling of opinions ."" Bold thinkers complained Reagan was too old and praised Bush as a ""gentleman."" But it's striking how much the Reagan supporters sounded like Trumpians today, saying he was ""our country's last chance"" and that they would support no other.

Ronald Reagan's election to the presidency in 1980 appears to be our country's last chance to avert economic disaster at home and a subservient posture in our foreign relations. Our way of life and our basic moral and economic values will be at stake in 1980.
Reese H. Taylor Jr. [Nevada]""

John Connally is the one man who can beat Teddy and Jimmy.
Willard O. Forbes [Virginia]""

I think Reagan-Connally ticket would be very hard to beat. I think they would turn this country around and we would be the No.1 country in the world.
Mary M. Jackson [Texas]""

Reagan: too old. My problem is not with the governor but with some of his followers who are ideological purists, rule-or-ruin types for whom no one [Goldwater, Bill Buckley, whomever] is quite conservative enough....Bush: The question is: Can a gentleman still be elected president? After the Carter debacle, I think the country's ready for one. Bush is the campaign's real sleeper.
Roger P. Cambell [Pennsylvania]""

I am totally committed to Ronald Reagan and would probably not actively work for the Republican nominee if it is not Reagan.
E.M. Gingrich [California]""

I am ashamed of myself for being so pessimistic about the economic political situtation of our nation. A national disaster in the form of a war or depression is all I see that can turn the direction toward socialism that our government is reaching.
C.E. Peterson [Utah]""

We need to cut out all foreign aid, or better yet start asking for it.
Sam M. Laughlin [New Mexico]""

I have placed Bob Dole as my first choice as I know him well and feel he would become an excellent president. However, he has an image problem from the last election when Ford handed him a hatchet while he played the high road.
J.Nick Gray [Missouri]""

We need someone who can place the proper blame on Carter without sounding like Bob Dole.
Robert B. French [Alabama]""

This is an exciting and desperate time to be a Republican. It is exciting because for the first time in over 30 years we [Republicans] have an excellent chance of defeating an incumbent president. It is desperate because we must win. Jimmy Carter has as much idea of how to be president as I do of being an astronaut.
Bryan Wagner [Louisiana]""

The old ideologic rift in the Republican Party is now of little importance. All the candidates will speak almost in a single voice. Issues will count for little. Perceptions of personality will count for everything. That's why I think Connally will win -- and win big. What he has said or done in the past will be unimportant.
Ray L. Garland [Virginia]""

John Connally, as a presidential candidate, will only open old GOP wounds. The media would love to jab away and rehash the old news headlines.
Doris M. Russell [Maine]""

The fact that many of we ""New Right"" conservatives are supporting Phil Crane can in no way be interpreted as an anti-Reagan sentiment. I would still be overjoyed to see Reagan take it.
Steven Antosh [Oklahoma]""

I like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's remark on being called a reactionary: ""There is a lot to react against."" The people are reacting against inflation, government regulations, the energy crisis [I believe it's real, but most people don't], and how far we can trust the Soviets with a SALT treaty. John F. Kemp, Gen. Haig or Crane could be the sleeper of 1980.
Jack C. Hunter [Ohio]""

The greatest thing that could happen to this country is not election of a president, but a Congress that would pass laws abolishing about 1,000,000 bureaucratic jobs in Washington. It wouldn't matter too much who is president if you had the right kind of Congress.
H.E. Richardson [Kentucky]""

The greatest hope for the survival of this nation may rest in the election of Ronald Reagan as president. To think otherwise is economic idiocy.
George O. Miles [Kansas]""

All questions concerning political parties have little meaning because there is so much variation in the beliefs and actions of political leaders. This is especially so in the GOP.
John A. Wilkinson [North Carolina]""

I believe that the nominating of Ronald Reagan is the Republican Party's last chance. More importantly, the election of the former California governor is our last chance as a nation of strength and individual freedom.
Steve Schalk [New Mexico]""

I truly believe a Howard Baker-Jack Kemp ticket to be unbeatable at this time.
Del Case [Minnesota]""

Howard Baker would be one of the weaker candidates because of his weak leadership and his vote on the Panama Canal treaty.
George L. Clardy [Georgia]""

Brock is doing a good job in rebuilding the party. Ford and Reagan are too old to run.

[Email to Talk Radio's Lars Larson today] 

Lars,

I am not a book critic, however, I do read books, critically. I finished off Ann Coulter's 'Adios, America' in quick order. Wait just a minute, I read the text, but where have I been for the last 50 years--on another planet?

For all those years, I have been involved in the politics of our Republic in one form or another, and felt I was well informed as to the individual issues. After giving due consideration to the authors' work, I felt disappointed---in my efforts, not hers.

It was then I went back to the book and began to take each reference, and 'read' it. That effort was laborious, and time consuming, but I wound up with the satisfaction that I have a very good understanding what the author was relating---which turns my concepts upside down.

I finished off those efforts better informed, but my immediate future will be spent on the formation of a whole new understanding of the ills of, not only my Party, but our political system in total.

695526053890545_717980728311744,"LOOK AT STEPHANOPOULOS'S BIRTH CONTROL QUESTION AT 2012 GOP DEBATE AND ASK YOURSELF IF HE IS AN EVEN-HANDED MODERATOR -

Jan 7, 2012 New Hampshire GOP primary debate (ABC/Yahoo!/WMUR)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Back in Manchester. Governor Romney, I want to go straight to you.

Senator Santorum has been very clear in his belief that the Supreme Court was wrong when it decided that a right to privacy was embedded in the Constitution. And following from that, he believes that states have the right to ban contraception. Now I should add that he said he's not recommending that states do that...

SANTORUM: No, I said -- let's be clear.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. I'm giving you your due...

SANTORUM: I'm talking about -- we're talking about the 10th Amendment and the right of states to act.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But I do want to get to that core question.

SANTORUM: OK.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, do you believe that states have the right to ban contraception? Or is that trumped by a constitutional right to privacy?

ROMNEY: George, this is an unusual topic that you're raising. States have a right to ban contraception? I can't imagine a state banning contraception. I can't imagine the circumstances where a state would want to do so, and if I were a governor of a state or...

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the Supreme Court has ruled --

(CROSSTALK)

ROMNEY: ... or a -- or a legislature of a state -- I would totally and completely oppose any effort to ban contraception. So you're asking -- given the fact that there's no state that wants to do so, and I don't know of any candidate that wants to do so, you're asking could it constitutionally be done? We can ask our constitutionalist here.

(LAUGHTER)

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm sure Congressman Paul...

(CROSSTALK)

ROMNEY: OK, come on -- come on back...

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: ... asking you, do you believe that states have that right or not? ROMNEY: George, I -- I don't know whether a state has a right to ban contraception. No state wants to. I mean, the idea of you putting forward things that states might want to do that no -- no state wants to do and asking me whether they could do it or not is kind of a silly thing, I think.

(APPLAUSE)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Hold on a second. Governor, you went to Harvard Law School. You know very well this is based on...

ROMNEY: Has the Supreme Court -- has the Supreme Court decided that states do not have the right to provide contraception? I...

STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, they have. In 1965, Griswold v. Connecticut.

ROMNEY: The -- I believe in the -- that the law of the land is as spoken by the Supreme Court, and that if we disagree with the Supreme Court -- and occasionally I do -- then we have a process under the Constitution to change that decision. And it's -- it's known as the amendment process.

And -- and where we have -- for instance, right now we're having issues that relate to same-sex marriage. My view is, we should have a federal amendment of the Constitution defining marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman. But I know of -- of no reason to talk about contraception in this regard.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But you've got the Supreme Court decision finding a right to privacy in the Constitution.

ROMNEY: I don't believe they decided that correctly. In my view, Roe v. Wade was improperly decided. It was based upon that same principle. And in my view, if we had justices like Roberts, Alito, Thomas, and Scalia, and more justices like that, they might well decide to return this issue to states as opposed to saying it's in the federal Constitution.

And by the way, if the people say it should be in the federal Constitution, then instead of having unelected judges stuff it in there when it's not there, we should allow the people to express their own views through amendment and add it to the Constitution. But this idea that justice...

STEPHANOPOULOS: But should that be done in this case?

ROMNEY: Pardon?

STEPHANOPOULOS: Should that be done in this case?

ROMNEY: Should this be done in the case -- this case to allow states to ban contraception? No. States don't want to ban contraception. So why would we try and put it in the Constitution?

With regards to gay marriage, I've told you, that's when I would amend the Constitution. Contraception, it's working just fine, just leave it alone.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE) STEPHANOPOULOS: I understand that. But you've given two answers to the question. Do you believe that the Supreme Court should overturn it or not?

ROMNEY: Do I believe the Supreme Court should overturn...

(SOMEONE IN AUDIENCE YELLING)

ROMNEY: Do I believe the Supreme Court should overturn Roe v. Wade? Yes, I do. PAUL: He mentioned my name.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Go ahead then.

PAUL: I didn't know whether I got time when it was favorable or not. But thank you. No, I think the Fourth Amendment is very clear. It is explicit in our privacy. You can't go into anybody's house and look at what they have or their papers or any private things without a search warrant.

This is why the Patriot Act is wrong, because you have a right of privacy by the Fourth Amendment. As far as selling contraceptives, the Interstate Commerce Clause protects this because the Interstate Commerce Clause was originally written not to impede trade between the states, but it was written to facilitate trade between the states. So if it's not illegal to import birth control pills from one state to the next, it would be legal to sell birth control pills in that state.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Santorum?

SANTORUM: What's the question?

(LAUGHTER)

STEPHANOPOULOS: On the right to privacy and the response to Congressman Paul.

SANTORUM: Well, Congressman Paul is talking about privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment, which I agree with him in, I don't necessarily agree that the Patriot Act violates that. But I do agree with -- obviously we have a right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment. But that's not what the Griswold decision nor the Roe v. Wade decision were about.

They created through a penumbra of rights a new right to privacy that was not in the Constitution. And what I've -- and that's, again, I sort of agree with Governor Romney's assessment -- legal assessment, it created a right through boot-strapping, through creating something that wasn't there. I believe it should be overturned.

I am for overturning Roe versus Wade. I do not believe that we have a right in this country, in the Constitution, to take a human life. I don't think that's -- I don't think our founders envisioned that. I don't think the writing of the Constitution anywhere enables that.

SAWYER: I want to turn now, if I can, from the Constitutional and the elevated here, to something closer to home and to maybe families sitting in their living rooms all across this country.

Yahoo! sends us questions, as you know. We have them from real viewers. And I'd like to post one, because it is about gay marriage. But at the level -- and I would really love to be able to ask you what you would say personally, sitting in your living rooms, to the people who ask questions like this.

This is from Phil in Virginia. ""Given that you oppose gay marriage, what do you want gay people to do who want to form loving, committed, long-term relationships? What is your solution?"" And, Speaker Gingrich?

GINGRICH: Well, I think what I would say is that we want to make it possible to have those things that are most intimately human between friends occur. For example, you're in a hospital. If there are visitation hours, should you be allowed to stay there? There ought to be ways to designate that.

You want to have somebody in your will. There ought to be ways to designate that. But it is a huge jump from being understanding and considerate and concerned, which we should be, to saying we therefore are going to institute the sacrament of marriage as though it has no basis.

The sacrament of marriage was based on a man and woman, has been for 3,000 years. Is at the core of our civilization. And it's something worth protecting and upholding. And I think protecting and upholding that doesn't mean you have to go out and make life miserable for others, but it does mean you make a distinction between a historic sacrament of enormous importance in our civilization and simply deciding it applies everywhere and it's just a civil right.

It's not. It is a part of how we define ourselves. And I think that a marriage between a man and a woman is part of that definition.

SAWYER: Governor Huntsman, you've talked about civil unions. How do you disagree with the others on this stage?

HUNTSMAN: Well, personally, I think civil unions are fair. I support them. I think there's such a thing as equality under the law.

I'm a married man. I've been married for 28 years. I have seven kids. Glad we're off the contraception discussion.

MSNBC POLICE BRUTALITY EXPERTS ARE INCREDIBLE -- NOT IN A GOOD WAY

April 29, 2015

It's beginning to look as if the Democratic Party can't whip African-Americans into an anti-white frenzy to turn out on Election Day, and then say, ""OK, thanks, guys! That's all we need."" 

How else do liberals explain the upsurge in racial unrest since Obama became president? Why would white racism -- their view -- latent for the previous 15 years, burst forth meteorically just as the country elected its first black president? 

Did we elect this bumbling incompetent, then suddenly remember that we're racists? 

I have an explanation! It's subtly alluded to in the title of my book, ""Mugged: Racial Demagoguery From the Seventies to Obama."" What's theirs? 

I've tried looking on Salon, which is like a liberal website from IFC's ""Portlandia"" (typical headline: ""Smashing police cars is a legitimate political strategy""), but Salon shows no interest in exploring why white racism has suddenly exploded under Obama. 

MSNBC, having been thoroughly embarrassed with the Michael-Brown-was-shot-in-the-back-while-walking-home-from-his-cancer‚Äìresearch-internship narrative, has gone totally abstract with the actual cause of the Baltimore unrest. The network covers the riots like a sporting event, with Chris Hayes constantly jumping in to talk about how smart and disciplined and clean the activists are. 

Which reminds me, whatever happened to Lawrence O'Donnell's star witness to the Ferguson shooting, Tiffany Mitchell? 

You're all surely familiar with Dorian Johnson, Brown's ex-con co-conspirator in the cigar robbery, who invented the whole ""hands up, don't shoot"" fantasy. MSNBC played Dorian's version of the shooting a million times a day last summer: 

""The officer is out of the car now ... and as he got closer, he fired one more shot. That shot struck my friend in the back. (Big Mike) then stopped what he was doing and stopped to turn around, with his hands in (the) air, and started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and he was not -- and before he can get his last words out, the officer fired several more shots and my friend went down in the fetal position.""
