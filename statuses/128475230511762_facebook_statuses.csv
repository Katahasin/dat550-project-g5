I worry that the pervasive corruption that the Democrat party has inflicted on the American government and on American political society does not bode well for an honest election outcome. Having said that, I realized that the most corrupt part of this entire election is the media's successful effort to have us focus obsessively on the candidates, so as to obscure actual issues.

The two campaigns are driven by competing core visions of America: Globalism and patriotism. It is those ideas, not the two reprehensible candidates, that voters must address in the 2016 election.

Trump and his supporters are still singing as loudly and as strongly as they can, but the death-blow has already been dealt.

You see, it's become very apparent that the American media has been sitting on information that might have affected the outcome of the Republican primaries. Had the media been genuinely interested in reporting the news and/or in ensuring that each party offered its finest candidate to the American people, the stories of Trump's behavior towards women would have been in the news during the peak of the primary season.

Then, in the Fall season, those cherry-picked party candidates get to go head-to-head, giving voters a genuine ideological choice.

All he has to do is send out a tweet or take a knee to assure others that he hews to approved Progressive traditions.
