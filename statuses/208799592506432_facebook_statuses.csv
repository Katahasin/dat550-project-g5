Each week since has also seen demonstrations, culminating in those that broke out at airports across the country at the end of January to protest the president's new Muslim ban barring travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Mass protests are in large measure a bellwether of popular sentiment. They carry an implicit threat that politicians who defy the will of the people will be voted out, but that threat must be channeled strategically, or it will dissipate.

The Clinton campaign and its most strident defenders continue to point the finger at everyone but themselves for our country's current predicament. On the left, however, a general consensus has emerged: It was the campaign's own elitism, not the bigotry of the white working class, that led to Clinton's loss. Yes, bigotry played a tremendous role, but it was a bigotry driven by desperation and anger at a system that has left so many behind--and that Donald Trump expertly manipulated.

The emerging resistance must reach out not only to liberals but also working-class Trump supporters. We cannot afford to accept that roughly 62 million Trump supporters are irredeemably bigoted because, if we do, there is no hope. Culture and emotion come into the mix but our politics--the politics of the left and of the labor movement--are ultimately predicated on the belief that people are rational actors, that they act in what they believe to be their own best interest and that they can be swayed by rational argument. Therein lies one of our most basic but most important tasks.""","""Fighting Trumpism: where do we go from here?"" by Micah Landau",link,http://newpol.org/content/fighting-trumpism-where-do-we-go-here,2017-02-20 19:17:23,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0

These groups and individuals have backed Putin in the seizure of Crimea, his stealthy intervention in Ukraine, and his support for the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad (whom they also support). Is this simply the crude politics of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend""? Or is there some theoretical justification for their position? And if so, what is it?

Samir Amin, often seen as the leading theoretician of the Global South, has written a short book that answers that question—though the answer he provides is not only unsatisfying but disturbing.

The Voting Rights Act of 1964 made it illegal to discriminate against people on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It made it illegal for state officials to give literacy (or even Latin) tests only to African Americans as a prerequisite to register to vote. It ended racial discrimination in establishments that offered what was defined as a public accommodation. That is, white southerners like George Wallace insisted that a restaurant is a private business and so the owner should be welcome to discriminate in which customers he or she would serve. The Voting Rights Act begged to differ. If you're serving the public, it said, you are in some ways a public institution and you may not operate in a racist manner. Some members of the Libertarian wing of the Republican Party still hold the George Wallace position on restaurants, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).""",Juan Cole: Is MLK's Legacy Being Reversed,link,http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/juan-cole-is-mlks-legacy-being-reversed#.WH6sTV21gWY.facebook,2017-01-17 18:45:42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The King that urges the movement to ""negotiate, agitate, resist"" in the film is a far cry from the sanitized King of American history textbooks and traditional MLK Day parades.

By delivering this long-concealed King to the public, DuVernay has made a tremendous contribution not only to American cinema, but to the Black Lives Matter movement that is still gaining its footing. DuVernay's refusal to make Selma into a hagiography or a one-man show makes it one of the few honest portrayals of a movement that America has purposefully mis-remembered.

Unions have an interesting history in the black community, but the economic organizing that is playing out right now is incredibly exciting—especially when it intersects with prisons and police. People and groups working in prisons (like the Free Alabama Movement, the Free Mississippi Movement, [those working in] the Texas immigrant prisons, and the IWW in Missouri's prisons) are organizing and pushing for work strikes and doing an inside-outside strategy. I think a lot of people forget this, but oftentimes hunger strikes in prisons are coupled with work strikes as well.

The situation was aggravated by the financial crisis of 2008, which led to the reduction of credit for small and medium firms, many of which had to cease their operations given the cancellation of their lines of credit and their inability to engage in self-financing.

208799592506432_847527148633670,"The summer issue of New Politics is off the presses. Here is a letter from the co-editors of what the new issue includes, and the role of New Politics in the contemporary left.

http://newpol.org/content/editors-7

Before turning to the current issue, we want to say a word about the new role that New Politics is playing on the left. New Politics has always been a source of analysis of national and world politics from the point of view of ""socialism from below."" More recently, however, we've also become—as a print journal and as an online website—a locus for debate on the democratic left. Last issue we began and this issue we continue our series on ""The Left We Need,"" with articles by all together a dozen different left organizations. We recently featured on our website (newpol.org) a half-dozen articles on the Chicago election and several articles on the Sanders campaign.

New Politics also endorsed, some of its editorial board members attended and participated in, and we reported on the important Conference on the Future of Left/Independent Politics, collaborating with a dozen different political organizations involved in independent campaigns as well as in holding political office and using that office to advocate for progressive policies while also building social movements. We are proud to be taking on this new role and hope to expand it as we engage in discussion and debate with others on the left with the goal of building a larger radical left in the United States, one which is an expression of fights for social justice.

We turn in this issue to the latest explosive development of a social movement in the United States, the Black Lives Matter movement. Several Black and white authors, in articles as well as movie and book reviews, look at this new development and at accounts of earlier Black movements. Donna Murch, Raven Rakia, Kali Akuno, Francis Shor, Femi Agbabiaka, Gabriel Kilpatrick, Alan Stowers, Martin Oppenheimer, Linda Braune, Reginald Wilson, and Jamie Munro provide us with a variety of perspectives on the Black movements and particularly Black Lives Matter.

We also continue the series of articles on the ""Left We Need"" that began in the last issue, with articles by members of the Young Democratic Socialists and the Puerto Rican Party of the Working People (PPT).

Europe is also back on the agenda. Barry Finger looks at the Syriza party of Greece and its struggle with the Troika, while Jean Batou analyzes the struggle over Ukraine and Stéfanie Prezioso paints a picture of Europe and the growing far right. 

Yousef Khalil examines neoliberalism and the failures of the Arab Spring, while Riad Azar shows the authoritarian consequences of neoliberal austerity. While there is much written about China, the left produces little analysis of Taiwan, a subject taken up in this issue by Poe Yu-ze Wan. 

Additional book reviews include Johanna Brenner on the new edition of the socialist-feminist classic, Beyond the Fragments, Stephen R. Shalom on Murray Bookchin, Nathan Robinson on Rudolph Rocker's 1937 Nationalism and Culture, and Michael Löwy on the Frankfort School and the Jews. Finally, Kent Worchester, our reviewer of comics and graphic art, writes in his ""Words and Pictures"" column about Wonder Woman.

208799592506432_845199908866394,"""The fight for partnership rights originally gathered steam as a reaction against glaring injustices. Especially during the height of the AIDS epidemic, the trauma of a partner's sickness and death was compounded for thousands of gay men by having their hospital visits barred and being thrown out of apartments that were in their dead partners' names. We can only rejoice at the spread of protections that have safeguarded health insurance, housing rights, immigration rights, tax equality and more for people in same-sex relationships. In this sense, the Supreme Court's ruling is the culmination of a positive trend.

But at the same time, the lesbian/gay movement's increasing focus on marriage has reflected a negative trend. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the leadership of US LGBT movements was largely in the hands of the left. Its high points were the national marches in 1979, 1987 and 1994, which were organized through a painstakingly inclusive, democratic process and championed a broad range of progressive demands. The balance of LGBT forces shifted dramatically with the Millennium March on Washington in 2000, organized from the top down by the right-leaning Human Rights Campaign and the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches (a gay-founded Protestant denomination).  Although the National Equality March in 2009 was more broad-based, the movement has never fully returned to the left-leaning agenda of the previous century.""

Counterrevolutionaries on the march
Revolutions in the Arab world have been hijacked and crushed by reactionary forces [AFP]
Counterrevolutionaries on the march

By: Hamid Dabashi
Date of publication: 30 March, 2015

Comment: Since the Arab Spring revolutions threatened the status quo in the Middle East, tyrants, sympathisers and extremists have attempted to pull back the gains the people made.

With the Saudi military airstrike against Yemen, in active cooperation with its US, European, and regional allies, the counterrevolutionary forces mobilised against the aspirations of Arab revolutions are now in full gear and require a quick assessment. 

This invasion is the thematic finale of a successful counterrevolutionary mobilisation by a transnational coalition of entrenched forces trying to put an end to Arab revolutions. 

Mercenary army 

Joining the ranks of reactionary ruling Arab regimes is the mercenary army of Pakistan now put squarely at the service of safeguarding intransigent potentates. 

Pakistan has a long history in such services, against the will of the Pakistani people. According to a recent analysis: ""Dating back to the 1960s, Pakistan's experienced military helped train the undermanned and underprepared militaries of a number of fledgling Arab states. The former Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq once even commanded a unit of troops in Jordan tasked with combating Palestinian fighters."" 

We may not be able to reverse that reactionary course but we must read and record it accurately. Fresh out of a military coup against a democratically elected government, Generalissimo Abdel Fattah al-Sisi promises to send a military force into Yemen, in support of the Saudi invasion of a sovereign nation-state, you know the nastiest forces of the counterrevolution mean business. 

The Saudi military strike against Yemen is symptomatic of the larger frame of counterrevolutionary forces. According to reports, ""Saudi Arabia . . . begun military operations in Yemen, launching airstrikes in coordination with a coalition of ten nations. The strikes came as Yemen was hurtling closer to civil war after months of turmoil, as fighters and army units allied with the Houthi movement threatened to overrun the southern port of Aden where the besieged president, Abdrabbo Mansour Hadi, has gone into hiding."" 

These are not ""ten nations"" - these are ten ruling regimes that those nations meant to overthrow when they were crying for the whole world to hear: ""People Demand the Overthrow of the Regime."" Changing the political parlance of our realties is what the counterrevolution seeks to achieve. We must not yield. 

A significant minority of Yemenis are Zaydi Shias, manhandled by the Saudis to the point that under the leadership of Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi they were radicalised with the active patronage of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its own regional hegemony. 

The Saudis and Iranians are fighting a proxy war in Yemen for the same strategic and regional advantages that have seen them faceoff in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. 

But that does not change the historical fact that when millions of Yemenis poured into their streets and launched their revolution an entirely different political vision was at work than the one the Saudis and the ruling regime in Iran now wishes to register and routinise. 

The ruling interests in Saudi Arabia and Iran are adversaries in their hegemonic claims over the region, but identical in their mutual intentions to derail Arab revolutions to their advantage. In order to see this, we need to come closer to understanding the Saudi invasion from a larger frame of reference. 

 		The ruling interests in Saudi Arabia and Iran are adversaries in their hegemonic claims over the region. 

The Saudi air strikes against Yemen is not the first time the backward potentate flexes its military muscles to dominate the region to its retrograde advantage and change the historic course of Arab revolutions. 

Exactly four years ago, in March 2011, soon after the commencement of the Arab revolutions, the Saudis launched yet another military strike against Bahrain (aided and abetted by the British) to quell its revolutionary aspirations. 

At that time, everyone saw the military invasion as launched decidedly against the revolutionary aspiration of Bahrainis. 

But today, the Saudi-Iranians sectarianism and power mongering has succeeded in putting a different spin on the military strikes. It is imperative that we see the March 2011 invasion of Bahrain and March 2015 invasion of Yemen as indications of one and the same counterrevolutionary momentum. 

Proxy war

The Saudi militarism (fully endorsed by its regional, European and US allies) cannot be assessed in isolation. 

There are other, equally pernicious, counterrevolutionary forces at work for the last four years that require equal attention, without which the Saudi-generated narrative will dominate the politics of their adventurism and distort the historic course of Arab revolutions in their darkest moments. 

Who and what are these counterrevolutionary forces that have come together to frame and occasion the Saudi militarism? We may identify at least four particularly powerful and pestiferous factors. 

First and foremost: Arab revolutions have endangered the US imperial domination of the region and all its active and passive allies, ranging from its European and Israeli partners to countries extending from Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Turkey to Sisi's Egypt and beyond. 

President Obama and President Erdogan may have paid lip service to the will of the Arab people at the commencement of the revolutions, and the ruling clergy in Iran certainly sought to put an Islamist spin on it. 

But all of these interests were simultaneously endangered by the Arab uprisings that were geared to alter the very political DNA of the region, endangering the racist apartheid of Israel with the same measure that released the Kurdish revolutionary aspirations on the model of Kobani. 

Israel is integral to this counterrevolutionary syndrome. Netanyahu would not have dared to bomb Gaza and murder more Palestinians in July 2014 were it not for Sisi's military coup in Egypt exactly a year earlier in July 2013. Neither Sisi's coup in Egypt nor Netanyahu's mayhem in Gaza could have happened without US knowledge and approval. 

Second and most ferociously come the murderous machinations of the Islamic State group (IS, formerly known as ISIS), al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, etc. These are the most bloodthirsty counterrevolutionary forces throwing a monkey wrench at the civic and entirely non-violent course of the Arab revolutions. 

Each one of these militant bands of thugs and armed robbers has slightly different genealogy. But by far the most potent counterrevolutionary force among them is IS: born out of a number of conflating factors, including the US-led invasion of Iraq and the process of de-Baathification it initiated, Bashar al-Assad's cruel repression of the peaceful Syrian uprising, the Iranian intervention in Iraq and Syria that in conjunction with the Saudi-led resentment injected a militant sectarianism in the region.

And the Israeli intervention to fish in the muddy water that has resulted in stealing more of Palestine and murder more Palestinians. IS is the epitome of counterrevolutionary forces turning the cause and course of counterrevolutionary forces into a ""war on terror"".    

Third: the active rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran for regional domination, which has turned an otherwise entirely non-sectarian, decidedly cosmopolitan revolutionary environment into viciously sectarian hostility.  

Here the Iranian domination of the Iraqi, Syrian, and Lebanese scene is much a counterrevolutionary culprit as is the Saudi massive funding of militant thugs to resist an up the ante against the Iranian influence. 

The very introduction of Shia-Sunni factors in these revolutions is the direct result of the Saudi-Iranian rivalry for regional hegemony, and has absolutely nothing to do with two mutually complementary branches of Islam. 

The ludicrous assumption and repeated utterance that Iran is ""the leader of the Shia world"" and Saudi Arabia ""the leader of the Sunni world"" categorically distort the reality of our lived experiences. 

No one died and made the tyrannical Islamic Republic or the reactionary tribalism of a Saudi family the leader of anything or anybody. A plague on both their ruling houses has been the cry of freedom of Iranians and Arabs from the Green Movement to the Arab Spring. 

Fourth: No tallying of the counterrevolutionary forces actively working and writing against the ideals and aspirations of Arab and Muslim revolutions is complete without the inclusion of a particularly noisy, racist, morally corrupt, and intellectually bankrupt segments of the European and American ""left"" that from day one has been aggressive in its advocacy of murderous tyrants like Bashar al-Assad or Muammar Qaddafi. 

This small gang of irredeemably illiterate and pathologically immoral busybodies with a ludicrous claim of being ""left"" has no principled investment in these revolutions and has been consistently writing in active support of tyrannical monstrosities like Bashar al-Assad in the guise of an inept, clumsy, and sophomoric reading of imperialism they have regurgitated since their high school years — thus incapable of forming a single sentence with multiple subordinate clauses that opposes imperialism and defies tyranny at one and the same time. 

In their illiteracy, incompetence and immorality they are particularly angry at those among the Arab and Muslim left (the real left) that have left them behind in their critical thinking and have nothing for these racists but contempt. 

The only good Arab or Muslim for these racist white-supremacist, bastardised ""leftists"" are the dead Arab and Muslim left — tortured, murdered, and burned alive in the dungeons of their favourite tyrants in Syria and elsewhere. 

If an Arab or Muslim who identifies as left has a voice, a vision, a critical imagination that is beyond their pathetic reach and refuses to play second to their broken violin, she or he robs them the wrong way and puts them out of their business. 

In their despicable white-supremacist racism they hallucinate that with a mere high school diploma or half-baked college education or through their pathetic monolingual myopia they can teach leading Arab and Muslim thinkers the meaning of imperialism (the sheer obscenity of the assumption boggles the mind), thinking them infants incapable of charting the course of their own critical thinking and world-historic events. 

They are as detestable in their racism as the tyrants they support are in their murderous repressions.   

    		Saudi Arabia has launched this attack on Yemen to throw a monkey wrench at the US nuclear deal with Iran. 

Clearing the path ahead

On the surface the current counterrevolutionary mobilisations may be confusing: the US is helping the Saudis in Yemen to fight the Iran-backed Shia Houthis, while in Iraq it helps Iranian-backed Shia fight IS. But it is not.

The ruling interests in the US, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Israel, et al have a single common interest: to thwart and derail the Arab and Muslim revolutions and drag them into perpetual sectarian infighting. 

If we allow for the discourse to be determined by the rapidly changing headlines we will lose sight of the historic moment. The Saudi-Iranian regional rivalry is one nasty piece of a smokescreen blinding the sight. We must see through the charade.  

Saudi Arabia has launched this attack on Yemen to throw a monkey wrench at the US nuclear deal with Iran, and in this the retrograde kingdom and its allies are in solid solidarity with Israel. 

Consider these critical dates: Netanyahu's speech at the US Congress on 3 March, the letter 47 Republican senators sent to Iran on 9 March, and the Saudi-led airstrike against Yemen on 25 March are all integral to a nasty counterrevolutionary force, not just to torpedo the looming deadline of the US-Iran nuclear deal by 31 March, but far more importantly to change the revolutionary dynamics of the Arab world towards regional conflicts and sectarianism.  

The times we are living between the rise of Arab revolutions in 2010 and today in spring of 2015 is reminiscent of the time Europe experienced between the rise of the Spring of Nations during the revolutions of 1848, when Marx wrote his The Communist Manifesto and the rise of the counterrevolutionary tides that culminated in Marx writing The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte in 1852. 

As early as 1850 Marx had come to the conclusion that the revolutionary momentum had come to an end. ""The development of the revolution,"" as David Fernbach summarises Marx's disposition at this interval in his Introduction to the Penguin edition of Marx's Political Writings (1973), ""which had earlier seemed a matter of a few years, had now to be counted in decades."" 

The circumstances of global capitalism and its episodic crisis are vastly different today than it was at Marx's time, as are the treacheries of the counterrevolutionary forces, and therefore perforce must be our very notion of ""revolution"" and its open-ended possibilities. 

The lesson we learn from Marx's visionary assessment of the events before and after the 1848 revolutions in Europe is that he remained steadfast in his determination and commitment to the cause of the revolution.

IS and al-Qaeda gangs roaming in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen and the pro-mass murderers, racist European and US ""left"" clamouring on the internet come together and bookend and bracket counterrevolutionary forces in the region and beyond. 

They share one single mission: to deny and derail the legitimate cause and course of these revolutions.  

In between them, the real military forces of the region, ranging from the US and its allies to the sectarian power-mongering of Iran and Saudi Arabia, form an unholy alliance to change the very discourse and dynamics of daily politics in the region. 

They succeed to bomb and destroy their ways into the daily headlines. The singular mission of revolutionary thinkers of this time is to dismantle that mission and keep the ideals and aspirations of our democratic future alive.""

Finger argues that the Syriza government can take steps to free itself from the harsh dictates of the Troika by securitizing anticipated taxes and spending them as a parallel currency pegged to the Euro. As I see it, this may or may not result in Greece being forced out of the Eurozone, but in any case it would enable Greece to implement more of the program on which it was elected while at the same time continuing to work on convincing people in Europe and the rest of the world  that neoliberalism is savage and wrong and that socialist tranformation is key to achieving decent lives for people everywhere.  http://newpol.org/content/can-greece-defy-troika","Can Greece defy the Troika?, by Barry Finger, New Politics",link,http://newpol.org/content/can-greece-defy-troika,2015-03-06 17:38:36,3,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0

Today at 5: Paul Mason, Theopi Skarlatos, Stathis Kouvelakis on Syriza victory, Peter Kornbluh, Joyce Horman on some justice in Chile
Paul Mason, Economics editor of Channel 4 News joins us, with Theopi Skarlatos, to describe Syriza's triumphal electoral victory last Sunday. We'll ask what people in the streets around the country expect from Syriza and for their assessment of what Syriza can and must do. The first days are telling: consultants have been fired and janitors rehired, and Yanis Varoufakis, the new left-wing finance minister says his government will not negotiate over the Greek bailout conditions with the ""troika"" team from the EU and IMF, but will press for the cancellation of more than half the money Greece owes. 
Theopi Skarlatos is the director of the short film, ""Greece: The End of Austerity,"" which has gone viral online. She also writes for the BBC and is a master of bringing the ""feel"" from the ground to her audiences. In this short documentary Theopi and Paul say ""Syriza had 22 days to make history. This is how they did it. We followed Syriza's activists, candidates and leadership from the waterfront, to remote mountain villages, to the nail biting final days."" 

 Stathis Kouvelakis, Professor of French and Reader in Political Theory at King's College, member of Syriza's Central Committee and a leader of the Left Platform within the Party. He talked to Jacobin about some of the immediate, concrete challenges that will face Syriza now they are in power. The electoral triumph last Sunday in Greece has brought hope around the world, and Kouvelakis understands that if Syriza fails, there will be incalculable consequences. We'll get his analysis.

Peter Kornbluh and Joyce Horman join us to celebrate a little justice more than 41 years after the fact: Two of the Chilean intelligence officials have at last been sentenced in the murders of two American citizens, Charlie Horman and Frank Teruggi, shortly after the 1973 coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet. …
