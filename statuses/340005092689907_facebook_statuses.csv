It's easy: Tell Trump in a video why you are resisting him. If you'd rather not participate in the video challenge, make a donation of whatever you can afford to either the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Southern Poverty Law Center or PBS in Donald Trump's name -- he will get a thank you card. His address is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500. Post this status, your video and/or the organization to which you donated to social media with the hashtag #WhyWeResist and then challenge at least three more people.

This is a planetary emergency and we need to do something about it NOW. Do not despair, take action. Here are five things you can do RIGHT NOW:

1. Cut down on meat consumption, particularly beef. By reducing your meat consumption by 20 percent, you'll achieve the same positive impact on climate crisis as you would by switching from a regular car to a hybrid. Less beef means less deforestation and less destruction of other species. 

2. Stop buying crap. Seriously, do you really need that new iPhone? Save the money instead and put it towards getting a more fuel efficient car. Or just buy used goods. 

3. Car pool. Try to get rides with friends and family rather than driving yourself. a 20% reduction in car rides is 20% less CO2 you are pumping into the atmosphere. 

4. Buy food from sustainable farms. Yes, it really is that simple. Sustainable farming actually has a positive, regenerative effect on local ecosystems, so we need to start supporting them pronto. 

5. Vote for politicians who will take action on the environment.

But some rules can't be broken, because the entire foundation of our democracy rides on them.

While speaking in Pittsburgh, he decried the current media landscape. 'We are going to have to rebuild within this wild, wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to,' Obama said. 'There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard, because they just don't have any basis in anything that's actually happening in the world.' Obama's comments came as a response to Donald Trump's almost entirely fact-free presidential campaign, one based on internet conspiracy theory and mindless right-wing outrage rather than actual logic and reason. Granted, Trump is his own nonstop geyser of utter horseshit, a human ouroboran loop feeding nonsense directly into the internet conspiracy machine from which he also draws some of his best, most baseless crap. But Trump's audience was ready-made to believe anything, no matter how ridiculous, because it already lived inside a hermetically sealed bubble that only news confirming its biases could penetrate.""",The Internet's Brave New World Has Become a Disinformation Dystopia,link,http://thedailybanter.com/2016/10/lies-on-the-internet/,2016-10-19 18:01:01,17,1,3,17,0,0,0,0,0

We meet, we fall in love -- and no matter how vigorously we promise to stay (until the wisteria fades), we move on. If we're lucky, a magical troubadour like Gord Downie will join us for the ride.""

It's difficult to imagine that anyone currently laughing at the statues of naked, ball-less Trump or otherwise mocking his cartoonish appearance goes through his or her life being the kind of narcissistic, pathologically lying, bigoted bully and would-be fascist dictator Trump does. And while it's easy to make the argument that we should be criticizing Trump's horrific behavior and the incoherent gibberish that passes for his draconian policy proposals rather than his sagging orange skin, ridiculous hair and parody penis, it's safe to say there's room for both -- and both are necessary. At all times, serious people should be fighting back against everything he stands for, but make no mistake: you only defeat someone like Trump by pointing and laughing loudly at everything about him that's a source of his pomposity and braggadocio.

Social Security enjoys stratospheric support, even among 70 percent of Republican rank-and-file voters. It's the greatest anti-poverty program that the U.S. has ever enacted. It's been an especially important support system for minority and female retirees; three-quarters of Americans depend heavily on Social Security in their elderly years, and nearly half would be living in poverty without it.

Most of them will never go back and read the post-factum write-ups that set the record straight and call out Trump for being the king of crap.

Those days are gone, though. The beginning of the end was marked by Sanders's refusal to immediately denounce surrogates that were trafficking in conspiracy theory and character assassination. From there, it moved to Sanders sanctioning a protest in East L.A. where his supporters shouted obscenities at men, women and children who'd come to a Clinton event, forcing them to run a gauntlet of verbal abuse. Now today there's this: Bernie Sanders's offensively haughty and indifferent response on Tuesday to his followers' unhinged, even violent extended outburst at the Nevada Democratic Convention and his laughably tepid 'condemnation' of the misogynistic intimidation tactics that have followed. All of it over a decision by Nevada's Democratic party that cost Bernie Sanders just four delegates, a thoroughly meaningless number when he still would've been behind Clinton by 278 delegates.""",Bernie Sanders Refuses To Admit There's a Problem With His Fanatical Supporters,link,http://thedailybanter.com/2016/05/bernie-sanders-defiantly-defends-supporters/,2016-05-17 23:48:30,271,85,234,205,11,2,2,8,43

'Can You Not Like the New ""Ghostbusters"" and Not Be a Misogynist Prick?' - Chez Pazienza argues that the negative reaction to the Ghostbusters trailer was at least partially an angry overreaction by misogynistic douchebags, but also because it intrudes on the magic of the 1984 classic. Is it ok to say that without being labeled a sexist?

An egomaniac. A spoiler. A boilerplate bully. No, as of yet Sanders's acolytes haven't physically hurt anyone, but their manic devotion to their candidate has created an ugly atmosphere and physical violence isn't the only way to behave thuggishly. Just ask some of those Democratic superdelegates, who claim to now be on the receiving end of harassment and threats, often tinged with misogyny, aimed at getting them to change their votes over to Sanders. (Again, that's not going to happen, and if anyone doing this thinks it's the best way to get someone to look upon Sanders as a more favorable choice, they're obviously out-to-lunch.) Between that and Sanders's own insinuation that his campaign might seek to subvert the will of the voters when it comes time for the superdelegates to throw in their votes -- poaching from states he didn't even win, which he once decried as undemocratic -- and we have an election cycle dominated by the extremes on both the right and the left.""",Bernie Sanders Has Become the Left's Answer To Donald Trump,link,http://thedailybanter.com/2016/04/bernie-sanders-lefts-donald-trump/,2016-04-04 21:13:30,176,82,59,151,10,2,2,4,7

There are those who see the ""Bernie or Bust"" movement as strictly an internet phenomenon, one promoted only by impressionable kids who probably won't vote anyway, but Sarandon has just elevated it and given a face to it. And, as it turns out, it's the face of L'Oreal, a face attached to an Oscar-winning actress and member of Hollywood royalty. In case that isn't enough to point out the laughable irony of Sarandon's apparent willingness to throw the country under the bus, let's make it crystal clear: Susan Sarandon is as privileged an individual as they come, someone almost certainly insulated from whatever catastrophes the country might experience under a President Trump, and yet she sees no problem leaving the rest of us plebes to drown. She's the prime example of the moral bankruptcy of those claiming that a Trump presidency would actually be good for the country in the long run -- because she's not the one who'll have to sacrifice to achieve her dream of a democratic socialist utopia.""",Susan Sarandon Is a Privileged Idiot,link,http://thedailybanter.com/2016/03/susan-sarandon-trump-clinton-idiot/,2016-03-29 13:20:00,246,61,66,201,11,0,7,1,26

It's a standard beer made by a big domestic company, a beer with a long history and an easy association with working class America. So why is one beloved by Millennials while another is shunned?

But by shouting his name during their push to shut down Trump's rally last week, Sanders's young supporters made it seem like his campaign is simply the left-wing answer to Trump's. No doubt that's why the protest's organizers initially wanted to keep their action independent and not attached to any one particular Trump challenger: because the message needed to be that Trump was a genuine threat to our nation and its people rather than, 'Trump's dangerous, here's the alternative! Feel the Bern!' In fact, by making it seem as if Trump's detractors were all agents of Bernie Sanders, Sanders's supporters gave Trump an easy out and the perfect target to deflect criticism onto in the wake of the brawl. He's already blamed ""communist"" Bernie for wrecking his rally and quashing his First Amendment rights.

""The real issue with these photos isn't necessarily Trig abusing Jill, potentially cracking ribs and doing other kinds of internal damage, which kind of sucks. This is about Palin being totally oblivious to it. It's white-trash ignorance. Parents who allow their children to abuse animals are arguably worse than the abusive children. Kids don't know any better because they haven't been taught that dogs are living, emotional beings that can be injured, tortured and killed. Worse, dogs have been known to reach a breaking point and to retaliate against abusers. So, let's for a moment fast forward a few years when, perhaps, Jill gets fed up with being stepped on and bites Trig. What sort of hillbilly justice do you think the Palins will dish out should Trig be injured by the dog? Say buh-bye to Jill, all because Palin is too stupid to recognize that dogs aren't ladders, furniture or disposable toys.""","MEMBERS ONLY: It's Not About Trig Palin Standing on a Dog, It's About Sarah Palin Not Getting...",link,http://thedailybanter.com/2015/01/members-trig-standing-dog-sarah-palin-getting-bad/#hthTIfVejRdKZEow.99,2015-01-06 15:25:21,86,16,13,86,0,0,0,0,0
