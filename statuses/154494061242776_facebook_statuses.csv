The Beltway Conspiracy to Break Trump
By Patrick J. Buchanan

At Mar-a-Lago this weekend President Donald Trump was filled ""with fury"" says The Washington Post, ""mad — steaming, raging, mad.""

Early Saturday the fuming president exploded with this tweet: ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!""

The president has reason to be enraged. For what is afoot is a loose but broad conspiracy to break and bring him down, abort his populist agenda, and overturn the results of the 2016 election.

At its heart is the ""deep state"" — agents of the intel community, their media collaborators, and their amen corner in a Democratic party whose control of our permanent government is all but total.

At the heart of the case against Trump is what appears to be a Big Lie.

It is that Vladimir Putin and Russian intelligence hacked the DNC and John Podesta's email account, then colluded with Trump's friends or associates to systematically sabotage Hillary Clinton's campaign. Therefore, Trump stole the election and is an illegitimate president. In this city, Trump is looked upon as a border-jumper, an illegal alien.

Yet let us consider the constituent components of the charge.

For months, we have heard that U.S. intel agencies agree that the Russians hacked the DNC and Clinton campaign, and gave the fruits of their cybertheft to WikiLeaks, because Putin wanted Trump to win.

For months, this storyline has been investigated by the FBI and the intelligence committees of both houses of Congress.

Yet where is the body of evidence that the Russians did this?

More critically, where is the evidence Trump's people played an active role in the operation? Why is it taking the FBI the better part of a year to come up with a single indictment in this Trump-Putin plot?

Is this all smoke and mirrors?

In late February, The New York Times reported that Trump officials had been in regular touch with Russian intelligence officers.

The smoking gun had been found!

Yet, almost immediately after that report, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told Fox News ""the top levels of the intelligence community"" had assured him that the allegations of campaign contacts with Russia were ""not only grossly overstated, but also wrong.""

If what Reince says is true, the real crime here is U.S. security officials enlisting their Fourth Estate collaborators, who enjoy First Amendment privileges against having to testify under oath or being prosecuted, to undermine the elected commander in chief.

Now we expect Russia to seek to steal our secrets as we steal theirs. After all, our NSA wiretapped Angela Merkel and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. Our National Endowment for Democracy pushes ""color revolutions"" to bring about regime change in the near abroad of Putin's Russian Federation.

Our NGOs are being restricted, shut down, expelled from Russia, China, Israel and Egypt, because they have been caught interfering in the internal affairs of those countries.

There is talk that Putin use the pilfered emails as payback for Clinton's urging demonstrators to take to the streets of Moscow to protest a narrow victory by his United Russia party in 2011.

As for the alleged wiretapping of Trump Tower, President Obama has denied ordering any such thing and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper assures us nothing of the sort was ever done.

Yet, there are other reports that intelligence officials got a warrant to surveil Trump campaign officials or the Trump Tower, and, though failing to succeed in the FISA court that authorizes such surveillance in June, they did succeed in October.

If true, this is a far more explosive matter than whether a Trump aide may have told the Russians, ""You're doing a great job!"" when WikiLeaks blew DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz out of her job for tilting the playing field against Bernie Sanders in the primaries.

What needs to be done now?

The White House should tell the Justice Department to tell the FBI to expedite its investigation and file a report on what was done by the Russians. And if any Trump campaign official criminally colluded with the Russians, send the recommendation to indict to Justice.

The acting attorney general should instruct Director James Comey to run down, remove and recommend for prosecution any FBI or intel agent who has leaked the fruits of their investigation, or fake news, to the media. If Comey cannot find the source of the leaks, or lies, coming out of this investigation, a housecleaning may be needed at the bureau.

While President Obama may not have ordered any surveillance of Trump or his advisors, the real question is whether he or Attorney General Loretta Lynch were aware of or approved of any surveillance of Trump and his staff during the campaign.

Russian hacking of the DNC is a problem, not a scandal. The scandal is this: Who inside the government of the United States is trying to discredit, damage or destroy the President of the United States?

For these are the real subversives.",,status,,2017-03-08 15:27:46,3,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0

The First Firestorm
By Patrick J. Buchanan

That hysterical reaction to the travel ban announced Friday is a portent of what is to come if President Donald Trump carries out the mandate given to him by those who elected him.

The travel ban bars refugees for 120 days. From Syria, refugees are banned indefinitely. And a 90-day ban has been imposed on travel here from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.

Was that weekend-long primal scream really justified?

As of Monday, no one was being detained at a U.S. airport.

Yet the shrieking had not stopped. All five stories on page one of Monday's Washington Post were about the abomination. The New York Times' editorial, ""Trashing American Ideals and Security,"" called it bigoted, cowardly, xenophobic, Islamophobic, un-American, unrighteous.

This ban, went the weekend wail, is the ""Muslim ban"" of the Trump campaign. But how so, when not one of the six largest Muslim countries — Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkey — was on the list? Missing also were three-dozen other Muslim countries.

Of the seven countries facing a 90-day ban, three are U.S.-designated state sponsors of terror, and the other four are war zones. Clearly, this is about homeland security, not religious discrimination.

The criterion for being included in the travel ban appears to be that these places are the more likely breeding grounds for terrorists.

Yet there are lessons for the Trump White House in the media-stoked panic and outrage at the end of his first week in office.

First, Steve Bannon's observation that the media are ""the opposition party,"" is obviously on target. While Sen. Chuck Schumer was crying on camera that the ban was ""un-American,"" the media were into the more serious business of stampeding and driving the protesters.

A second lesson is one every White House learns. Before a major decision is announced, if possible, get everyone's input and everyone on board to provide what Pat Moynihan called the ""second and third echelons of advocacy."" Those left out tend to leak.

A third lesson Trump should learn is that the establishment he routed and the city he humiliated are out to break him as they broke LBJ on Vietnam, Nixon on Watergate, and almost broke Reagan on the Iran-Contra affair.

While the establishment may no longer be capable of inspiring and leading the nation, so detested is it, it has not lost its appetite or its ability to break and bring down presidents.

And Trump is vulnerable, not only because he is an envied outsider who seized the highest prize politics has on offer, but because his agenda would cancel out that of the elites.

They believe in open borders, free trade, globalization. Trump believes in securing the Southern border, bringing U.S. industry home, economic nationalism, ""America First.""

They want endless immigration from the Third World to remake America into the polyglot ""universal nation"" of Ben Wattenberg's utopian vision. Trump's followers want back the America they knew.

Our foreign policy elites see democratization as a vocation and an autocratic Russia as an implacable enemy. Trump instead sees Moscow as a potential ally against real enemies like al-Qaida and ISIS.

There is another reason for the reflexive howl at Trump's travel ban. The establishment views it, probably correctly, as the first move toward a new immigration policy, built on pre-1965 foundations, and rooted in a preference for Western-Christian immigrants first.

When the Times rages that ""American ideals"" or ""traditional American values"" are under attack by Trump, what they really mean is that their ideology and agenda are threatened by Trump.

We are headed for a series of collisions and crises, and what has happened in Europe will likely happen here. As the Third World invasion and growing Islamization of the Old Continent — which the EU has proven unable to stop — has discredited centrist parties and continuously fed a populist-nationalist uprising there, so may it here also.

And Trump not only appears to have no desire to yield to his enemies in politics and the media, he has no choice, as he is now the personification of a surging Middle American counterrevolution.

Undeniably, there are great numbers of Americans who agree with the libels the Times showered on Trump and, by extension, his backers whom Hillary Clinton designated ""the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic ... deplorables.""

But by whatever slurs they are called, Middle Americans seem prepared to fight. And history shows that such people do not calmly accept the loss of what is most precious to them — the country they grew up in, the country they love.

They have turned to Trump to lead them. Why should he not, having been raised up by them, and knowing in his own heart what the establishment and the media think of him and would do to him?

HOW TRUMP WINS THE DEBATE

On one of my first trips to New Hampshire in 1991, to challenge President George H. W. Bush, I ran into Sen. Eugene McCarthy.

He was returning to the scene of his '68 triumph, when he had inflicted the first crippling wound on Lyndon Johnson.

""Pat, you don't have to win up here, you know,"" he assured me. ""All you have to do is beat the point spread.""

While Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, England voted for independence. These people, with their unique history, language and culture, want to write their own laws and rule themselves.

HAS TRUMP FOUND THE FORMULA?
By Patrick J. Buchanan

Stripped of its excesses, Donald Trump's Wednesday speech contains all the ingredients of a campaign that can defeat Hillary Clinton this fall.

Indeed, after the speech ended Clinton was suddenly defending the Clinton Foundation against the charge that it is a front for a racket for her family's enrichment.

The specific charges in Trump's indictment of Clinton: She is mendacious, corrupt, incompetent and a hypocrite.

""Hillary Clinton … is a world-class liar,"" said Trump. She faked a story about being under fire at a Bosnia airport, the kind of claim for which TV anchors get fired. She has lied repeatedly about her email server.

She lied to the families of victims of the Benghazi massacre by implying the atrocity was a spontaneous reaction to an anti-Islamic video, not the premeditated act of Islamist terror she knew it to be.

Drop ""world-class"" and Trump's case is open and shut. (Read entire artlcle at: http://www.theamericancause.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1298&cntnt01origid=26&cntnt01returnid=29)",,status,,2016-08-22 11:22:30,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

TROLLING FOR WAR WITH RUSSIA
By Patrick J. Buchanan

Some 50 State Department officials have signed a memo calling on President Obama to launch air and missile strikes on the Damascus regime of Bashar Assad.

A ""judicious use of stand-off and air weapons,"" they claim, ""would undergird and drive a more focused and hard-nosed U.S.-led diplomatic process.""

In brief, to strengthen the hand of our diplomats and show we mean business, we should start bombing and killing Syrian soldiers.

Yet Syria has not attacked us. And Congress has not declared war on Syria, or authorized an attack. Where do these State hawks think President Obama gets the authority to launch a war on Syria?

Does State consider the Constitution to be purely advisory when it grants Congress the sole power to declare war? Was not waging aggressive war the principal charge against the Nazis at Nuremberg?

If U.S. bombs and missiles rain down on Damascus, to the cheers of the C-Street Pattons, what do we do if Bashar Assad's allies Iran and Hezbollah retaliate with Benghazi-type attacks on U.S. diplomats across the Middle East? What do we do if Syrian missiles and Russian planes starting shooting down U.S. planes?

IS ISLAMIC TERROR AMERICA'S FUTURE?
By Patrick J. Buchanan

If the cliches hold — nothing succeeds like success, the past is prologue — this generation will not likely see an end to the jihadist terror that was on display at Pulse in Orlando on Sunday.

For terrorism has proven to be among the most cost-effective and successful strategies of war that the world has ever seen.

Consider. The 9/11 attacks involved 19 hijackers willing to crash airliners into four buildings: the World Trade Center towers, the Pentagon and the Capitol.

So doing, those 19 altered the foreign policy of the United States.

They drew the world's last superpower into wars that have bled and almost bankrupted us, broken a president, and left us mired in half a dozen civil and sectarian conflicts with no exit or end in sight.

As a political terrorist, Osama bin Laden rivals Gavrilo Princip, whose assassination of the Austrian archduke set in train the events that led to the Great War that brought on the downfall of the West.

IT AIN'T OVER TIL IT'S OVER

""I did it my way,"" crooned Sinatra.

Donald Trump is echoing Ol' Blue Eyes with the latest additions to his staff. Should he lose, he prefers to go down to defeat as Donald Trump, and not as some synthetic creation of campaign consultants.

""I am who I am,"" Trump told a Wisconsin TV station, ""It's me. I don't want to change. ... I don't want to pivot. ... If you start pivoting, you are not being honest with people.""

The remarks recall the San Francisco Cow Palace where an astonished Republican, on hearing the candidate speak out in favor of ""extremism in the defense of liberty,"" blurted out, ""My God, he's going to run as Barry Goldwater!""

And so he did. And Goldwater is remembered and revered by many who have long forgotten all the trimmers of both parties who tailored their convictions to suit the times, and lost.

Trump believes populism and nationalism are the future of America, and wants to keep saying so. Nor is this stance inconsistent with recapturing the ground lost in the weeks since he was running even with Hillary Clinton.

ISLAM AND THE WEST: IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT?

On Saturday night, Omar Mateen was a loner and a loser.

Sunday, he was immortal, by his standards, a hero. Mateen had ended his life in a blaze of gunfire and glory. Now everybody knew his name.

He had been embraced by ISIS. His face was on every TV screen. His 911 call to Orlando police identifying with the Islamic State and the Tsarnaev brothers of the Boston Marathon massacre was being heard across America.

He was being called the most successful Islamist terrorist since 9/11. A hater of homosexuals, Mateen had, all alone, massacred more than four dozen patrons at a gay Florida nightclub, wounded 53, and driven deeper the wedges breaking up America. When it was learned that he used an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, America's gun wars were reignited.

And make no mistake. There are out there in society some few looking at what Mateen did, and how he left this world, not in revulsion and disgust but admiration and awe.

WHY TRUMP MUST NOT APOLOGIZE

""Never retreat. Never explain. Get it done and let them howl.""

Donald Trump has internalized the maxim Benjamin Jowett gave to his students at Balliol who would soon be running the empire.

And in rejecting demands that he apologize for his remarks about the La Raza judge presiding over the class-action suit against Trump University, the Donald is instinctively correct

Before the lynching of The Donald proceeds, what exactly was it he said about that Hispanic judge?

Stated succinctly, Donald Trump said U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a class-action suit against Trump University, is sticking it to him. And the judge's bias is likely rooted in the fact that he is of Mexican descent.

Can there be any defense of a statement so horrific?

Just this. First, Trump has a perfect right to be angry about the judge's rulings and to question his motives. Second, there are grounds for believing Trump is right.

THE GREAT WHITE HOPE
By Patrick J. Buchanan

""Something startling is happening to middle-aged white Americans. Unlike every other age group, unlike every other racial and ethnic group ... death rates in this group have been rising, not falling.""

The big new killers of middle-aged white folks? Alcoholic liver disease, overdoses of heroin and opioids, and suicides. So wrote Gina Kolata in The New York Times of a stunning study by the husband-wife team of Nobel laureate Angus Deaton and Anne Case.

Deaton could cite but one parallel to this social disaster: ""Only H.I.V./AIDS in contemporary times has done anything like this.""

Middle-aged whites are four times as likely as middle-aged blacks to kill themselves. Their fitness levels are falling as they suffer rising levels of physical pain, emotional stress and mental depression, which helps explain the alcohol and drug addiction.

IS SCARBOROUGH SHOAL WORTH A WAR?
By Patrick J. Buchanan

If China begins to reclaim and militarize Scarborough Shoal, says Philippines President Benigno S. Aquino III, America must fight.

Should we back down, says Aquino, the United States will lose ""its moral ascendancy, and also the confidence of one of its allies.""

And what is Scarborough Shoal?

A cluster of rocks and reefs, 123 miles west of Subic Bay, that sits astride the passageway out of the South China Sea into the Pacific, and is well within Manila's 200-mile exclusive economic zone.

Beijing and Manila both claim Scarborough Shoal. But, in June 2013, Chinese ships swarmed and chased off a fleet of Filipino fishing boats and naval vessels. The Filipinos never came back.

WHO'S THE CONSERVATIVE HERETIC?

In his coquettish refusal to accept the Donald, Paul Ryan says he cannot betray the conservative ""principles"" of the party of Abraham Lincoln, high among which is a devotion to free trade.

But when did free trade become dogma in the Party of Lincoln?

TRUMP OR RYAN: WHO SPEAKS FOR THE GOP?
By Patrick J. Buchanan

""No modern precedent exists for the revival of a party so badly defeated, so intensely discredited, and so essentially split as the Republican Party is today.""

Taken from ""The Party That Lost Its Head"" by Bruce Chapman and George Gilder, this excerpt, about Barry Goldwater's defeat in 1964, led Thursday's column by E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post.

Dionne is warning what could happen if the GOP perpetrates the political atrocity of nominating Donald Trump.

For weeks now, the Post's editorial page has sermonized about the ""moral"" obligation of all righteous Republicans to repudiate Trump.

The Post's solicitude for the well-being of the Republican Party is the stuff of legend. Yet it is a bit jarring to see these champions of abortion on demand, same-sex marriage, and visitation rights for cross-dressers in the girls' room, standing in a pulpit lecturing on morality.

Forty-eight hours after Donald Trump wrapped up the Republican nomination with a smashing victory in the Indiana primary, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that he could not yet support Trump.

In millennial teen-talk, Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper, ""I'm just not ready to do that at this point. I'm not there right now.""

""[T]he bulk of the burden of unifying the party"" falls on Trump, added Ryan. Trump must unify ""all wings of the Republican Party, and the conservative movement."" Trump must run a campaign that we can ""be proud to support and proud to be a part of.""

BUSH REPUBLICANISM IS DEAD AND GONE
By Patrick J. Buchanan

""The two living Republican past presidents, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, have no plans to endorse Trump, according to their spokesmen."" So said the lead story in The Washington Post.

Graceless, yes, but not unexpected. The Bushes have many fine qualities. Losing well, however, is not one of them.

And they have to know, whether they concede it or not, that Trump's triumph is a sweeping repudiation of Bush Republicanism by the same party that nominated them four times for the presidency.

Not only was son and brother, Jeb, humiliated and chased out of the race early, but Trump won his nomination by denouncing as rotten to the core the primary fruits of signature Bush policies.
Twelve million aliens are here illegally, said Trump, because the Bushes failed to secure America's borders.

America has run up $12 trillion in trade deficits and been displaced as the world's first manufacturing power by China, said Trump, because of the lousy trade deals backed by Bush Republicans.

IS A NEW GOP BEING BORN?
By Patrick J. Buchanan

The first four Republican contests — Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada — produced record turnouts.

While the prospect of routing Hillary Clinton and recapturing the White House brought out the true believers, it was Donald Trump's name on the ballot and his calls for economic patriotism, border security, and an end to imperial wars that brought out the throngs.

The crowds that continue to come out for his appearances and the vast audiences he has attracted to GOP debates testify to his drawing power.

Moreover, Trump has now been endorsed by Gov. Chris Christie, ex-chairman of the Republican Governors Association, and Sen. Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected conservatives on Capitol Hill.

Yet, with polls pointing to a possible Trump sweep on Super Tuesday, save Texas, his probable nomination, and a chance for the GOP to take it all in the fall, is causing some conservatives and Republicans to threaten to bolt, go third party, stay home, or even vote for Clinton.

They would prefer to lose to Clinton than win with Trump.

THE OLIGARCHS' SUPER-PAC ANTI-TRUMP SAVAGERY

Narrow victories in the Kentucky caucuses and the Louisiana primary, the largest states decided on Saturday, have moved Donald Trump one step nearer to the nomination.

Primaries in Michigan, Mississippi and Idaho on March 8, and in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina on March 15, may prove decisive. If Marco Rubio does not win his home state of Florida, he is cooked, as is Gov. John Kasich if he does not win Ohio.

Ted Cruz already looks to be the last man between Trump and a GOP nomination that has gone, in the last seven elections, to George H. W. Bush, Bob Dole, George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney.

Donald Trump ""appeals to racism.""

""[F]rom the beginning … his campaign has profited from voter prejudice and hatred"" and represents an ""authoritarian assault upon democracy.""

If Speaker Paul Ryan wishes to be ""on the right side of history … he must condemn Mr. Trump clearly and comprehensively. The same goes for every other Republican leader.""

""Maybe that would split the (Republican) party,"" but, ""No job is worth the moral stain that would come from embracing (Trump). No party is worth saving at the expense of the country.""

If Republican leaders wish to be regarded as moral, every one of them must renounce Trump, even if it means destroying their party.

Who has laid down this moral mandate? The Holy Father in Rome?

No. The voice posturing as the conscience of America is the Washington Post, which champions abortion on demand and has not, in the memory of this writer, endorsed any Republican for president – though it did endorse Marion Barry three times for mayor of D.C.

The New Year's execution by Saudi Arabia of the Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr Baqir al-Nimr was a deliberate provocation.

ISLAM AND THE WEST: AN IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT?

AMERICA TURNS RIGHT

By Patrick J. Buchanan

In Sunday's first-round of regional elections in France, the clear and stunning winner was the National Front of Marine Le Pen.

Her party rolled up 30 percent of the vote, and came in first in 6 of 13 regions. Marine herself won 40 percent of her northeast district.

Despite tremendous and positive publicity from his presidential role in the Charlie Hebdo and Paris massacres and the climate summit, Francois Hollande's Socialist Party ran third.

What drove the victory of the National Front?

According to The Wall Street Journal's William Horobin, ""Ms. Le Pen, who has combined the party's anti-immigration stance with calls for hard-line security measures and tighter control of France's borders, has only bolstered her support in the three weeks since the Paris attacks.""

The rightward shift in French politics is being replicated across Europe, as nations tighten borders and erect new checkpoints against the tsunami of migrants and refugees from Africa and the Middle East.

Angela Merkel and open borders are yesterday in Europe; Marine Le Pen is tomorrow. (Read the entire article at: http://www.theamericancause.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1244&cntnt01origid=26&cntnt01returnid=29)",,status,,2016-01-30 12:49:00,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The conservative movement is starting to look a lot like Syria.

Baited, taunted, mocked by Fox News, Donald Trump told Roger Ailes what he could do with his Iowa debate, and marched off to host a Thursday night rally for veterans at the same time in Des Moines.

Message: I speak for the silent majority, Roger, not you, not Megyn Kelly, not Fox News. Diss me, and I will do fine without Fox.

WHY LIBERAL MEDIA HATE TRUMP

By Patrick J. Buchanan

In the feudal era there were the ""three estates"" — the clergy, the nobility and the commons. The first and second were eradicated in Robespierre's Revolution.

But in the 18th and 19th century, Edmund Burke and Thomas Carlyle identified what the latter called a ""stupendous Fourth Estate.""

Wrote William Thackeray: ""Of the Corporation of the Goosequill — of the Press ... of the fourth estate. ... There she is — the great engine — she never sleeps. She has her ambassadors in every quarter of the world — her courtiers upon every road. Her officers march along with armies, and her envoys walk into statesmen's cabinets.""

The fourth estate, the press, the disciples of Voltaire, had replaced the clergy it had dethroned as the new arbiters of morality and rectitude.

About Muslim celebrations in Berlin, however, there appears to be no doubt. In my chapter ""Eurabia,"" in ""State of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America,"" [2006] is this quote from The New York Times Magazine, exactly 10 years ago.

""Parallel to the declarations of 'unconditional solidarity' with Americans by the German majority, rallies of another sort were taking place in Neukolln and Kreuzberg. Bottle rockets were set off from building courtyards, a poor man's fireworks, sporadic, sparse and joyful; two rockets here, three rockets there. Still, altogether, hundreds of rockets were shooting skyward in celebration of the attack, as most Berliners were searching for words to express their horror.""

STUMBLING TO WAR WITH RUSSIA?

By Patrick J. Buchanan

Turkey's decision to shoot down a Russian warplane was a provocative and portentous act.

That Sukhoi Su-24, which the Turks say intruded into their air space, crashed and burned — in Syria. One of the Russian pilots was executed while parachuting to safety. A Russian rescue helicopter was destroyed by rebels using a U.S. TOW missile. A Russian marine was killed.

""A stab in the back by the accomplices of terrorists,"" said Vladimir Putin of the first downing of a Russian warplane by a NATO nation in half a century. Putin has a point, as the Russians are bombing rebels in northwest Syria, some of which are linked to al-Qaida.

Congress has punted. And compared to the cacophony from Republican ranks, Barack Obama sounds like Prince Bismarck.

The President's strategy is to contain, degrade and defeat ISIS. While no one has provided the troops to defeat ISIS, the U.S. is using Kurdish and Yazidi forces, backed by U.S. air power, to degrade it.

A haunting remark, since, for 40 years, America was largely united on the proposition that our survival depended upon our victory over communism in the Cold War.

We had a cause then. By and large, we stood together through the crises in the first decades of that Cold War — the Berlin blockade, Stalin's atom bomb and the fall of China to Mao, the Korean War, the Hungarian revolution, the Cuban missile crisis, and on into Vietnam.

We accepted the conscription of our young men. We accepted wars in Asia, and, if need be, in Europe, to check the Soviet Empire.

Vietnam sundered that unity. (Read the entire article at:  http://www.theamericancause.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1231&cntnt01origid=26&cntnt01returnid=29)",,status,,2015-11-24 20:33:40,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

CAN TRUMP BE STOPPED?

Three months ago, this writer sent out a column entitled, ""Could Trump Win?"" meaning the Republican nomination.

TO END WARS -- TRUMP VS. SANDERS
By Patrick J. Buchanan

Barack Obama sought as his legacy to bring an end to the two longest wars in U.S. history. On Oct. 15, he, again, admitted failure.

The 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan will remain another year. And, on Inauguration Day 2017, 5,500 U.S. troops will still be there.

Why cannot we leave? Because, if we do, we risk the re-seizure of power by the Taliban we drove out 14 years ago, and a wipeout of all we have accomplished in America's longest war.

DON'T TAKE YOUR GUNS TO TOWN, PAUL

The honor of it all aside, Rep. Paul Ryan would do well to decline the speakership of the House. For it is a poisoned chalice that is being offered to him.

The Republican Party is not, as some commentators wail, in ""chaos"" today. It is in rebellion, in revolt, as it was in the early 1960s when Barry Goldwater's true believers rejected Eisenhower Republicanism and Nelson Rockefeller to nominate the Arizona Senator for president.

WAR PARTY TARGETS PUTIN AND ASSAD
By Patrick J. Buchanan

Having established a base on the Syrian coast, Vladimir Putin last week began air strikes on ISIS and other rebel forces seeking to overthrow Bashar Assad.

A longtime ally of Syria, Russia wants to preserve its toehold on the Mediterranean, help Assad repel the threat, and keep the Islamic terrorists out of Damascus.

Russia is also fearful that the fall of Assad would free up the Chechen terrorists in Syria to return to Russia.

In intervening to save Assad, Putin is doing exactly what we are doing to save our imperiled allies in Baghdad and Kabul.

Yet Putin's intervention has ignited an almost berserk reaction. (Read the entire article at: http://www.theamericancause.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1226&cntnt01origid=26&cntnt01returnid=29)",,status,,2015-10-26 12:23:00,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

What Vladimir Putin is up to in Syria makes far more sense than what Barack Obama and John Kerry appear to be up to in Syria.

Syrian President Bashar Assad, an ally of Russia, has lost half his country to ISIS and the Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaida.

Yet Nixon went to Moscow and signed the first strategic arms agreement of the Cold War. He did not let Soviet-backed aggression against an ally prevent him from signing a SALT agreement he believed was in the vital interests of the United States.

Since China devalued its currency 3 percent, global markets have gone into a tailspin. Why should this be?

While perhaps too early for Democratic elites to panic and begin bailing out on Hillary Clinton's campaign as a doomed vessel, they would be well advised not to miss any of the lifeboat drills.

Turkey joined NATO and let the U.S. station Jupiter missiles in their country. When JFK secretly traded away the Jupiters for removal of the Soviet missiles in Cuba, the Turks went along.

Early this century, under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey seemed to be emerging as a major power, a land bridge between Europe and the Islamic world, a friend to its neighbors, and future member of the EU.

A MIDEAST GAME OF THRONES
By Patrick J. Buchanan

As President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran is compared to Richard Nixon's opening to China, Bibi Netanyahu must know how Chiang Kai-shek felt as he watched his old friend Nixon toasting Mao in Peking.

The Iran nuclear deal is not on the same geostrategic level. Yet both moves, seen as betrayals by old U.S. allies, were born of a cold assessment in Washington of a need to shift policy to reflect new threats and new opportunities.

Several events contributed to the U.S. move toward Tehran.

First was the stunning victory in June 2013 of President Hassan Rouhani, who rode to power on the votes of the Green Revolution that had sought unsuccessfully to oust Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009.

THE GOP'S IRAN DILEMMA
By Patrick J. Buchanan

From first reactions, it appears that Hill Republicans will be near unanimous in voting a resolution of rejection of the Iran nuclear deal.

They will then vote to override President Obama's veto of their resolution. And if the GOP fails there, Gov. Scott Walker says his first act as president would be to kill the deal.

But before the party commits to abrogating the Iran deal in 2017, the GOP should consider whether it would be committing suicide in 2016.

A COMING ERA OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE?
By Patrick J. Buchanan

The Oklahoma Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, has ordered a monument of the Ten Commandments removed from the Capitol.

Calling the Commandments ""religious in nature and an integral part of the Jewish and Christian faiths,"" the court said the monument must go.

Gov. Mary Fallin has refused. And Oklahoma lawmakers instead have filed legislation to let voters cut out of their constitution the specific article the justices invoked. Some legislators want the justices impeached.

Fallin's action seems a harbinger of what is to come in America — an era of civil disobedience like the 1960s, where court orders are defied and laws ignored in the name of conscience and a higher law.
Only this time, the rebellion is likely to arise from the right. (Read the entire article at: http://www.theamericancause.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1203&cntnt01origid=26&cntnt01returnid=29)",,status,,2015-08-07 07:55:01,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

EUROPE'S REAL EXISTENTIAL CRISIS
By Patrick J. Buchanan

However the Greek crisis ends, whether with Athens leaving the Eurozone, or submitting and accepting austerity at the dictates of its creditors, the European Union appears headed for an existential crisis.

Greece borrowed and spent beyond its means, like New York City in the '70s, and Detroit, Illinois, and Puerto Rico today. But the crisis of Europe is about more than budget deficits and bad debts.
All the momentum toward One Europe — the dream of the generation of Jean Monnet that drove Europeans toward ever-deeper union — seems to have dissipated. The momentum is now toward separation and dissolution.

The Greek crisis exposed one fault line in the union, the desire of the Mediterranean nations to build welfare states that their economies could not sustain without huge borrowing abroad.
Paying these debts is going to force ever-greater austerity on those nations. Eventually, their peoples may choose, as debtors do, to walk away, rather than pay.

At the declaration by Donald Trump that he is a candidate for the presidential nomination of the Republican Party, media elites of left and right reacted with amusement, anger and disgust.

Though he has been a hugely successful builder-businessman, far more successful than, say, Carly Fiorina, who has been received respectfully, our resident elites resolutely refuse to take Trump seriously.

BLACK vs. BLUE IN AMERICA

Half a century ago this summer, the Voting Rights Act was passed, propelled by Bloody Sunday at Selma Bridge. The previous summer, the Civil Rights Act became law on July 2.

We are in the 7th year of the presidency of a black American who has named the first two black U.S. attorneys general.

Yet race relations seem more poisonous now than then, when the good will of America's majority was driving legislation.

Today's issue, however, is not voting rights, open housing or school busing. It is black vs. blue: African-Americans inflamed at what they see as chronic police brutality and police forces feeling besieged in a demagogic ""war on cops.""

IMPERIAL OVERREACH
By Patrick J. Buchanan

Toward the end of the presidency of George H.W. Bush, America stood alone at the top of the world — the sole superpower.

After five weeks of ""shock and awe"" and 100 hours of combat, Saddam's army had fled Kuwait back up the road to Basra and Bagdad.

Our Cold War adversary was breaking apart into 15 countries. The Berlin Wall had fallen. Germany was reunited. The captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe were breaking free.

Bush I had mended fences with Beijing after the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square. Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin were friends.

CULTURAL CLEANSING OF CHRISTIAN MALES

By Patrick J. Buchanan

The culture war against Christianity is picking up speed.

Last week came word Saint Louis University will remove a heroic-sized statue of Fr. Pierre-Jean De Smet S.J. from the front of Fusz Hall, where it has stood for 60 years.

The statue depicts Fr. De Smet holding aloft a crucifix as he ministers to two American Indians, one of whom is kneeling.

Historically, the statue is accurate. Fr. De Smet, ""Blackrobe,"" as he was known, was a 19th-century missionary to Indian tribes who converted thousands. A friend of Sitting Bull, he spent his last years in St. Louis.

And as the mission of this Jesuit university is, presumably, to instruct the Catholic young in their faith and send them out into the world to bring the good news of Jesus Christ as Lord and savior to nonbelievers, what exactly is the problem here?

SECULARISTS VS. SUICIDE BOMBERS

By Patrick J. Buchanan

""What apparently happened was that the Iraqi forces just showed no will to fight. ... We can give them training, we can give them equipment; we obviously can't give them the will to fight.""

Thus did Defense Secretary Ash Carter identify the root cause of the rout of the Iraqi army in Ramadi.

Disgusted U.S. military officers say the 1,000 ISIS fighters who overran Ramadi were outnumbered by the defenders 10 to 1.

Why did the Iraqi army run? And what motivated the fighters of ISIS to attack a city whose defenders so vastly outnumbered them?

According to battle reports, the assault began when dozens of captured U.S. armored vehicles and trucks, laden with explosives, were driven by ISIS volunteers to blast huge holes in the defenders' lines.

Why do all the martyrs seem to be on their side? And why is it our side that, all too often, shows ""no will to fight""?

Iraqis are not cowards. From 1980 to 1988, their fathers died in the scores of thousands defending their country against Iran. But if Iraqis would die for dictator Saddam Hussein, why does today's Iraqi army seem reluctant to fight for the democratic Haider al-Abadi?

THE DECLINE OF CHRISTIAN AMERICA

By Patrick J. Buchanan

""This is a Christian nation,"" said the Supreme Court in 1892.

""America was born a Christian nation,"" echoed Woodrow Wilson. Harry Truman affirmed it: ""This is a Christian nation.""

But in 2009, Barack Hussein Obama begged to differ: ""We do not consider ourselves a Christian nation.""

Comes now a Pew Research Center survey that reveals the United States is de-Christianizing at an accelerated rate.

Whereas 86 percent of Americans in 1990 identified as Christians, by 2007, that was down to 78 percent. Today only 7 in 10 say they are Christians. But the percentage of those describing themselves as atheists, agnostics or nonbelievers has risen 

to 23. That exceeds the Catholic population and is only slightly below evangelicals.

Those in the mainline Protestant churches — Presbyterians, Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalians — have plummeted from 50 
percent of the U.S. population in 1958 to 14 percent today. By accommodating the social revolution of the 1960s to stay relevant, mainline churches appear to have made themselves irrelevant to America's young.(Read the entire article at: http://www.theamericancause.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1190&cntnt01origid=26&cntnt01returnid=29)",,status,,2015-06-11 11:51:19,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The fall of Ramadi, capital of Anbar, largest province in Iraq, after a rout of the Iraqi army by a few hundred ISIS fighters using bomb-laden trucks, represents a stunning setback for U.S. policy.

When President Obama declared that we shall ""degrade and defeat"" the Islamic State, he willed the ends, but not the means.

OUR NEXT MIDEAST WAR -- SYRIA

By Patrick J. Buchanan

Jeb Bush has spent the week debating with himself over whether he would have started the war his brother launched on Iraq.

When he figures it out, hopefully, our would-be president will focus in on the campaign to drag us into yet another Mideast war — this time to bring down Bashar Assad's regime in Syria.

While few would mourn the passing of the Assad dynasty, there is a problem: If Assad falls, a slaughter of Christians will follow and the battle for control of Damascus will be between the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, the Nusra Front, and the crazed terrorists of the Islamic State.

Victory for either would be a disaster for America.

Where is the evidence of an unholy alliance to bring this about?

Turkey, which turned a blind eye to ISIS volunteers slipping into Syria, has aided the Nusra Front in setting up its own capital in Idlib, near the Turkish border, to rival the ISIS capital of Raqqa.

In the fall of Idlib, said Bashar Assad, ""the main factor was the huge support that came through Turkey; logistic support, 

and military support, and of course financial support that came through Saudi Arabia and Qatar.""

IS A UK CRACKUP AHEAD?

By Patrick J. Buchanan

David Cameron is the most successful Tory Party leader since Margaret Thatcher.

Yet history may also record that his success led to the crackup of his country, and Great Britain's secession from the 

European Union.

How did Cameron's Tories capture their majority?

First, they compiled a strong record to run on.

More critically, they attacked the Labour Party of Ed Miliband as too far left to govern, and warned that a Labour government 

would be hostage to a secessionist Scottish National Party, without whose votes Miliband could never reach a majority in Parliament.

Labour could not shake off the charge, because it was true.

The attack on the SNP as a subversive party secretly allied with Labour had an ancillary benefit for the Tories. It helped 

produce a SNP sweep of all but three of Scotland's 59 seats. The Labour Party was virtually wiped out in Scotland, its northern bastion.

How Labour recovers from this amputation is hard to see. (Read the entire article at: http://www.theamericancause.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1186&cntnt01origid=26&cntnt01returnid=29)",,status,,2015-06-07 09:45:00,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

ON A FAST TRACK TO NATIONAL RUIN

By Patrick J. Buchanan

In the first quarter of 2015, in the sixth year of the historic Obama recovery, the U.S. economy grew by two-tenths of 1 

percent.

And that probably sugarcoats it.

For trade deficits subtract from the growth of GDP, and the U.S. trade deficit that just came in was a monster.

As the AP's Martin Crutsinger writes, ""The U.S. trade deficit in March swelled to the highest level in more than six years, 

propelled by a flood of imports that may have sapped the U.S. economy of any growth in the first quarter.""

The March deficit was $51.2 billion, largest of any month since 2008. In goods alone, the trade deficit hit $64 billion.

As Crutsinger writes, a surge in imports to $239 billion in March, ""reflected greater shipments of foreign-made industrial 

machinery, autos, mobile phones, clothing and furniture.""

What does this flood of imports of things we once made here mean for a city like, say, Baltimore? Writes columnist Allan 

Brownfeld:

""Baltimore was once a city where tens of thousands of blue collar employees earned a good living in industries building cars, 

airplanes and making steel. ... In 1970, about a third of the labor force in Baltimore was employed in manufacturing. By 

2000, only 7 percent of city residents had manufacturing jobs.""

KILLER COP OR MALICIOUS PROSECUTOR?

By Patrick J. Buchanan

Who killed Freddie Gray?

According to Baltimore prosecutor Marilyn Mosby, Freddie was murdered in a conspiracy of six cops who imprisoned him in a 

police van and there assaulted and killed him.

The killer was African-American officer Caesar Goodson, driver of the van, who, with a ""depraved heart,"" murdered Freddie.

This is a summation of the charges against six Baltimore cops made Friday by Mosby, as she ranted into the TV cameras:

""To the people of Baltimore, and the demonstrators across America: I heard your call for 'No justice, no peace.' ... To the 

youth of this city: I will seek justice on your behalf. ...

""This is your moment. ... You're at the forefront of this cause and as young people, our time is now.""

Mosby has cast herself as the avenging angel of those clamoring for retribution. But unless she has far more evidence than 

has been revealed, Mosby is talking a stronger hand than her cards are showing on the table. (Read the entire article at: http://www.theamericancause.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1181&cntnt01origid=26&cntnt01returnid=29)",,status,,2015-06-05 12:42:00,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

HILLARY BLAMES THE COPS

Had Freddie Gray been robbed, beaten and left to die in the streets of his Baltimore neighborhood, no one would be mourning

No one would be marching for Freddie. No one would be using Freddie as the new poster child of ""Black Lives Matter!""

No one would care, three weeks later, but his family and friends.

It was the manner of his death, suffering a fractured spine in police custody, that makes Freddie matter. For he can now be 

credibly cast in the victim's role in the great new narrative against America — that ours is a society of unequal justice 

where racist cops routinely brutalize black men and boys and are rarely called to account.

Ex-Gov. Mike Huckabee and ex-Sen. Rick Santorum, past winners of the Iowa caucuses, were there. So, too, were Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Scott Walter. Cruz and Walker are sons of Christian preachers.

All nine GOP hopefuls espoused Judeo-Christian values, and all nine pledged unyielding opposition to same-sex marriage.

""At a forum before evangelical Christians,"" wrote The New York Times, ""the Republican candidates told a cheering crowd that the fight over same-sex marriage would not end with a Supreme Court decision.

This week, Congress takes up legislation to cede His Majesty full authority to negotiate the largest trade deal in history, the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, and to surrender Congress' right to amend any TPP that Obama might bring home.

A U.S.-RUSSIA WAR OVER UKRAINE?

By Patrick J. Buchanan

""Could a U.S. response to Russia's action in Ukraine provoke a confrontation that leads to a U.S.-Russia War?""

This jolting question is raised by Graham Allison and Dimitri Simes in the cover article of The National Interest.

The answer the authors give, in ""Countdown to War: The Coming U.S. Russia Conflict,"" is that the odds are shortening on a military collision between the world's largest nuclear powers.

The cockpit of the conflict, should it come, will be Ukraine. (Read the entire article at: http://www.theamericancause.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=1180&cntnt01origid=26&cntnt01returnid=29)",,status,,2015-04-30 10:33:00,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

""Pat, sometimes it seems like our friends want me to go over the cliff with flags flying,"" President Reagan once told me.

STAND UP FOR INDIANA

By Patrick J. Buchanan

In what has been called the ""Catholic moment"" in America, in the late 1940s and 1950s, Catholics were admonished from pulpits to ""live the faith"" and ""set an example"" for others.

Public lives were to reflect moral beliefs. Christians were to avoid those ""living in sin."" Christians who operated motels and hotels did not rent rooms to unmarried couples.

Fast forward to 21st-century America.

Indiana just enacted a law, as have 19 other states, to protect the rights of religious people to practice their beliefs in how they live their lives and conduct their businesses.

The president's request for the authorization to use military force against the Islamic State has landed in a Congress as divided as the country.

That division was mirrored in the disparate receptions Obama's resolution received from The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.

To the Times, Obama's AUMF is ""alarmingly broad. It does not limit the battlefield to Syria and Iraq.""

Moreover, Obama ""seeks permission to attack 'associated persons or forces.'""

In crises over Berlin in 1948 and 1961, the Hungarian Revolution in 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Prague in 1968, U.S. forces in Europe stayed in their barracks.

We saw the Elbe as Moscow's red line, and they saw it as ours.
