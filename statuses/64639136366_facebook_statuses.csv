The other sees such things as expedient means to an end, and written words hold little significance and can be violated at will. It's an all-but-unbridgeable divide between those who deem life and land to be sacred, and those who hold sacred only that which feeds their greed, power and control. Both sides are perplexed by the other's motivations. Reduced to its essence, it's a clash between those who are moral and those who are immoral, and it's a perpetual argument over core issues of human dishonesty and truthfulness, disrespect and respect, dishonor and honor, justice and injustice. The question in the upcoming election is whether American voters are prepared to make a reasoned choice about which side of that argument the next president will take.","Indian Treaties, Oil Pipelines and Presidential Elections: A Tale of Lies, Deception and Hypocrisy",link,http://tdig.it/2e7Glej,2016-10-11 19:28:31,254,12,265,188,2,3,0,22,39

64639136366_10153620791836367,"The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, 
begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. 
Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it.
Through violence you may murder the liar, 
but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. 
Through violence you may murder the hater, 
but you do not murder hate. 
In fact, violence merely increases hate. 
So it goes. 
Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, 
adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. 
Darkness cannot drive out darkness: 
only light can do that. 
Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.
