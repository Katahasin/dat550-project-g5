160712560629690_964446643589607,"""I've toyed with the idea of boycotting the Cowboys, my life-long team, and supporting another team. Over the past several years, I've become a fan of the Seahawks' brashness and social consciousness, and of course I was ecstatic when they beat the team that took the Cowboys out of the playoffs last year. And since I already cheer for Seattle's other football team (their soccer team, that is), it'd be a natural progression to cheer for their NFL team too.

But part of me wonders if simply switching allegiances makes a damn bit of difference. After all, the NFL itself, the power structure that every team in the league is beholden to, is hardly guilt-free. After coming under fire last year for the handling of the Ray Rice situation, there was heightened scrutiny on the league's handling of domestic violence issues, with many stating that the league's actions were empty. And it's not like Hardy is the only alleged abuser in the NFL (or even the only one playing for the Cowboys). Does cheering for another team matter when the entire structure needs to be burnt to the ground?""",#BoycottNFL?: One Feminist NFL Fan's Moral Dilemma,link,http://skepchick.org/2015/03/boycottnfl-one-feminist-nfl-fans-moral-dilemma/,2015-03-30 15:14:17,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0
