I don't care where someone is coming from- it is completely irresponsible and dereliction of duty for our government to ignore doing their responsibility in defending and keeping the citizens of this country safe by allowing mass entries of un-vetted refugees. I understand that there is a difference in refugees and regular immigrants, yet in the world we live in, no matter how much a large population of fools would like to believe otherwise, Islam is still at war with the world, they've never said or proven otherwise, and to allow a majority of military aged men of Islamic background and nations to come here unvetted-when there are women and children of Christian background who are fleeing muslim nations, is the most insane thing possible.

174133289343084_1196609990428737,"From PolitiChicks CEO/Publisher Ann-Marie Murrell:  

The night before the elections Morgan Brittany & I were repeatedly asked by the left-leaning tv show we were on if ""angry Trump supporters"" would protest & riot in the streets if he lost. We said nope. They asked us repeatedly in different ways, and we said NO. We're not the ones who do that stuff--the other side does. During Obama's reign they started with the Occupy Wall Street movement, then graduated to full-on rioting in Ferguson, and then other cities, burning buildings, destroying their own neighborhoods. Then we began seeing a horrific rise in police officers being assassinated, including the past week. All of this was the result of 8 years of misguided/dangerous leadership, emboldening people to take their anger to the streets.

But perhaps just as dangerous is what the media is doing right this moment. They are very efficiently, and dangerously, banging their war drums, telling the world that all Republicans are racist/white nationalists (whether you're white or not). They are telling people to be very afraid. Even good ol' Dan Rather, that bastion of fake ""unbiasedness"", is working triple-time to perpetuate that fear. Over at NPR, all of their best quiet talkers are using their quiet words to quietly paint a picture of horror among all the folks out there who don't get out much and believe whatever NPR tells them to believe...

Basically what every single ""real news"" organization is blasting to the universe is that the new Donald Trump presidency is entirely made up of KKK members and neo-Nazis. Not just a few hundred crazies--but all of them. Right now, every network is not-so-subtly insinuating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is out to hurt/maim people. So they are not-so-subtly suggesting people fight back.

In other words, the powerful people behind the Democrat Party are very, very angry again--like post-Civil War angry, when Democrats were furious at Republican President Lincoln for freeing the slaves. Or pre-Civil Rights angry, when Democrats realized the Republicans were going to win that battle, too. Today's Democrats are doing what they do best--bullying & using scare tactics to confuse/trick people into rioting, or worse. So my advice is to keep talking to family and friends, reassure people who are buying the hype, and keep praying for our nation. A-M",,status,,2016-11-23 11:10:43,126,12,51,112,8,0,0,1,5

There's a giant hole next to the Midnight Mission where Hell has broken through and taken refuge in tents and wayward children.

In a completely non-political way, Maureen personally recognizes the potential danger signs and symptoms in Hillary, who sometimes seems to  be struggling to stay upright.  Maureen writes, ""My history of neurological damage began with a complication from a craniotomy surgery in 1986.  Subsequently I have had over three dozen operations over the course of twenty-five years, each one to correct some damage done by the last.  With Ms. Clinton, I see danger signs and I see them being hidden by a group of people who do not have the safety of America first and foremost in their minds.  Most especially Clinton herself, who seems to be putting her lifelong ambition of becoming the first woman President above the security of America and her citizens. Clinton has already demonstrated her carelessness with National Security, so is it really so much of a stretch to believe she will do anything in order to make it to November, then hide away till January 2017 for the historic swearing-in?""

174133289343084_1097133467043057,"From PolitiChicks CEO/editor Ann-Marie Murrell:  

""Last year after speaking at an event in Oklahoma, my sweet OK PolitiChick Julia Seay was driving me to the airport when I got a call from filmmaker/producer Ann McElhinney.  Ann said my international film and television star friend, Nick Searcy, told her I was in Oklahoma and wanted me to appear as a 'Reporter' in the 'Gosnell Movie' Nick was directing.  I told Ann I was literally on my way to the airport but she told me I could NOT say no and told me Nick was calling next.  Of course no one is allowed to say 'no' to an international film and television star...So Julia turned her car around and I ended up staying 2 extra days.  Filming was great, and besides hanging out with Julia and Paul Seay I also got to spend time with some of my favorite people in the world--Nick, Ann, AlfonZo Rachel, Dean Cain (""Superman""), and my buddy Brooke McGowan even came down for the shoot.   

These days the million dollar question I get asked all the time is: WHEN IS THE GOSNELL MOVIE COMING OUT? Answer is, I have no idea - but I'm personally hoping it's before the elections, to remind voters that whatever ""good"" things Planned Parenthood does for women, there's a lot more bad. And who doesn't like a serial killer movie??  

So for any MOVIE DISTRIBUTORS out there who might like to tap into  the enormous conservative base that's dying to spend their money on good films for a change, talk to Ann McElhinney & Phelim McAleer. (And if don't believe we like to spend our money, ask Dinesh D'Souza.)

174133289343084_1092679010821836,"Heads up folks. Now that Dinesh D'Souza's film Hillary's America is in theaters this weekend, be on the lookout for any type of sabotage. Our activist friend Babette Holder posted the following --if you experience/hear of anything like this in your theater, please either ask to speak to the theater's MANAGER or post it on YELP. As Babette later wrote, this has nothing to do with trying to deny freedom of speech or expression for regular moviegoers--but when a theater tries to deliberately HIDE a movie from those theater goers, that's the problem:

""Something to be aware of and to really get your anger up over: I had a friend ask me the other night if I wanted to go see the movie, Hillary's America. I had to decline because I was under a time crunch for a project. So they went, and later I got a phone call from them, mind you this is the premiere day of the movie. They get to the theater with several other's and they are looking at the marquees for the movie and it's not on either marquees (this is one of those megaplex theaters). One of them asked at the ticket booth if they were showing the movie as it stated on the internet and the ticket guy replies, ""Unfortunately yes."" Friends:.....speechless at his answer and the way he delivered his answer, so then my friends asked him if they could have 3 tickets and to confirm that the next showing was in 15 minutes. Ticket guy, ""yes it starts in 15 mins, but I wouldn't waste my time on that trash."" Friends, give us 3 tickets. They got their tickets, so they are standing in the lobby trying to decide what they wanted for snacks and they overhear a couple that are disappointed the theater wasn't showing the Hillary's America movie. Long story short, this couple ended up buying tickets to another movie as the folks at the ticket booth didn't bother to tell them the movie was being shown at that theater, and perhaps they didn't ask to confirm or perhaps they were mislead by any one of the ticket agents at either booth location as some of them don't bother to check if they don't see it listed themselves, after all it's just a job and don't go above and beyond with some these days. So my friends informed them that the movie was indeed being shown and to go get their tickets exchanged which they did. Folks I know this theater well and there is NO reason they don't get the title's up in time. NO reason except the management didn't agree with the movie period! The manager was salty according to my friends with having to switch out the tickets and by the way, other movie goers were heard being disappointed the movie wasn't shown. I wish I had the time to go now, because y'all know me, I would have videoed it all for record.""

""My nephew, Zack, is of my favorite human beings on earth.  A few years ago Zack received his is Associate Arts degree & tomorrow he receives his Bachelor's & will soon be a Special Ed teacher.  I'm so proud of him I can barely breathe and you will be, too, when you read the attached article he wrote for PolitiChicks a few years ago.  The following is from his mama, my sister, Carrington Pennyweather:  

'Tomorrow morning my son will graduate at the top of his class from Letourneau University. When Zack was three years old he could only communicate by repeating back exactly what you had said to him. I remember so many days and nights when I would just cover my mouth with my hands and cry and cry as quietly as possible because I had no idea how to help him, how to break through. Zack knew the alphabet when he was 12 months old. He could draw pictures of people and write words by the age of 2, but if you asked him, ""Zack, do you want a glass of milk?"" he would simply look at you and smile and say ""Zack, do you want a glass of milk?"" It was heartbreaking. However there were two things that I knew for certain. My son was extremely happy, and my son was incredibly smart. Not being very bright myself, I decided the most important thing I could do for him was to keep him happy. And BELIEVE in him. I'm often asked about how I've been able to get Zack this far. The answer is quite simple. I didn't . He did it all. No one has pushed themselves more than my son. In school when he was being bullied, I would automatically want to seek vengence like something you would see in one of the Godfather movies, he alone decided it was more on the bully than him and therefore never let them take away his self confidence. He has surprised me and surprised me every step of the way. From his work ethic, to his ability to pass college algebra (I failed 3rd grade math for gosh sakes and was considered ""normal"".. and no...I don't need any comments about how wrong of a statement that is thank you very much) to his time spent the past year student teaching. Last night Zack was talking to me about job opportunities and apartments in the Dallas area and how quickly he wants to get out on his own.. and I was frantically trying my best to temper his enthusiasm with practical reasoning and basic ""I'm terrified and you can't leave"" observations. Zack came and sat down beside me and took my hand and said ""Mom, it's time for me to make up my own mind and do the things I planned on, and you just have to trust that I know what I'm doing, because I really do."" And I knew. I knew that I had to let him go. I knew that whatever he did up to this point and whatever I did for him up to this point had finally reached the end of the road. I realized that I had been needing to hear him say those very words. From that sweet little boy who could never communicate with me, he had become a truly remarkable young man who had communicated exactly what he wanted to do with his life. I went into my room, covered my mouth with my hands cried and cried...I had never been so proud of him in my entire life.'""",Guest Writer Zack Zanardi: My Autism (Or How I Learned To Be Me) » Politichicks.com,link,http://politichicks.com/2015/08/guest-writer-zack-zanardi-autism-learned/,2016-05-06 13:50:56,43,1,22,39,4,0,0,0,0

And it has a huge head and a small body. That's changing. It's been changing for decades. But the country doesn't have decades. So neither do conservatives. Conservatives did achieve key goals. They pushed Congress to the right. They hurt the establishment. Conservatives had managed to rally an opposition, while vastly overestimating their ability to set the larger agenda. This is a setback, not a curtain call for the movement. And setbacks are a learning opportunity. A conservatism disconnected from actual people is never going to mean anything. Unpopular policies are a self-evident dead end. And organizing an opposition is not the same thing as proving you have the right to replace the thing you're opposing. Among other things, that means cleaning house and having less tolerance for scandals and corruption. It also means becoming less dependent on non-conservative populist acts that blow with the wind to convey conservative messages. Conservatives have revolutionary ideas. But they let the opportunity at building a revolution slip away leaving behind a dissatisfied base. That mistake cannot and should not be made a second time.""

What is new is his being supranationalist on the one hand and isolationist on the other. He has often defined himself as a man absolved of ideology, a pragmatist who will do whatever is necessary under the circumstances. Necessary for what? Necessary to achieve a certain goal, which, in his case, has been purely ideological. What is more, he is discordant and ambivalent to the very core. War calls for intervention: you must win the war first, then negotiate the peace. What is more, you cannot change venue. Very rarely can you choose the terrain.""

And before more of you claim Germans didn't take away guns, here's a bit more clarification from a few of our readers: 

Jayme Secrist Sedgwick: ""Bernard E. Harcourt, writing for the University of Chicago Law School and Political Science Department, notes: 
If you read the 1938 Nazi gun laws closely and compare them to earlier 1928 Weimar gun legislation – as a straightforward exercise of statutory interpretation – several conclusions become clear. First, with regard to possession and carrying of firearms, the Nazi regime relaxed the gun laws that were in place in Germany at the time the Nazis seized power. Second, the Nazi gun laws of 1938 specifically banned Jewish persons from obtaining a license to manufacture firearms or ammunition. Third, approximately eight months after enacting the 1938 Nazi gun laws, Hitler imposed regulations prohibiting Jewish persons from possessing any dangerous weapons, including firearms."" 

Aaron Schwartzbart:  ""Adolph Hitler convinced otherwise right-thinking people to kill 6M Jews.  Two of his most important tools in this endeavor were propaganda and gun control.  I implore Americans from every walk of life to deal honestly with history.""

Pamela Morgan Smith:  ""And not just Jews, but other 'undesireables' - blacks, gypsies, homesexuals; anyone not Aryan...People who ignore history are destined to repeat it.""

The United States is the fourth most popular country for ISIS tweeters. The UK is in the top ten. The State Department is offering a $25 million reward for Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current head of Al Qaeda and the man behind its ideology, but he visited mosques in California on a fundraising trip during the Clinton era. Abu Musab al-Suri, another key Al Qaeda ideologue, operated out of Spain. Anwar al-Awlaki lived comfortably in the United States until he was ready to step into a global role.

""So many of us have been saying in articles, radio, and television that the COWARDS of Islam only attack WEAKNESS.  At the end of 4 years of Jimmy Carter's weak presidency, Islamists were emboldened to take Americans hostage in Iran and only the strength of Reagan scared them into submission.  After 8 years of Bill Clinton playing footsie with interns in DC and his imbecilic footsie playing with weapons inspectors in Iraq, America was attacked at the end of Clinton's presidency.  

Now, the emboldened Islamists have seen how weak France is after they openly allowed them to invade their country, generously giving Islamists entire sections of their cities and towns.  Sadly, France has learned the hardest way  that their generosity & good will was never enough for Islamists.  It never has been, never will be enough since the very beginning when their prophet told them to CONQUER all lands.  

I pray that America takes great heed---because once again, after almost 8 years of one of the weakest presidencies in American history, Islamists are probably emboldened, once again, to strike us as well.  And prayers for France--for the hostages, for the families of the victims, and for the brave officers trying to fight the terrorists as I write this message right now.""",,status,,2015-11-13 19:27:41,469,22,182,469,0,0,0,0,0

A functional nation can be free, but an ideal state must be totalitarian no matter how often it prates about freedom. A nation can only be free when it accepts human flaws and frailties. An ideal state loves freedom, but hates free people. It cannot accept individualism or the wisdom of crowds. It bends them to its ideal. The only way to escape the tyranny of idealism is for a nation to accept its flaws.
Once a people become susceptible to the tyranny of idealism, they begin to accept that their lives are conditional on the fulfillment of a set of ideals. And that they can therefore be sacrificed to them.""

And we even have 'boots on the ground'---our own PolitiChick Morgan Brittany is taking one for the team, reporting LIVE from Vegas!  The debate kickoff is at 8:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, October 13, from Las Vegas. You can watch it on CNN or at CNNgo.

A few things to watch for:  

1. Keep an eye on Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. For all the non-monstrous Democrats in America who don't want to vote for a criminal (Hillary) or a socialist (Sanders), Jim Webb is the 'moderate' old-school Democrat. He's pro-military/veteran and he might be the surprise of the night--ala Carly Fiorina, who most people didn't know anything about until after the debates. OR he'll sink. After all, he IS a Democrat...

Ostensibly aimed at preventing the country from gaining nuclear weapons, it seeks to accomplish this goal by giving almost total control of inspections and oversight of the handling of fissile materials to the very people who are suspect. Iran can essentially arrange its own inspections, say everything is in order, and little recourse exists to officially question their assertions. And in return for this ""concession"", Iran enjoys wide-ranging easement of economic sanctions that had rightly been levied against it for its provocative attempts at nuclear development. This will result in a financial boom for the Iranian government – which will serve only to help, not hinder, its evil ambitions.

We can't make it go away by overthrowing Assad or supporting him, by giving out candy or taking in refugees. This conflict is in the cultural DNA of Islam. It is not going anywhere.

This war is not our fault. It is their fault.

There are Christian and non-Muslim minorities who are genuine refugees, but the two Muslim sects whose militias are murdering each other are not victims, they are perpetrators. Just because Sunnis are running from a Shiite militia or Shiites from a Sunni militia right now doesn't make them victims.  The moment that their side's militia wins and begins slaughtering the other side, the oppressed will become the oppressors. Such shifts have already taken place countless times in this conflict.

The refugees aren't fleeing a dictator, they're fleeing each other while carrying the hateful ideologies that caused this bloodshed with them.  We aren't taking in people fleeing the civil war. We're taking in their civil war and giving it a good home.""

174133289343084_918766508213088,"From PolitiChicks CEO Ann-Marie Murrell:  

""Most of my friends & family already know this about me and I may lose a few FB friends writing this, but I wrote basically the same thing in our book 'What Women Really Want', Chapter 1, 'When the Lights Came On'. (I recommend reading to the end before un-friending me...)   

On September 10, 2001, I was a naive Democrat.  Back then, I believed there could be ""peace on earth good will toward Man"" if only everyone would lay down their weapons and love one another.  In my lifetime there had been no major strikes on America so I didn't see the need to spend billions on our military (especially when so many people were hungry and homeless...).  Besides, who would want to hurt us?  We were a loving, giving country filled with beautiful people!  But all that changed the next day on 9/11 when I saw commercial airplanes fly into both civilian and government buildings, killing thousands of innocent Americans. The same day I watched people in the Middle East dancing and celebrating in their streets, believing their god had directed this horrific assault on our country.  In that instant, I understood as long as people want to kill us simply because we exist there can never be ""peace on earth.""  I understood the need for a strong military, and everything else I had questioned and/or ignored in the past became crystal clear.  

Fourteen years ago tomorrow, 9/12/2001, I left the Democrat Party and became a Republican.  The reason I fight as hard as I do is because I can clearly see that naive, ""dark side"" of America and those who refuse to see  Truth and Light.  I see that darkness in Democrats and, sadly, I see it in many of our ""Republican"" leaders who are more Democrat than I used to be.  Today, as I mourn with the rest of the world for the thousands who were brutally murdered on both 9/11/01 and 9/11/12, I realize it was unfortunate that it took such a tragedy to open my eyes and see the light. It's not an easy thing to admit--so publicly--to being so very wrong...But the thing about the light, once you've seen it, you can never go back to the darkness again.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/politichicks/photos/a.190664381023308.45021.174133289343084/918766508213088/?type=3,2015-09-11 15:00:00,543,65,133,543,0,0,0,0,0

No one is talking about how big Iran's military budget is, but debating how small it is. And how small is it?  Iran's military is at over 500,000 in strength. The Basji militia claims to be able to mobilize millions more. It has a nuclear weapons program and some of the most advanced indigenously developed weapons programs in the region. Iran is currently involved in wars in Syria and Iraq. Its proxy armies have carved up Lebanon and Yemen, and are slavering over Bahrain.  Not bad for $15 billion or $30 billion or whatever Obama is claiming it is this week.  Of course Iran's budget isn't $15 or $30 billion. It spent $11 billion on the Bushehr reactor alone. Its nuclear program cost upward of $100 billion. Obama's deal requires him to claim that the program is peaceful, but who really believes that a country sitting on a mountain of gas and oil blew that much money just to lower the cost of electricity a little bit?

Obama has told many lies about his Iran deal. But this is more than just another lie. Minimizing Iran's military spending to make it look as harmless as possible endangers American national security. There are already reports that Obama worked to tamper with ISIS intelligence materials to make the terror group look weak. It was his insistence that ISIS was only a jayvee team that let it take over cities. Now he wants to convince Americans that Iran is just another jayvee team we shouldn't take seriously. Pay no attention to the nukes or the worldwide terror rings...""

174133289343084_898415186914887,"From PolitiChicks CEO/Editor-in-Chief Ann-Marie Murrell:  

""I feel blessed to have witnessed what felt like an important part of history today, and in Beverly Hills, California no less. My husband & I went to an Iranian Synagogue for Shabbat Services with guest speakers Rabbi Schmuley Boteach and Senator Ted Cruz and it was one of the most powerful messages I've heard from anyone, maybe in my life.

Rabbi Boteach opened with a call to ACTION, urging congregants to be united in speaking out and to be courageous in spreading the TRUTH. His message is what every church & synagogue in America should be shouting from the rafters because this is no longer 'simply politics' . As Rabbi Boteach said, the Iranian deal & the insanity surrounding it has made getting involved a matter of life and death--and because most of the congregation of Nessah Synagogue were Iranian Jews, they understood this more than most. When introducing Sen. Cruz, he talked about how Cruz has often risked his career by taking a few ""roads less popular"" & commended him for continuously speaking out for the people instead of the #WashingtonCartel. The Rabbi also mentioned work Sen. Cruz has done both publicly & ""quietly, behind the scenes"" for Israel.

In turn, Senator Cruz spoke of his love and respect for Israel and pledged to fight the Iranian deal with everything he has. He talked about how difficult it is to sometimes have to stand alone when others are afraid to get involved, and the firestorm he's had to endure because of this (not only by the press but also by the 'Washington Cartel'). But he pledged he will continue to shine the ""burning light of truth"" no matter what. Throughout his speech, he was given multiple standing ovations and at the end all the men sang a joyous Hebrew song. No idea what it was or what it meant but I so wanted to join in lol--it was simply breathtaking.

Out of respect no one was allowed to take pictures or videotape so the reporter in me almost had to sit on my hands not to transcribe everything; but I was just happy to have been there with some of the finest people in California. Again, I felt completely blessed to have witnessed such an event. My favorite American president is George Washington & after all the damage done by these Socialist-communist-leaing Democrats, I'm convinced America needs a General-esque president in 2016 to lead us out of this mess. Cruz may not be an ""actual"" general, but WOW, if we were in a battle, I would certainly feel safe with someone like him leading the way. Especially if he has LTC Allen West & Rep. Louie Gohmert & Carly Fiorina etc. beside him. No more going along to get along. We need fearless leaders willing & able to fight, and who can be a shining example to others who aren't sure how.

That doesn't mean moving to the ""right"" of Trump. It means connecting with people at a deeper level than just the rhetoric. It means doing more than retelling their own compelling personal stories.

People need someone to fight for them. They need more from a politician than a great story. They need the feeling that the politician will do everything he can to fight for their way of life.  If they want to win, they are going to have to silence their inner lawyer, shut down some of the skills they learned as politicians, and learn to project what their audience is feeling. A good politician knows what you want to hear. A good salesman knows what you want to feel.  Trump isn't fighting this as a battle of ideas or policies. He's talking about what people feel.""

If the leftists don't like our candidates, we can't like them either.  If the leftists don't want us talking social issues, we'll stop.  If the leftists don't like us talking about immigration, we do what they tell us to do.  If the leftists don't like…you get the point.

People who knew America is not perfect but were fiercely proud of their country. It was a melting pot, where people appreciated each other's culture while at the same time integrating and embracing the unique greatness of America, where everyone was free to worship or not, free to think and speak and free to dream the American Dream.

""We're getting lots of comments on our page & in our mailbox today about how the Republican Party is the party of ""corporations & white people"" & the Dem. Party is all about ""minorities"".  So we thought it'd be a good time to post a reminder of what the GOP platform is & has always been about, via Republican President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.  Notice Pres. Lincoln didn't say ""people of color"" or ""minorities"" but instead he said ""ALL MEN are created equal.""  That's the difference--or lack thereof--today, folks:  Democrats have maintained their original Party platform, continuing their efforts to perpetuate segregation & discrimination while Republicans continue trying, as they did before, during, & after the Civil War, to make sure ALL MEN are treated equally. Not just a few, and not any particular race, creed, or color.  ALL.  Here's what GOP Pres. Lincoln said in full:    

""Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""",,status,,2015-07-13 17:24:23,213,19,56,213,0,0,0,0,0

By the way--I have a few things to say about lists like this (including our own annual PolitiChicks 'hot list' which is coming soon). 

Most people--myself included--have insecurities & self-doubt, especially when held under public scrutiny. I've been called every name in the book (and a few that aren't in there yet) by people literally all over the world, and I've been ridiculed for everything from my beliefs & my looks to the way I talk. I wrote about this in our book 'What Women Really Want', including direct quotes from people (inc. one guy who said I had more bags under my eyes than Rodney Dangerfield). Recently someone posted that 'no amount of spray tan can hide how badly Ann-Marie Murrell is aging' lol...So because I know the people who choose this list & what they're looking for (aka beyond the surface) I take this for what it is, a very nice compliment & reminds me to always try to be my very best--both inside & out.

The idea that Islamic violence stems from its beliefs is denounced as racist.""

""I've been saying this for over a year--IF Hillary were to be the Democrat nominee, why aren't the 'powers that be' protecting her?  If the NY Times wanted Hillary as president, they would never ""leak"" info about her--if anything, they would either suppress or squash any potentially damaging stories about her.  Instead, they're breaking stories even our side doesn't know about.  And if Saturday Night Live wanted Hillary as president, they would NOT portray her as the crazy, elitist, out of touch nutcase they're currently portraying her as.  Instead they would characterize her the way they do Pelosi & Obama, as frontmen to the 'crazy rightwing lunatics' they despise so much.  IF Hillary were the DNC's choice, the only things we'd see/hear/read about in the DNC-owned mainstream press would be positive praises--not this.  Remember--everyone believed Hillary would win the nomination in 2008, too, but seemingly out of nowhere came Barack Obama.  Of course he did NOT come ""out of nowhere""--he was being groomed & coached in the background to enter the ring exactly as he did & Hillary was blindsided.  The same thing will happen again; the same DNC people who didn't want Hillary in 2008 certainly don't want her in 2016 after all the insane press she's received--mostly from HER OWN SIDE.  So let's keep an eye out for the seemingly unknown, the potential candidates in the background who are quietly being groomed & coached somewhere in the wings--because mark my words, it will NOT be Hillary in 2016.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/politichicks/photos/a.190664381023308.45021.174133289343084/866664730089933/?type=3,2015-05-31 12:31:32,51,10,8,51,0,0,0,0,0

And if Islam isn't a religion of peace, then the media has been irresponsibly lying to us and the cartoonists have been risking their lives to warn us of that lie.  The talking heads on the television insist that the cartoon contest was irresponsible because there were bound to be ""some crazies"" who would ""take the bait"". But if Islam is no more violent than any other religion, shouldn't it be just as statistically likely that some Christian or Jewish crazies would attack one of the art exhibits, plays or musicals ridiculing and blaspheming against their religions?  Weren't museums and galleries exhibiting ""works of art"" like Piss Christ or Shekhina provoking and baiting those Jewish and Christian crazies? And since there are more Christians than Muslims in America, isn't it statistically far more likely that there should have been far more Christian terror attacks targeting blasphemous exhibits?

Later in the day administrators told the 18 year old  it was a safety violation. Peyton came out to his truck at the end of the school day to find that an administrator had gone to his vehicle and removed the bolts that held the flag safely in place, and placed the flag on the bed of his truck.  In response to the schools position, students rallied around Peyton that evening and vowed to drive to school on Thursday with their flags flying on their own cars.

Here's a great Amazon review by Tom Lehner:  

""Being a single man, growing up in the 70's and 80's in a mostly female household with feminist tendencies, I have accomplished many things except one – understanding what women really want.

One gets permanently contradicting statements and signals. Claiming that they want a real masculine man on one hand demanding independency from man on the other, being over sexualized on TV and movie with no-holds-back whatsoever and at the same time wanting to be recognized for their brains. It is not easy for a man these days to understand women and the usual ""ideological"" motivated guidebooks are not worth a dime.

This book is different, as it comes from women who themselves uphold the principals of traditional values of family first, homeschool like Dr. Loudon, having supported their husbands careers and still are outspoken, intelligent, and stand with both feet full in life and successful themselves.

It reads easy, and once you start reading it you don't want to lay it away (I read it on an 11 hour flight at once). This book gives you an insight of the true mindset of women without making you feel emasculated.

What makes this book special is that it is not written by ivory-tower intellectuals or radical politically motivated authors – NO it is written by women who hold both sides in their hearts, the traditional values of family and making a career on their own.

With every word you read you experience the compassion and honesty and the deep insight those women can give. This book does not need ""tips"" and ""tricks"", simple by reading what these women tell you, you might finally get an insight in a woman's mindset.

If you are married and don't understand what your wife wants, this book will finally help you, and if you are single and have a hard time getting through the double mixed signals this book shows you what women really think.

My grandfather always taught me: ""Boy you will never understand women just love them"" – he never read this book.

I totally recommend this book to all man and of course to all women.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/politichicks/photos/a.190664381023308.45021.174133289343084/857382217684851/?type=3,2015-05-13 10:58:09,25,1,4,25,0,0,0,0,0

And the concept of guarding free speech so as not to provoke anyone is imbecilic. If that's the case, shouldn't people like Bill Maher and Michael Moore fear being shot for speaking provocatively? And are we not RACISTS to assume that Muslims are such out of control, barbaric monsters that they can't handle an event featuring CARTOONS without planning a terror attack?? (If you have any doubts about this, please re-read that sentence for its absurdness...)

Bottom line, America was, once again, attacked by Islamic terrorists. And, once again, instead of defending our ability to speak freely--ensuring WE don't turn into a censored, backwards 3rd world country--many people are defending Islamic terrorists!

And the Obama Inquisition is relentless in ferreting out even the mildest inquiring eyebrow of heresy.  Nobody knows what is in Obama's head except the man himself and his team of psychiatrists.
