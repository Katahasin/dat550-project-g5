The girls have said that the house where they were kept was in a GRA in Gwoza. So, it is easy for the government, if they want or care, to find out who it was. These young girls do not know who is who before their abduction.

Which GRA in Borno was Kabiru Sokoto housed and apprehended again? That is a question that demands some answers.

So, the question is at whose home were the girls kept and whoever kept them knew about their kidnapping.

The politician that kept the girls in his home must have arranged their abduction.

The politician also knew the Boko haram members well for them to have worked with him in secrecy. He also knew the members so well that he worked with them to arrange the kidnapping with them

So, all this while when many accused some Northern politicians of complicity in Boko haram and the girl's abductions, were those accusations indeed right?

1690703604505977_1800449590198044,"This is a Keynote Speech by Professor Patrick L.O. Lumumba at the Third Anti-Corruption Convention that was held in Uganda. He is a Kenyan and a lawyer. 

This speech is to challenge you as a Nigerian and as an African.

""Corruption is something that we talk about. It is something that we complain about. It is something whose negative impact we recognize. It is something that even the corrupt acknowledge it's a bad thing. But the irony and the tragedy at once is that those who engage in corruption love it. The tragedy at once is that those of us who do not engage in it directly accommodate it. Our levels of tolerance for corruption in Africa is amazing. A long time ago, a great Greek philosopher said that it is in the nature of man to hang the small thieves and to elect the great ones to public office. We do that in Uganda, we do that in Kenya, we do that in Tanzania, we do that in Africa. And that is why Africa remains the poorest continent on earth. 

I was, this morning, re-reading a book which I commend to you. Book written by young Zambian economist called Dambisa Moyo. The book called 'Dead Aid'. And in the introduction in that book, there is a note which was found in the bodies of two young Guineans who died while trying to run away from Africa. Today, many young Africans are running away. Not so long ago, about four weeks to be exact, three hundred young Africans drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in Lampedusa because they were running away from Africaâ€¦

When you look at Africa today, whether you are looking at Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria or indeed any country in Africa. Our richest men and women are the men and women who occupy public office. We live in a continent where we celebrate thieves and vilify good men and women. That is the tragedy of Africa. While every other continent in the recent past has moved in the right direction, Africa still remains in the words of Tony Blair as 'the scar in the conscience of humanity'. We live in a continent today, whereas the young man upsurges our young women are born attaining puberty cannot afford sanitary pads but our public servants have ipad which they do not know how to use. We live in a continent today, where our leaders who preside over our health sectors have no faith in the health sector. When they are sick and their families are sick they run away to seek treatment in Germany, in France, in the United Kingdom, in South Africa and India. Even our health ministers don't have faith in our health departments. We live in a country and countries today, where the political leadership has no faith in the education sector. They bring unto us what they call free primary education or universal primary education but they can never dare take their children to those schools. We live in countries where we claim that agriculture is the backbone of our societies but we do not use technology to produce crops. Africans are dying younger than they were dying fifty years ago. We live in a country where Africans would energetically seek to amend the statutes of Rome while there is war in Mali, while there is war in Mauritania, while there is no peace in Somalia, while there is no rest in Eretria. Africa is a tragic continent. And I want to submit to you, that corruption is the source of all these.

For some reason a reason that I do not understand, Africans still engage in 'Primitive Accumulation'. Many Africans, particularly those in public service, will never rest until they have homes in different capitals in the world which they will never live in. They have cars which they will never drive. They have beds of gold which they never sleep on because they never sleep anyway. They buy food which they cannot eat because they long lost their appetites. We live in sour times. I have the privilege of serving as the director of Kenyan anti-corruption Commission. But it would appear that I do not understand my brief well. Upon being appointed I assumed that my mandate was to go out there and fight the corrupt but the truth was that I was not supposed to fight corruption I was supposed to appear to be fighting corruption. Immediately I and my team tried to fight corruption, the parliamentarians in their wisdom and in my own view in their lack of wisdom used the occasion of the amendment of the law to disband the organization and to send myself and my four directors out of office. The history of anti-corruption crusaders in Africa is one and the same. Their mortality rate in office is very short. Before I was victimized, before my victimization, Nuhu Ribadu before me had been victimized in Nigeria. Before I was victimized, McCarty had been victimized in South Africa and the scorpions disbanded. Before I was victimized my equivalent in Malawi had been victimized. Before I'd been victimized, my equivalent in Zambia had been victimized. It would appear that in Africa that if you served your full term you have refused to fight corruption.",,status,,2016-10-25 02:49:57,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0

1.Having received results from our agents at approximately 1800 of the 2627 polling units spread across the 192 Wards in the 18 Local Government Areas of Edo State, we can confirm that our party has attained a near unassailable lead in the Edo State gubernatorial election.

2.The results so far confirm to us that our candidate has garnered approximately 55% of the total votes cast by voters. We have every reason to be confident that we will maintain this trend and coast home to victory.

3.However, we are aware that members of the All Progressives' Congress (APC) led by Governor Adams Oshiomole, in collusion with officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) led by Mrs. Amina Waziri, are relentless in their efforts to manipulate the results of this election. We are aware that Governor Oshiomole is currently moving from collation centre to collation centre with the objective of manipulating the results as much as possible.

4.We will like to reiterate our earlier notes of warning. The Edo people, and our party, will resist any attempt to subvert the collective will of the people as expressed by their votes today.

5.We urge our members and supporters in the state to continue keeping the faith by guarding their votes at the Ward Collation Centres and Local Government Collation Centres. Eternal vigilance is the price we all have to pay for victory.

6.God bless Edo State. God bless Nigeria.

It is obvious that this government is targeting select individuals who served in Jonathan's administration. We are all aware that this country was wrecked by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and those now in the All Progressives Congress, APC. We also know that 70% of the leaders in the APC were in the PDP before they jumped ship, and that they participated in bringing down this economy, destroying the name of the PDP in the process. If really you are fighting corruption, you must not look at only one of the two sets of politicians. As things stand presently, record shows that only those who served under the PDP administration of former President Jonathan are being targeted in the anti-corruption war. However, corruption has been going on in Nigeria ever since the military seized power in 1966. Government should go back to 1966. to effectively fight this war That is not too long ago. The records are there. The anti-corruption war should not target President Jonathan's administration alone!

Many people will disagree with you on your claim that the anti-corruption war is targeting only PDP people on the grounds that an associate of the President, Jafaru Isa, was arrested by the EFCC. Isa was, infact, said to have refunded some money and may be prosecuted?

That is only one person! We have a backlog of untouched corrupt people. Many of those serving in the current government have been accused of corruption. Every political party after the First Republic participated in corruption. In the First Republic, corruption was practically nil; this disturbingly level of corruption started from the inception of military rule in 1966. It is so bad that no government since then can be exempted and no former leader, except Tafawa Balewa, Yakubu Gowon and Murtala Muhammed, were alleged not to be involved in corruption.

Trump won sweeping victories across the South and in New England on Tuesday, a show of strength in the Republican primary campaign that underscored the breadth of his appeal and helped him begin to amass a wide delegate advantage despite growing resistance to his candidacy among party leaders. Mr. Trump's political coalition â€” with his lopsided victories in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts and Tennessee, and narrower ones in Arkansas, Vermont and Virginia â€” appears to have transcended the regional and ideological divisions that have shaped the Republican Party in recent years.

1690703604505977_1700981243478213,"Buhari Declares Total Support For Palestinian State.

President Muhammadu Buhari has declared his total support for a two-state solution to the Israel- Palestine conflict.

The Nigerian President stated this during a meeting on Sunday with the Emir of Qatar, Tamim Bin Hammad Al-Thani, his spokesperson, Femi Adesina, said.
""I want to assure you that we will stand side by side with you, until our brothers and sisters in Palestine achieve their desired objectives,"" he said.
""Our support for various Security Council resolutions restoring and respecting 1967 boundaries with Jerusalem as capital of Palestine is firm and unshaken.""

Mr. Buhari's stance on the Israeli-Palestine conflict is similar with that of most countries of the world including the European Union, and Qatar is believed to be one of the major backers of Palestine including backing Hamas which governs Gaza. 

However Israel and the United States have repeatedly blocked any United Nations resolution mandating a two-state solution. The non-resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and lack of progress in resolving it is considered the greatest foreign policy failure of President Barack Obama of the U.S.

At the meeting in Qatar, the Nigerian President also declared as ""totally unacceptable,"" the huge drop in the price of crude which has seen international oil prices plummet from over $100 a barrel last year to about $30.

President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday in Doha emphasised the need for member states of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, and non-OPEC members to cooperate and find a common ground to stabilise crude oil prices.

Speaking at a bilateral meeting with the Sheikh Tamim Bin Hammad Al-Thani, the Emir of the State of Qatar, President Buhari described the current market situation in the industry, which has seen oil prices plummet by 70 per cent since mid-2014, as ""totally unacceptable.""

""As members of OPEC and Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), our relations in the areas of oil and gas, which our two nations heavily rely on, need to be enhanced and coordinated for the benefit of our people.

""The current market situation in the oil industry is unsustainable and totally unacceptable.
""We must cooperate both within and outside our respective organisations to find a common ground to stabilize the market, which will be beneficial to our nations,'' the President said on the second day of his state visit to Qatar.

The President used the occasion of his address to the Emir to commend the existing cordial bilateral relations between both countries and invited prospective Qatari investors to take advantage of the abundant opportunities in Nigeria and invest in the key areas of energy, agriculture, real estate development, banking and finance.

He assured prospective investors of government protection of their persons and investment, noting that in the course of his visit, the delegations from Nigeria and Qatar would formalise at least two bilateral agreements to boost economic cooperation between both countries.
President Buhari also weighed-in on the situation in the Middle East, commending the role Qatar is playing in resolving the present Syrian crisis, the Palestinian cause and efforts in reconstructing Gaza.

""The conflicts in Yemen and Syria with their attendant humanitarian crisis need genuine international effort to solve. Nigeria as a peace loving country identifies with the State of Qatar in all her peace efforts in the world to end terrorist activities.

""Nigeria is a victim of terrorism. It is with heavy heart that I stand before you and say activities of Boko Haram have led to loss of many lives and displacement of innocent people in our dear nation.

""We, however, take pride to inform you that since our coming to power, Boko Haram has been systematically decimated and are in no position to cause serious threat to our development programs.

""I wish to reiterate that Nigeria rejects violence and extremism in all their ramifications, and assure your Highness that we are with the State of Qatar in your efforts to fight terrorism and injustice in your region and in the world at large.""
President Buhari also called for a lasting solution to the Israeli â€“ Palestinian conflict , saying ""we in Nigeria, like the State of Qatar, favour a 'Two State' solution, with the State of Palestine living side by side with the State of Israel.

""I want to assure you that we will stand side by side with you, until our brothers and sisters in Palestine achieve their desired objectives.

""Our support for various Security Council resolutions restoring and respecting 1967 boundaries with Jerusalem as capital of Palestine is firm and unshaken,'' he said.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheRepublicanNews/photos/a.1700981266811544.1073741828.1690703604505977/1700981243478213/?type=3,2016-02-28 13:45:18,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
