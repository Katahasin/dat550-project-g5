This reasoning plays into the hands of extremist Islamic groups today.

There has been no way for people to reject the past Empire and Caliphate in West Africa as failed systems because they were not replaced by better systems.

Whatever democratic values were handed to these newly independent states were short-lived, trampled by military incursions. Military leadership suppressed freedoms in every aspect.

We assess that Iran will continue in indirect channels with a parallel nuclear program, realized long before the 10-year target of the JCPOA.
