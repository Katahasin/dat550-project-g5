Almost all have drifted substantially toward the Left, and some have more than drifted—the Republican-appointed Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, and David Souter were pulled so far with the tide that they ended up on an entirely different beach.

Where the federation would have respected the rights and cultures of its members, the union demands state-enforced homogeneity.
