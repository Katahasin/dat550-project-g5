Join us every 3rd Thursday for free film-screenings and live panel discussion at the Real News Network Studios in downtown Baltimore.

Next Screening: The Homestretch

Produced and directed by Anne de Mare and Kirsten Kelly

""The Homestretch follows three homeless teens as they fight to stay in school, graduate, and build a future. Each of these smart, ambitious teenagers - Roque, Kasey and Anthony - will surprise, inspire, and challenge audiences to rethink stereotypes of homelessness as they work to complete their education while facing the trauma of being alone and abandoned at an early age.

Through haunting images, intimate scenes, and first-person narratives, these teens take us on their journeys of struggle and triumph. As their stories unfold, the film connects us deeply with larger issues of poverty, race, juvenile justice, immigration, foster care, and LGBTQ rights."" - Homestretch Film website

The recent Department of Justice report on the Baltimore City Police Department exposed the rampant abuse many in Baltimore know well, but many think it fell short of offering real solutions to end this abuse through accountability. 

What does real community control of the police look like? Why are officers so infrequently jailed, or even fired, for abuse? Can you reform the police department from within? How do you deal with police reform without dealing with chronic poverty, low wages, and the war on drugs?

Activists, elected officials and candidates, scholars, police officers and other Baltimore residents will discuss and debate how to affect real change. We'll look into what the DOJ and other government bodies can do, and what communities can do right now. We'll also examine the role of police in society, and what we want that role to be.

Let's come up with real solutions to make the police department accountable to the people of Baltimore, and respect people's constitutional rights.

Several months ago, investigative journalist Bruce Livesey produced a documentary about the Koch brothers for Global News. The film focused on the Koch's vast holdings in Alberta's controversial tar sands, their campaign to deny climate change, and their political influence. But days before the video was set to air, executives at Global News pulled it from their broadcast schedule and Bruce was fired.

Bruce has teamed up with The Real News Network to expose the Koch brothers' war on the environment and their plan to buy the 2016 elections. We have raised half the money needed to produce and distribute the documentary, we need your help to raise the remaining funds needed and finish making the film.

Please take a moment to LIKE and SHARE this post and visit our website for more information: http://therealnews.com/the-doubt-machine

If you watched last week's #Demdebate, you likely caught Bernie Sanders's statement about the Koch brothers' influence on politics. Despite this kind of national exposure, still too few people are aware of the Koch brothers and their current efforts to buy the White House. Together, we can change that. 

Several months ago, investigative journalist Bruce Livesey produced a documentary about the Koch brothers for Global News. The film focused on the Koch's vast holdings in Alberta's controversial tar sands, their campaign to deny climate change, and their political influence. But days before the video was set to air, executives at Global News pulled it from their broadcast schedule and Bruce was fired. 

Today, Bruce is teaming up with The Real News Network to expose the Koch brothers' war on the environment and their plan to buy the 2016 presidential election - and we need your help.

We need your help to get the word out. Please like and share this post and like The Real News Network for updates.

Why?

Because after Iowa, it's even more apparent that mainstream media has no interest in providing a critical context for citizens seeking to make a deeply informed decision about the presidential elections.

Monopoly media stands in defense of the status quo. Corporate-owned television networks - liberal and conservative - treat grave problems as mere background for sham political theatre. No wonder: they sell at least $11.4 billion a year in political advertising.

Be it war and the destruction of whole societies, catastrophic consequences of climate change, chronic poverty and the ravaging of workers' living standards, or systemic racism and mass incarceration - all of the candidates in the primaries should be judged on how they will address these issues.

With your support, we will observe the media-marginalized Sanders campaign and highlight the substantive differences between Sanders and Clinton, a distinction the major news networks have failed to make. We will dig into the ideas of Trump, Cruz, and Rubio and examine how such policies will affect the lives of working people. Live from the Media Center and on the street, live from a Sanders rally to challenging interviews with Trump supporters, we will give you a view of the process you won't see anywhere else.",,status,,2016-02-05 17:47:54,2218,100,888,2218,0,0,0,0,0

- Major Neill Franklin a former chief trainer of the Baltimore police department will be allowed as an expert witness for the prosecution.

16512617979_470052996507148,"RESISTENCIA: A Special Screening of a Thrilling Documentary on the Resistance to a Honduran Coup

EVENT DETAILS:

""When a 21st century coup d'état ousts the only president they ever believed in, these farmers take over the plantations. With no plans to ever give them back.""

After being shown at festivals worldwide, this groundbreaking documentary on the resistance to the 2009 Honduran coup d'état is coming to Baltimore. Filmmaker Jesse Freeston will be with us to lead a post-film discussion.

TRAILER: resistenciathefilm.com/trailer

""Freeston's extensive footage from post-coup Aguan transmits the collective excitement that comes with reclaiming the right to a dignified existence."" - Belén Fernández, Warscapes

For more reviews see: resistenciathefilm.com/reviews

THE FILM: 

June 28th 2009, the first coup d'état in a generation in Central America overthrows the elected president of Honduras. A nationwide resistance movement is born, which takes inspiration from the daring act of the farmers of the Aguan Valley to take over 10,000 acres of palm oil plantations claimed by the country's largest landowner, and a key player in the coup. Filmed over four years beginning with the coup itself, 'Resistencia: The Fight for the Aguan Valley' follows three key members of the farmers' resistance as they convert the plantations into a workers co-op and agitate for a more democratic state, all while trying to survive the violent reaction of the landlord and the coup regime.

What's more difficult, and often lost, is listening to people like Bobbi Smallwood, whose son was famously given a $500,000 bail for smashing in a police car window during the Baltimore uprisings, talk about the pain of being caught up in that system.

Last week, her son's trial was set to begin but instead, not only was the trial postponed but Smallwood's husband, Maurice, was arrested after muttering that the case was bullshit. 

We found Smallwood crouched and crying in one of the hallways in the court house building while her husband sat across from her in handcuffs. It turns out they couldn't arrest him for what he said under his breath, so they arrested him instead for wearing a hat in the court room.

""I go for open-heart surgery Monday,"" Smallwood said in a broken voice, and ""because my son and my husband"" are locked up, ""I can't go. I got so much stress on me.""

""This system is gone,"" she said. ""This world is going to an end. It's so bad that before I go to bed at night, I pray to God that I don't even wake up the next morning 'cause I can't take it. I'm tired. I'm literally dying.""

Background: On January 12, 1960, George Jackson was sentenced to one year to life for a $70 gas station robbery. He would serve eleven years and seven months, with seven of those years in solitary confinement. On August 21, 1971, he was assassinated.

In the intervening years, Jackson penned two centerpieces of revolutionary canonical texts: Soledad Brother and Blood In My Eye. In this screening, you will see and hear Jackson's ideas spoken, performed, and reflected by artists, activists, comrades, loved ones and the people to whom he spoke who now speak him back to us.",I Mix What I Like Screening - Releasing the Dragon: A Tribute to George Jackson and Black August,event,https://www.facebook.com/events/1047544245256462/,2015-08-06 12:32:34,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
