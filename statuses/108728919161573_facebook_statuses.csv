108728919161573_1479997312034720,"""Milo and Tomi, both shock jocks who have risen to fame with bitter, shallow rants that strike at the heart of an angry electorate. They have been successful in nailing some of our more emotional responses to certain issues and thus we allowed them to take over certain media platforms without understanding who they are and what they really stand for on pertinent issues like….oh, pedophilia and pederasty.

We mocked Obama for eight years for being a teleprompter president—and then these same people lauded a pretty young girl who brags she doesn't read books, has been out of high school less time than I've owned my favorite pair of shoes, and can read an angry rant off of a… teleprompter, no less. And thus handing the heady responsibility of a conservative spokesperson over to a woman-child who …like, totally, is just speaking ""her truth""… not THE truth, her truth. And that…like, totally, changes depending on the audience and what her applause meter is reading at the moment. She's a fame climber. An opportunist who has used you, the conservative listeners who invested in her day after day as she constantly updated us on how many views her latest clip got, to climb for bigger and better mainstream audiences that do not include the cornerstones of constitutional conservative values.

We have lost the ability to have a reasonable discussion and respectful debate and have lowered our standards out of anger. Hissy fits do not change hearts and influence minds.

Stop turning these shock jocks into political celebrities. Stop putting them on pedestals and turning into fawning fan girls over their latest harangue. Demand more out of those who claim to speak on behalf of conservatism.

Let's have a return to thoughtful and intelligent conservatism. One that we can be proud of and doesn't consist entirely of bombastic tirades and blustering diatribes. Constitutional conservatism deserves a responsible deliberation – one that compels and inspires dialogue and long-term change that doesn't snap back in angry response in four years. One that emboldens the thinkers instead of the reactors. One that offers a thoughtful alternative instead of a muttering ""snowflake!"" response. Believe it or not, many on the other side of the aisle are good people with a different viewpoint. And many times they've never even been exposed to what conservatives believe on a policy by policy viewpoint.

We've destroyed opportunities to effect conservative change in so many circles, not because we don't have a valuable message that will resonate if delivered properly, but because we've given the mouthpieces over to some of the loudest and least thoughtful among us. Take them back. How about a little less Howard Stern and a lot more William Buckley?

Every man in our party who even tepidly endorsed his candidacy and promised to support him was shown an opened back door with which to save their dignity by this egregious revelation and almost all of them stayed; proving they have no real values, no real principles, no real decency—but even in their weak and neutered state, still think they have some chance of winning?

These men had a defining moment and instead became gutless wonders who issued simpering statements—going up to the line and then refusing to cross it.

They have decimated this party of so many strong conservative female voices who will refuse to ever lend their support again. I, for one, am done. I can never fight for a party who finds this level of degeneracy acceptable. There are no redeeming qualities left for me to ever defend. I can never, in good conscience, shield the kind of men who protects a deviant of this sort, all for the sake of some meaningless win.

What do we have left to stand for? What moral fortitude can you ever claim moving forward? Our party has nothing left if we accept this as status quo. This is the kind of moral relativism that makes an epic mockery of your previous values. You've literally sold your souls to ""stand by your scum,"" making you no different than those whom you oppose.

This ship needs to sink and burn and every spineless man in the party who went along with this, even halfheartedly, needs to go down with it. And, I can assure you, I am simply one of legions who will remember the names.""",Conservative Women Abandon The Gutless Wonders Of Republican Party,link,http://www.libertyjuice.com/2016/10/18/conservative-women-abandon-the-gutless-wonders-of-republican-party/,2016-10-18 11:24:36,69,42,16,53,6,0,5,3,2

108728919161573_1299993343368452,"Beth Moore wasn't alone in her condemnation of Trump. Her comments sent ripples around the evangelical world and were seconded by Christian mega-speaker and author Christine Caine. Sara Groves, the Dove Award-nominated Christian artist, told me, ""Someone like Beth can go a long way in helping Evangelicals recognize these major blind spots.""

Groves herself was impacted by Trump's remarks. ""When I first heard the tape, I was shocked, and a bit surprised at how deeply it hit me,"" she said. ""I immediately thought of my own experiences, and of friends who have experienced much worse.""

Dr. Russell Moore—head of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission and a leading conservative Christian voice against Trump—says he is hearing privately from women like Groves and Moore all the time.

""I have heard from many, many evangelical women who are horrified by Christian leaders ignoring this as an issue,"" Moore told me. He says these women leaders have ""spent their entire life teaching girls to find their identity in Christ and not in an American culture that sexualizes and objectifies them""—and they are now disgusted that evangelical men are not standing up and speaking out. Nish Weiseth, popular Christian blogger and author said that when it comes to Christian men still supporting Trump, ""Disappointed seems like too soft a word.

108728919161573_1299615836739536,"I know this post will generate a lot of mail that I don't necessarily feel like dealing with. But there are those moments that are so compelling to one's heart that they must handle it. So here is my raw moment of honesty…

Right now my heart is struggling with everything I've ever believed. My struggle is with the church. I'm watching the reaction to how leaders in The Church, many whom I've known my entire life, are destroying their testimonies by not only accepting this reprobate- but are blasphemously using God's Word to defend him!

I was floored and appalled when I read a comment on my page by a missionary this morning who our family has financially supported to ""stop bitching"" about Trump. I was emailed by a ""Christian woman"" yesterday who told me that I should ""feel flattered if a man talked to me that way."" I get refusals from Christian fathers to respond when I ask if they were willing to sacrifice the ""crotches of their daughters"" to save the country from Hillary. They respond with venomous attacks because their answer will either make them look like a hypocrite or a reprobate. Another woman who was the wife of a former pastor told me in regards to the same question, ""As far as my daughters and grand-daughters are concerned, I trust them to God's care."" Maybe the victim's fathers simply didn't trust them into God's care quite enough and Trump really isn't responsible for any of it?

I sat in church yesterday morning and I just felt grieved. It was hard for me to participate. In fact, I left early. The amount of ""church people"" who are dismissing this entire debacle as acceptable and normal, and attacking the voices who are saying, ""no, this isn't who we are!!!"" makes me question everything. Do I even want to leave my little girl in the nursery with groups of people who feel it's morally acceptable to defend this all for the sake of their party? The amount of church leaders who work in the youth groups who aren't fighting this on a spiritual front and remaining silent leaves me wondering why bother? Where are the courageous men who are standing up and leading our boys towards Christ and demanding that they not become a part of the group who gives it up to go along? These are the men and women I entrust influencing the spiritual lives of my family… where is the righteous outrage? Where is the accountability as a body towards one another?...

I know we don't look to man. Man will fail us. But man makes up the fellowship and part of it is becoming rotten.

Men and women who I trust to pour God's Word into the heart of my children or care and nurture them in the nurseries of the churches, instead pours fuel on the cultural wars they declare to fight by declaring their unwavering support for a deviant because of…. politics? All the while declaring with a Bible in one hand and a shaking fist, that ""we must trust God!"" Apparently, we can only trust Him so far— we have to throw our testimonies under the bus to avoid Hillary Clinton – because He definitely can't be trusted with that one.

Speaker Ryan, we don't care that you are ""sickened"" by his comments and dis-invited him to your party. It's not enough. Franklin Graham, any statement ending with a ""but Hillary"" is shameful and a mockery of our faith. Scott Walker, yes, ""it's inexcusable""- but so is your lack of fortitude to offer America more than that.

Disown him. Call for an emergency meeting, demand his resignation, and replace him with Pence. If he refuses, call for the party leadership to resign as protest. Cut off funding for his campaign.

The only hope for the future of this weak and neutered party is to dump trump and call on voters to vote down ballot to be a stop gap for Hillary. Own this debacle. Offer a massive apology to the country for not violently repudiating him when you had the chance. What else will it take?

Your statements aren't enough. Disavow. Unendorse. Beg the country for forgiveness. It is pivotal that we have a moral ground to stand on in this country and in the international community.

To my fellow conservative commentators. No, these aren't just ""mean and vulgar"" comments as many of you are trying to portray. This is a man describing how he preys on women, even as unwilling participants, and you are spinning yourselves into a political grave as you attempt to justify despicable behavior.

Now is your defining moment. Your reaction will be what goes down in your personal history book. Will you save your integrity or will you maintain your position? You have wives, mothers, sisters, daughters. Imagine them being in the cross-hairs of a sick and entitled depraved lecher. They deserve better than your weak attempts at salvaging the unsalvageable. He's not worth it. The sting of Trump will eventually fade. Your personal character and virtue will not.

If this is how Trump feels entitled as a celebrity, can you imagine how he'd feel entitled as a president?""

108728919161573_1288171171217336,"""The bar has been set so low for Trump regarding basic knowledge that he practically walks in with a handicap sticker on his chest. He gets away with non-answers using bluster and aggression. No other candidate on either side of the aisle would have ever gotten away with the 90 minutes of inane jabbering that answered few of the very pointed questions posed to him.

Trump continues to prove that nothing he says, does, or doesn't understand matters to his base. They are devoted and will not be swayed by mere incompetence.

The first presidential debate solidified what we all suspected. He has a few talking points, but barely enough to handle a decent dinner table chat. He is a reactionary man who spent crucial time demanding people understand his offences toward humanity instead of using it to fillet Hillary on the easy knockouts.

Where were the punches on Benghazi, the emails, the Deplorables? His goody bag was overflowing with ammo and he blew it all because he doesn't have the self-control to focus or the discernment to use those when he's given an opening.

Trump and his team know they lost this round. When your campaign comes out and calls it ""a draw,"" and you spend the next day complaining about the volume of your mic, you know the game didn't end well.

And yet, the distrust in Hillary Clinton, the most damaged and unaccomplished candidate Democrats could offer, leaves voters at war between their fear of his instability and ineptness and their misgivings of her corruption and character.

My prediction for the second debate is that Trump will come out harder. By now his campaign is feeling foolish that they failed to hit homeruns on easy lobs. Both teams have gotten their feet wet and will come in for missed opportunities.

And who knows? Trump might actually prepare for this next round...""

108728919161573_1280312862003167,"""Reince protected a passing fad instead of the torch of conservatism.  He protected a man instead of the party.  He caved to pressure when we needed a leader to stand up and declare that we have nothing in common as a party with the words that comes from the mouth of Donald J. Trump.  He led the party from its conservative platform to Democrat-lite.  A party that once stood for smaller government, individual liberty, and personal freedom now unabashedly embraces big government subsidies, mandated policies, its own form of Obamacare, and cherry picks its new welfare policies for all.

Now, once again, instead of using his influence and voice as RNC Chairman to unite and heal a fractured GOP during a very contentious election cycle, he's suddenly discovered a temporary backbone and is using it to vilify and threaten those candidates and office holders who refuse to play this dangerous game he has forced them into, saying, ""Those people need to get on board. And if they're thinking they're going to run again someday, I think that we're going to evaluate the process – of the nomination process and I don't think it's going to be that easy for them"".

We are in the middle of a party upheaval that is bound to leave the Republican party dissolved into the same historical ash heap as the Whigs.  Whether Trump wins or loses, there will be a day of reckoning for the Republican Party.  It has shunned common sense conservatives and partnered with the most degenerate factions of our society in the false belief that the end justifies the means.

The pain train is comin'.  Reince Preibus knows it and like every weak leader, he's looking for skirts to hide behind.""

""For the first time in my adult life I have no dog in this political fight.  It's a bewildering feeling having two maniacal and wicked candidates so similar in nature and policy and equally detrimental to the future of this nation's democracy that I can't find a lesser of evil.  No, this #NeverTrumper recognizes that there are two terrible choices here…. One is representative of evil and corruption and the other is representative of insanity and corruption.  Candidates who receive pay-offs are as corrupt as those who give them.

And Republicans who continue to massage their dying consciences by telling themselves ""he's better"" are lying to all of us.  There is no ""win"" here for America and there will be no joy on election night no matter who wins this presidency.

I reject the cries for unity.  Those who beg for unity do so to assuage their guilt.  I've been told by some of those leading this war cry that ""they've set aside their moral compass in order to keep Hillary out of the White House.""  Literal words that have tumbled from their mouths.  In doing so, they become no different from those they seek to stop.  Men and women driven by ""winning"" and not by conviction.  Misery loves company and I won't be a provider to that.

We have two candidates unfit for office.  And Trump supporting Republicans who can't make one comprehensive argument on how Trump is any different than Hillary, constantly like to point to the tragedy in Benghazi as their ""Trump card.""

I say, give Trump a little bit of power and a little bit of time and he can make Benghazi look like child's play.  This is a man who has no understanding of the geo-political situations in our world, nor any discernment, wisdom, pragmatism, or loyalty- other than to himself.  He enables our enemies, he denounces our allies, and when faced with a similar decision, there is no reason to believe he would have done anything different than Hillary Clinton.

No, I'm not rooting for a Hillary win- anymore than I would be rooting for a Trump win.  No, this is a lose-lose situation for democracy, contrary to the ridiculous notion that #NeverTrumpers will be celebrating a Trump loss on election night.  I won't be attending an election party with streamers, balloons, and tasty drinks.  No, I'll be on my couch at home – most likely in a darkened house and with a sad and somber spirit.  This is going to be a dark four years no matter what the outcome is for America.  There is no ""win"" here for us.  It's going to be brutal and I want everyone to understand, without a shadow of a doubt, that there will be no joy for us on election night if Hillary wins.

While I believe the route of national suicide will be slower under Hillary, instead of the quick slash of death committed by a Trump presidency, ultimately we will watch the further disintegration of everything that has made America the shining city upon the hill.  There will be a deep veil over our country.

But simply because one of these regimes are inevitable, doesn't mean I have to participate in one conquering the other.   It's been asked before and is worth repeating… What does it gain a man to win the presidency and yet lose his soul?""

""I'm tired of meaningless wins...

...Our nation is in a state of mourning and hurt, full of festering anger and deep wounds. We are leaderless.

The Democrats offer nothing but more victimhood status, class envy, and race baiting. We have a unique opportunity — like none other in our lifetime — to step forward and nominate a candidate who can unify a nation starving for a real chief.

We need a leader who doesn't identify its citizens by race, by colour, or by class; and one who celebrates the differences and doesn't use them as tools of division to further advance their personal or party power.

This is the last stand for us to find that leader.

I long for the days of ""Give me liberty or give me death"" — not ""Give me liberty ... or a prime-time speaking slot at the convention, a VP position, a new gig at CNN, or a powerful cabinet seat.""

Cleveland will no doubt birth a few of these men and women. But will there be enough of these delegates willing to draw their own line in the sand to make a difference that will have an impact on history? Will there be enough who will stand up and declare that building a castle on sinking sand isn't a ""win"" — it's simply a mirage.

Delegates, the responsibility for the direction of this union should lie heavily on your conscience.

And it is moments like this where history is made. Will you nominate a man who will throw fuel on flames of hate while rebranding and redefining what we stand for as a party?

Or will you demand to vote your conscience and offer the voters of this country a real alternative to the weakest, most damaged Democratic candidate we've ever been faced with?

The world is watching.""

108728919161573_1199557433412044,"Is a Clinton by another name any less repugnant??

""I was a young girl when Bill Clinton was elected President. We were fresh off years of Republican reign and I was in a home that found our loss infuriatingly unacceptable. I was raised on a steady diet of Tex-Mex and Rush Limbaugh. I rarely know any of the popular songs from the 90's because we didn't listen to music in the car- instead, I was steadily inundated with the Limbaugh Institute of Conservative Studies.

The Clinton years toiled by alongside my teenage years and it didn't take long for Clinton's name to become synonymous with any foul four letter word in our home. We devolved into a nation high off Reagan inspiration to one preaching government dependency. And with that was ushered a new shameful chapter flaunting sexual deviancy and adultery.

I remember my dad flipping off the tv when us kids would walk into the room because the national news was sordidly full of nothing but cigars, semen, and a young girl not much older than me who sported a blue dress. There was a blanket of shame covering America.

As I grew into an older teen, most girls my age were stuck on Danielle Steele books while I was the political nerd devouring Reagan's autobiography and Clinton exposes. Thus for many years, I have had a deep and personal understanding of exactly who the Clinton's are, knowing their insatiable thirst and willingness to do anything for more power.

As we began to move closer to the launch of the 2016 presidential campaign and my fellow Republicans began to bemoan a Hillary candidacy, I was sharpening my knowledge and preparing my tools. I wasn't just prepared to take on the Hillary Clinton machine – I was looking forward to it. In a day and age where Democrats have made their main taking point a faux ""war on women"" in an effort to create more victims with which to ""rescue,"" I was excited to turn it back around and shine the spotlight on the one woman who had enabled one of the greatest offenders of women of all time. Bill Clinton.

I passionately detested her, I was repulsed by her husband, and I could articulate why...""

108728919161573_1191675100866944,"My latest is my message to Speaker Paul Ryan and other party leaders!=>

""A beast of this nature can only be ignored for so long until it grows into a raging infection that also leaves those affiliated with Trump at risk. Endorsements and support leave those handing them over to Trump wreaking of the stench that comes from dying principles.

And as was inevitable, we have reached a day of reckoning. Decision time. Principles are being weighed against political careers and the results will create leaders or lechers.The days of shirking the responsibilities that are a part of the mantle of conservatism that one declares precious to one's soul are over. The clock of cowardice is running out and it's time to stand up and be counted.

It's easy to take a stand when one is surrounded by an audience who largely agrees with you. It's easy when you are standing against the Democrats. But, that's not courage. Real courage is taking a stand when you know you may be standing alone...

I have a message for Speaker Paul Ryan: ""I understand you've no doubt been under great political pressure. And yet, I can see how torn you are to be associated with a man like Trump, who shares none of your values and is an embarrassment to your party. You are not responsible for the choices of those who voted for Trump and you are not obligated to share in the same devastating decision process. You are not just leader of the Republican Party as Speaker of the House. You are the leader of both parties, the People's House. Your loyalty belongs to your country.

If I were you, I'd offer to relinquish my title and go down in history as a rare breed of leadership who puts their soul over powerful party position.

Courage is contagious. Inspire other leaders in the party to regain their dignity and reclaim their convictions.""

This election is like none other. It will go down in the history books as a race for two destructive, ego-driven, and dangerous candidates. For those of us who left our blood, sweat, and tears on the battlefield during the primary to stop Trump and deliver a candidate worthy of taking down a Hillary presidency—the race is over and we won't be contributing to either of these great debacles.

The question for each of you remains…. Which side of history do you want to be on?""

Democrats, what if I told you that you could start your own #NeverHillary referendum? What if I told you that you could also put principle over party? What if I told you that you didn't have to fall in line with this ridiculous game of playing which party could elect the worst POTUS?

The ironic thing about this entire election season is that the negative campaign ads are tragically ambidextrous. Take out the names of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and most negative ads could apply to either of them. One is guilty of aiding and abetting a man who preys on women and the other has his own laundry list of sexual assault accusations. Both are willing to do or say anything for more power and lie their way to the top. Each are thugs in their own right who have built their successes on a pile of scandals. Both operate with no moral compass, integrity, or basic sense of human decency.

We, as a nation, somehow managed to find the two most debauched and depraved human beings on the planet as each of our party's nominees. Join me in making the decision to refuse to cooperate with either one of them.

One of these degenerates will win this election. But I say, let it be done by an embarrassingly low number. No mandate. Without the will of the people breathing wind into their sails.

Consider regaining the dignity of your own party and matching our #NeverTrump with a #NeverHillary. If the sheep are to be led to a slaughter, let it be done without all of our cooperation.""

108728919161573_1176798262354628,"My thoughts on the RIDICULOUS ""unity"" nonsense for The Toronto Sun..

""...Not that Trump has suddenly ceased to be a vile, profane, liberal animal, but many naively believe that they must rally behind him for the sake of ""unity"" and, more importantly, a ""win.""

To respond with a ""win what, exactly?"" only produces sputtering nonsensical and ridiculous responses that involve Hillary Clinton's name interjected multiple times.

Enter the sick delusions.

New talking points have been disseminated and they come along with instructions to combine them with as many wild-eyed convincing gestures possible. They include: ""Trump doesn't mean what he has been saying. He doesn't really know what he believes, but he will surround himself with conservatives who will force him to govern conservatively.""

Self-deception is real.

History is the best indicator of future behaviour. Trump is 70 years old with a very long and sordid history.

The only positive in all of it is that he has been consistent — consistently terrible when it comes to morals and character. He has always surrounded himself with ""yes-men,"" purposefully avoiding those who would dare keep him accountable.

""The Supreme Court of the United States is at stake and we can't have Hillary appointees!"" As if one sincerely believes that Trump would nominate any justice who would restrain him and hold him to the constitution — a binding contract with which he holds no knowledge, regard or respect.

Perhaps you've heard, ""At least Trump's pro-life!"" Well, no, I don't believe he is. It's a stretch to believe a man who supported partial birth abortion five minutes ago, announced his belief that planned parenthood does great things for women, and now wants to modify the pro-life plank of the Republican Party is a genuine champion for life.

The most popular tagline among Evangelicals looking to justify their vote is: ""We aren't electing a pastor. We are electing a president."" Of course, we aren't electing a pastor. And as a Christian conservative, I'm not looking for a Christian candidate. But I am looking for a moral one.

Three months ago, people scoffed at these insane (and yes, they are insane) talking points by Trump supporters. Now they find themselves in the unenviable position of parroting them. For what, I ask? To ""win"" what exactly, do tell?

Every fiery, political sermon against Hillary could easily be used against the policy and character of our own nominee.

Return to your senses. Regain your dignity. Pull yourself together and remember what you stand for. And in the words of a great former first lady: ""Just Say No.""

It's been a poignant and devastating reminder of what our Founding Fathers sacrificed in order to build this shining city upon a hill.  They surrendered lives of comfort, abandoned successful careers and fortunes, left the contentment of their homes and their loved ones, and resigned themselves to death…all for the sake of liberty.

And then I reflect on how this election has been a pruning.  The smaller branches went first.  Many of the previous ""Tea Party"" leaders who used that platform to build names for themselves, some with well-lined pockets, and book deals that came with their Tea Party pulpits were some of the first to whore out their principles.

No, these men and women were the paradoxical versions of our Founding Fathers.  They traded their principles for fame, fortune, and celebrity.  Some did it for a large paycheck, others did it for seats at the White House Correspondence Dinners, 'surrogate' positions, dozens of weekly hits on national television, and spots in Glamour magazine.

These people…these men and women?…  No, they will go down in history NOT as lovers of liberty…but as lovers of self.

And then we had the high hanging limbs.  Those who resisted strongly to fall in line with populism during the primary.  They were the ones who said, ""We've got your back.  We will never support this fraud.  He is a 'cancer' to our party.""  And within seconds of the primary ending, began envisioning their possible new home in the Vice President's mansion.  Men who were former Governors, sitting Senators, and now struggling to stay relevant saw themselves in important and comfortable Cabinet positons.

And one by one, they caved. Chris Christie. Rick Perry.  Rand Paul.  Bobby Jindal.

They had spent months mocking and deriding Trump supporters as being conned and easily manipulated voters without conservative thought or principle and now they have joined their ranks, becoming one of the pandered to.   Proving to American voters, exactly WHY we don't trust them.

Sellouts.  Leaving us wondering… Where have all the good men gone?

Well, the good men are still here.  The tree is now solid.  The branches are cleaned of dead debris and fruitless wood.  The branches left are strong and tested.

I'm in proud company.  Ranks of men and women who have been put through hell and are standing strong.  These are the people who didn't cave to peer pressure, who couldn't be bought off with promises of deals and popularity. They are who you want standing with you when the going gets tough, blood has been drawn, and the wounds run deep.

Why?  Because one day this will be behind us.  The Republican party may disintegrate.  The former planks once worth fighting for (even though imperfectly represented at times) will have been redrawn and re-branded into something shameful and unrecognizable.

But the Conservative movement will rise again.  And there will be a new generation of conservative leadership emerging.  One that is credit-worthy, proven, and dependable.""

But Trump violates basic human decency on a regular basis and is ideologically opposed to and unable to reconcile himself with any of our conservative policies.

My principles define my party — my party does not define my principles and when my party nominates a man who makes a mockery of everything that I believe in, I refuse to support him simply for the sake of group think.

This was supposed to be an election with an easy Republican win.
 We were up against a depraved woman on the verge of criminal indictment, detested by a majority of America. Instead, we scrounged up the one elitist progressive gutter bug more debauched than Clinton. A man who isn't a Republican, even by the loosest standards.

These are two vile human beings, morally bankrupt and rotten in spirit, who are willing to say or do anything for more of the power and authority that they crave. They are the yin to each other's yang and both are unfit to be president of this great nation.

Nevertheless, DC Democrats are thrilled. Because no matter the winner, they get a Democrat in the White House.

I am in very good company when I look around at the principled conservatives who refuse to be pandered to by the guy who slapped an R by his name and conned enough people into making him the Republican nominee. With the choice of two destructive animals, we say let it be done without our support, and by someone that we can fight.

Conservatism, if it is to be destroyed along with the country, will not be ravaged under our own banner. If it is to be ""redefined and rebranded"" under a flag of populism, xenophobia, fascism, demagoguery, and racist sympathies — let it be done without our participation.

If Hillary wins this election, it won't be because of those of us who refuse to vote for Trump, it will be because Trump supporters nominated a man who has sported the lowest favourability rating since 1984. This is your monster. You get to own it.""

Politics is a contact sport and right now we need someone willing to get a little bloody.

Carly isn't just a Pit-bull, she's articulate and incredibly well-versed on policy issues and that is even more glaringly obvious when put next to the bloviating frat boy, his anemic policy knowledge and stumbling and empty rhetoric.

While I'd love for us to be the party who puts the first woman in the Presidency or Vice Presidency position– not Hillary-esq style, simply because it's ""her turn"" and she feels entitled to the position- I don't buy into identity politics. I don't care if you are red, yellow, black or white, male or female, I simply want someone on the national stage who can articulate my values and attack those who are poised to hijack my party and redefine it under their own brand and banner of fascism.

Nevertheless, returning Carly to the national stage is going to prove painfully onerous for Trump simply because she IS a woman. And I think it's a brilliant move by the Cruz campaign.

In recent weeks, Trump has done his best to keep his deep-rooted and well documented misogyny tucked in and has avoided having to deal with females who publicly disagree with him.

But women haven't forgotten what he said about Carly in his Rolling Stone Magazine interview a few months ago, ""Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?""

Nobody gets under Trump's skin more than a strong, independent woman who can't be controlled or bought off. Women in his life have historically only had a few roles. They've either submitted and flourished financially within his business or family life, or they've been sexual exploits and only good for domination as he's often bragged in his books and interviews, or they've refused both of those roles and been the target of his public hateful musings and vulgar and demeaning comments.

Now, moving forward, Trump gets to react daily to a strong woman unafraid and unintimidated by his brand or wealth. And I imagine it will send him into a vortex of in-suppressible rage that will be impossible to control by his campaign.

And women will be watching as they head towards the voting booths to determine where the last remaining and coveted delegates will go.""

It's the method he's used to denounce Cher, Bette Midler, Angelina Jolie, and Rosie O'Donnell—""fat ass,"" ""slob, ""extremely unattractive,"" etc.—when they had the temerity to criticize him. The joy he takes in humiliating women is not something he even bothers to disguise. He told the journalist Timothy L.

""Conservatism took a beating Tuesday night, and once again, it was New York's own Donald Trump holding the club.  His resounding win in his home state's Republican primary was a bruising we'd been expecting. We braced ourselves for it. Of course Trump would win New York. He IS New York.

Nevertheless, this win adds to the fairy tale he and his team have worked hard to create. A tale of victimhood and unfairness, and weeping and gnashing of teeth over ""stolen delegates,"" which began in Colorado.

The narrative that Trump minions are spreading in the conservative media — that the ""will of the people is being usurped"" — is a blatant lie and an attempt to appeal to the uncontrollable emotions of the voter sporting the red trucker hat.

But here are the facts.

Activism isn't listening to talk radio and being a social media warrior. It isn't showing up every 4-8 years to pull a lever. Activism is getting involved on the grassroots level. It's working the phone banks, volunteering at your local headquarters, being a poll watcher, and registering people to vote.

Conservative media has complained for years that low-information voters gave us President Barack Obama. They've complained that the ""establishment"" forced its weakest candidate upon us as our nominee. And while part of that may hold truth, many in this media circle are now writhing in fake agony because states like Colorado changed the rules last year and put the responsibility to pick their nominee into the hands of the grassroots activists who actually put the time and effort into local politics — and out of the hands of the uninformed electorate who don't even care enough to vote consistently.

That's the right of any state. This was done before Trump was the frontrunner and the purpose was to protect the state's interests.

Every registered Republican voter was invited to participate in their local caucus and have a hand in electing delegates to represent them on a national level. In Colorado, 65,000 people did exactly that, and after plenty of debate, they elected and formed their delegation.

Ask each of these conservative ""leaders"" spreading this victimhood fairy tale how many times they've been to their local precinct convention. Or how many times they've been a delegate or had a hand in choosing delegates. With very few exceptions, you'll find most respond with blank stares and a ton of excuses.

I'm a mother of three with an incredibly busy schedule. Yet, I have rarely missed a precinct, senatorial, or state convention because I believe it's hypocritical to preach conservatism if I'm not willing to get involved when it matters.

The fact is, Trump was outworked in the states he's lost. Despite his rhetorical promises to put together ""the best teams,"" he failed to even collect a mildly competent one to help him navigate through individual states and their processes.

If you don't like the decisions being made in your state, then put your time where your mouth is and get involved where it actually matters. It's time to put up or shut up.""

108728919161573_1154194967948291,"I had to write it.

""We will go down in history as breeding a generation of idiots. We already know that our public schools are largely a failure to our children. History, when it's actually taught, has often been rewritten and has resulted in a whopping 38% of Americans who are unable to pass a simple citizen test.

Here are a few signs that you may be the uninformed electorate that our Founders warned us about:

1. ) You have lost the ability to think for yourself.

I can't tell you how often I've recently noticed that a growing number of people are unable to defend their positions without hiding behind a multitude of links and articles. They no longer use their God-given brain cells to debate– but boy, do they know how to use that copy and paste button.

When that fails, these same people will fall back on useless endorsements exclaiming that if ""Sarah Palin, Ben Carson, and Chris Christie says Trump's a good thing, than it must be true!"" Easily influenced and manipulated. Endorsements are often secured with a promise of power or position- not out of principle. And they are valuable in that they snag that slow witted group who lost the ability of self-thought.

2.) You believe the way a statement is spoken is more important than what is stated (aka he tells it like it is!) Except that no– no, he doesn't.

You believe that name calling and speaking really, really loudly with small punctuated words is the same thing as leadership and problem solving. You've replaced the art of logic with the emotions of anger.

We live in a world of reality tv and crassness that has overtaken our desire for a statesman. Class and thoughtful pragmatism has fallen by the wayside and has been exchanged for a desire for more profanity and vulgarity. ""It doesn't matter if it makes no sense, it is being said with the volatile anger that I feel!""

3.) Your knowledge of policy is limited to how high a wall may be, and that we need to ""fix those lines around the states.""

Who needs actual policy when you can throw around bloviating rhetoric that sounds so good and temporarily soothes the outrage? You are the guy in the Trump crowd who snaps to attention right before you dose off because you heard your trigger word: Wall. Just like a good puppet does, you dance to the tune that your master created just for you.

Forget the fact that when you actually sit down and read the Trump immigration plan, outside of being very ""Utopian"" and vague, it does reveal that he is a supporter of touchback amnesty and a Gestapo-like enforcement on private citizens that will usher in a police state and massive amounts of big government bureaucracy.

4.) You flood social media with false sensational headlines designed to provoke fear and hysteria.

There are a ton of narratives out there designed to take advantage of gullible readers. And Printly, Breitbart, Gateway Pundit, and Drudge giggle everytime their analytics go up and their ad checks are deposited.

5.) You suffer from the political version of Abused Wife Syndrome.

Every day you find yourself busy on social media defending Trump's atrocious behavior. You spend hours on social media spinning his quotes into something that might be more palatable.

He insults you by stating that you are too stupid for independent thought in so much that he could shoot people in the streets and you would still be devoted to him. And you know what, he's probably right.

It's a cult like devotion unlike anything I've ever seen in American history...""

Ted Cruz's decisive 20-point win in Wisconsin Tuesday was another solid step towards denying Donald Trump an outright victory and forcing this to a contested convention.

The Texas senator's strength is his ability to close the gap in the final days before a vote and seal the deal. The ground game was critical in Wisconsin and the Cruz campaign used its resources wisely.

Combined with the efforts of House Speaker Paul Ryan, Gov. Scott Walker, and a very influential and brave Wisconsin talk radio, Cruz picked up the momentum to pull off this vital conquest.

On the other hand, Trump's surrogates didn't make a dent. Sarah Palin fell flat, indicating that hopefully her star has finally fizzled. Unfortunately, it didn't happen before she profited from the conservative movement and then stabbed it in the back.

In a desperate move to try to regain the support of women, Trump dragged his third wife, Melania, onto the campaign stump with Fox News' Sean Hannity, who did his best as an unofficial Trump spokesman to paint them both in a positive light the night before the primary.

Melania's brief moments of speech in the hour-long interview were uncomfortable and awkward as she repeated her strange talking points that her husband ""would be great for the America ... and would not harm the women ... or the men.""

She certainly wasn't sufficiently convincing to make a lick of difference with Trump's unfavourable standing with women.

Trump, women care far more about your history with women than we do the pretty piece of jewelry that walks around on your arm and is occasionally allowed to speak.

What you say matters, what you sit up all night tweeting to Fox News' Megyn Kelly is relevant. Your consistent response with bullish tactics and demeaning and misogynistic rants says far more than what Melania is allowed to squeak out in an occasional interview.

Trump now has to win at least 60% of the upcoming delegates. Possible but highly unlikely.

As we march forward, the conservative media in Trump's pocket will do their best to create hysteria among the uneducated electorate about a contested convention. The rest of us will constantly remind our party that it was a contested convention that gave us President Abraham Lincoln on the third ballot.""

108728919161573_1144844122216709,"I ended the day yesterday just throwing my hands in the air and wondering if there will be anything left worth salvaging from this party's platform once Donald Trump gets done using it as his personal experiment.  Here are my thoughts on his latest comments.

""I want to be the first to say, as an incredibly strong proponent and protector of life, that I find Trump's remarks reprehensible and unrepresentative of me and the conservative movement as I've always known it.

I'm not pro-life just because I care about an unborn baby. I'm also pro-life because I've talked to too many women who have experienced the pain and anguish of abortion not to have an understanding that an enormous percentage of post abortive women are left suffering and wounded by their decision.  In fact, suicide rates among post abortion women are three to six times higher than the average person. 

Many people who suffer from a loss are able to openly discuss the hurt and grief and receive comfort among their friends and family, but an abortion sufferer is different.  The loss is associated with a shame that is too deep to announce as a status on Facebook.  They silently grieve and writhe in emotional pain, often tucked away for no one to ever see. 

So we have to ask ourselves how are we responding to women who are hurting from the result of an act that many of us so vociferously and passionately oppose?  The answer is simple.  They must not feel further condemnation or shame.  Many of you reading this profess to be Christians, as do I.  If you are, you are the hands, the feet, the mouths of the Savior that you profess to serve and you must respond as He would.  Believe me, there is nothing you can say to these women to make them feel lower about their decision than where they already are emotionally.  They have to live with this decision every day and I can assure you that if many of them had the opportunity for a redo that they would grasp it with both hands. 

Compassion.  Love.  Acceptance.  Forgiveness.  Mercy.  Grace.  These are the attributes we must embody when we encounter a woman hurting from the guilt and remorse of an abortion.

Are there people who should be punished for breaking a law?  Yes.  They are the profiteers in this industry who prey on women.  They peddle lies of free and inconsequential love and climb the ladders of wealth and success on the backs of wounded women and jars of fetuses.

To outsiders looking in, know this.  Trump is wrong.  This is not who we are as conservatives, this is not who we are as a party.  These comments are from a thoughtless, small thinker with an excruciatingly painful incomprehension of our values.

Meanwhile, the Democrat's files grow larger and heavier with ammo to use against us for years to come.  Trump is a cannon wound to our party that I fear we will never recover.  If one was thoughtful, they may think it could only be purposeful.  This is yet another reason I will #NeverTrump.  Let the damage be done under another party, another banner.  Not ours.""

""Since the Democrats scrounged up their ridiculous ""War on Women"" talking points years ago, I've been one of the conservative women proudly standing on the front lines and declaring how unequivocally false this mantra is.

This was a term coined by a sad party who has run out of ideas, and the few ideas that they forced down our throats have destroyed our economy and kept our country down…

…And then along came Donald Trump.

His professional life has been full of degrading women and insulting them as only successful due to their sex appeal. And while he lamely blames all of his past comments on a lack of a filter because he didn't know he'd ever run for president, he has continued this outrageous and derogatory behavior throughout his campaign.

His tiny man fingers have gained strength this election season by typing out the insulting and demeaning tweets against Megyn Kelly. Beyond calling her names, he had no method of dealing with a strong and powerful woman who refused to be controlled and consistently refused to back down or be put in her place.

His late night tweets to Kelly have been a reflection of his narcissistic personality and inability to control his impulses.

That's a scary thing to consider when pondering the position of the most powerful leader of the free world. Especially with the knowledge that other leaders in the world are strong females with whom POTUS has to deal with in a pragmatic and self-disciplined manner.

This disrespect of women is a theme that has run throughout Trump's campaign.

Corey Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager, has now been arrested and charged for battery against Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. His supporters have felt the liberty to behave in similar manners and have attacked women who are not supporting Trump. My hate mail for my stance against Trump is horrific and sometimes scary.

Democrats have been handed a priceless gift with Trump. For the first time, their ""War on Women"" mantra will hold merit. And I, and other women who see through the fraud, will remain silent when there is a call for defense by others in our party during a general election should Trump be our nominee.

I'm mortified by the so called 'strong women' in my party who have not repudiated this behavior.

A call to values and basic human decency is in order for the good of the Republican party and the United States of America.""

""Elitists never think rules apply to them. The man born with a silver spoon in his mouth is now swimming in an unfamiliar pond, full of fish not beholden to his every whim and demand. And he's not exactly sure how to handle it outside of vague and threatening warnings to the country.

Despite the narrative being driven by those in the Trump controlled media, 'almost getting a majority of the delegates' is NOT a win. We do not rule by large plurality of 30%-40%, either as a country or as a party. And if one fails to receive a majority of the delegate votes, a contested convention is a normal part of the process...

...Trump supporters, you need a civics lesson and here is a basic start. Take a deep breath and channel an adult. Voters do not elect our nominee. The party does. The party does not simply operate through a democratic process. The states get a choice but they must follow party rules and simply obtaining a large plurality is not enough for any one man to waltz off with the nomination. That doesn't change simply because Trump demand it to be so...

...This rule has always been in place to protect the party from any populist or totalitarian fascist hell bent on hijacking our platform in an effort to rewrite Republicanism under his own banner and brand.

We are not electing a class president. We are electing a man to the most important position of the free world and nominating him on a platform that has long stood for small government, individual freedom, and personal responsibility. A conservative platform that Trump has coincidentally rarely supported and still consistently rejects both in policy and in character.

In the event that Trump can gain the needed delegates, it will be a clear win and an uncontested convention that results in a mass exodus of conservative voters from the Republican party, unlike any we have ever seen.

Those of us who think with our brains and not with our ""feels"" have nothing in common with anything Trump represents. And whether he destroys the party and the country, or his nomination leads to a Hillary presidency, it will be done with our heady warnings but not our participation.

Until then, I am 100% behind the man who can keep Trump from gaining the necessary delegates and will work for the same kind of contested convention that didn't give us Republican nominee, Abraham Lincoln, until the third ballot. #NeverTrump

""..Men like Chris Christie and Ben Carson who spent the last year convincing us that they wouldn't sell out the American people if we would only entrust them with the White House, barely waited long enough for the ink to dry on their presidential candidacies' death certificates before they betrayed their promises of honour and ethics by endorsing Donald Trump.

Carson simpered and whined for months, begging for decorum among the candidates, and then in one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in this election season, also handed his endorsement to Trump — the vilest candidate who compared him to a pedophile just a short few months ago.

That wasn't just Carson's ""low energy"" we saw all of these months. That was a tangible observation of true weakness, a man with no spine or true courage of his convictions.

Over the last couple of weeks in the American political circus, we've watched as Trump vowed from the debate stage to commit war crimes and put our military men and women in harm's way. And nobody blinked an eye. We observed his flagrant disregard for the Separation of Powers when he warned that Paul Ryan would do as he was told or ""pay a big price.""

We watched his campaign manager allegedly assault a female journalist, who was left with bruises up and down her arm. We've seen multiple protesters beaten by thuggish rally attendees, egged on by the violent rhetoric and encouragement from their Dear Leader. We watched as that blood-thirsty rhetoric was read aloud by the debate moderator last Thursday night and the debate crowd cheered. They cheered.

And then America looked around them in shock as Trump rallies have erupted in riots — a clash between the Black Lives Matter movement and the other side of that same coin, the Trump phenomenon. This is what a Trump America will look like.

Now, the man who has been threatening attacks on our First Amendment and vowing to open libel laws to go after anyone who speaks against him, is ironically wringing his hands over free speech....""

I greatly admire Chris Salcedo for his willingness to have this conversation on air-you can listen to the clip at the end of the column.

""I have made it no secret on how I feel that Talk Radio has partnered with Donald Trump and betrayed the conservative movement and how the ""bastions of conservative truth tellers"" have exchanged their principles for ratings. While I'm a frequent talk radio guest and appreciate many of the finer things that they have done for our party and the vehicle that they've often been in disseminating important messages, I'm also not immune to the fact that this is an industry that has created massive amounts of profits by keeping the base angry at the federal government and often at our party...

Hosts like Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham, and Sean Hannity have capitalized largely on this platform. Their ratings, books sales, and social media boosts have come from an audience who relies far too much on their opinion and as such, have largely lost the ability to think for themselves. Mark Levin also is largely responsible for this monster we have on our hands. Fours years ago, in 2012, I wrote an article exposing Trump for the liberal that he is and Levin used it and circulated it as a warning to his audience not to get sucked in to the hype. This go around, Levin apparently had amnesia that conveniently coincided with his latest book release and was one of the bandwagoners of talk radio who defended and contributed to building this Trojan Horse.

These ""bastions of conservative truth tellers"" (as they love to tout themselves) have spent years and years bashing The Establishment and RINO's and yet, in the largest travesty of this election season, have literally prostituted their messages in regards to embracing and shilling for the biggest conman we've ever seen to hit politics... When it really matters, they are cowards. And I lay at their feet the responsibility for the destruction of conservatism that we are about to see. A rewriting of conservatism that no longer is representative of anything I will ever want to be a part.

Without them, Donald Trump would not be where he is today. It would have been impossible for him to make the advancement with the electorate with the shameless liberal record that he has, the blatant policy ignorance, and the obvious fraud that he wears as a shroud on his body. They've avoided asking him hard questions, refused to nail him down when he only answers with the same rhetoric over and over, they have destroyed good men in this race in order to make way for his elevation, and have given him more airtime than the rest of the candidates combined.""

""RINO. A term that people have been using to label people who are anti-Trumpers but originally used to identify people under a category who do not behave as one they claim to be. Because if one doesn't support the billionaire playboy, one must be a Republican In Name Only. Forget that he isn't a Republican- that's just a quiet little sidenote.

This election has brought a far more legitimate term to the table.

CINO. Christians In Name Only. The sector of ""evangelicals"" who have abandoned every Biblical admonition when seeking a leader and is far more of an appropriate term in this election.

Men and women who I personally know who attend church and teach Sunday School, never miss a Wednesday night service, and pride themselves on tithing- have suddenly decided that their treasured Biblical principles do not apply to their voting habits.

These same men and women have often eviscerated President Obama for being ""Muslim"" or not being Christian enough are willingly voicing the opinion that they will give ""The Donald"" the benefit of the doubt because he's scrounged up the dusty Bible that he picked up in his last hotel room and is shaking it on national television, pandering to shallow Christian thinkers all over the country.

They have lost the ability to think for themselves and have given their wills over to leaders in the Christian community who will go down in history as loosely tied to their convictions, beliefs, and morals and most likely have a mysterious boost in funds in some remote 501c3.

Men like Jerry Falwell Jr and Dr. Robert Jeffress have decided to throw their weight behind electing a man who has bragged that his personal Vietnam was dodging STD's, conducted multiple affairs that has left him with many splintered families, praises the leader of America's death culture on a regular basis, Planned Parenthood, cheated and scammed his way to wealth, has owned multiple strip clubs, and brags that he has never felt the need to ask God for forgiveness. This is a man who has been accused of sexual harassment twice as many times as Bill Clinton, a vulgar and profane man without any moral compass to guide any of his decisions, mocks the handicap, has proclaimed that he pushes for revenge as ""viciously and violently"" that he can, and has routinely verbally degraded women he comes in contact with.

....Let me be clear. I don't require a Christian president. But I do require a moral one.""

""Like a raging, nasty infection, Trumpmania spread through the United States on Super Tuesday, resulting in a win for Trump and a loss for conservatism.

And we've all been shoved along by these unpredictable waves of discontent, with no control over the 30% who have taken control of our party, using the splintered Republican field to their advantage. The adults have been locked out of the room, and the out-of-control toddlers have trashed the house.

Americans, driven by anger at the federal government and the vacuum of leadership within the Republican Party, are going down in history as selling their souls and future liberties to an authoritarian figure who tickles the ears and uses fear and manipulation as a tool for resentful voters...

...The gong has sounded. The clock has run out. Carson and Kasich have decided to go down in history as unforgivable contributions to this debacle. With some numbers so close, the rage poured from various aspects of the party at the thought that this could have been avoided if these vainglorious human beings weren't so addicted to self-promotion.

Beyond that, it is time for us to make the case for a two-man race. Cruz or Rubio has to drop in order for there to be any sort of viable battle for our party moving forward, and I imagine that will be the discussion that trends in American politics this next week.

My heart is sad for my party and for my fellow Republicans who have fought for conservatism as much as I. We are beginning to feel that the writing is on the wall and are having to ask ourselves the tough questions moving forward,: ""How committed are we to this party? Did we leave the party or has the party left us?""

Rubio finally demanded of Trump last night- often doing the job of the moderator as well as the job of a candidate. Putting Trump on spot and demanding answers, Rubio carried the water for the entire stage, bringing Trump to a red faced desperation with nothing left in his arsenal but his same lame insults on auto-loop. Rubio, in a beautiful dance of wit, outsmarted, outperformed, and slayed the dragon.

This pompous and ego driven man who loves to declare that he's self-made was speechless when Marco Rubio said what we've all be thinking. ""If he hadn't inherited $200 million you know where Donald Trump would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan."" Inheriting $200 million isn't exactly a pull yourself up by the bootstraps, self-made story that Trump would like to propagate. Fortune already declared that if Trump had simply invested his millions in index funds and spent his time in a corner playing with crayons and legos, instead of being involved, he'd be richer many times over.This is the debate that should have happened months ago. The 70% of Republicans who aren't hashtaging at #whitegenocide and who realize that the White House shouldn't be a bad rerun of Housewives of DC want answers. We want policy plans and substance- not promises of unicorns and sunshine– and we aren't so easily distracted by the one shiny diamond in your pocket you bring out when you're feeling awkward and insecure. The ""big, beautiful wall"" – that nobody will commit to pay for.

Despite the glorious taste of watching Trump being exposed as the biggest empty suit on the debate stage- the realist in me wonders if it's too little, too late. Trump supporters are incomparable to other human voters. Some can be recognized by their dazed looks, others by their swastika tattoos, and the rest as simply so angry at government that they've lost their critical thinking skills.

The rest of us watched an insecure man implode with anger and run off the debate stage as the emperor with no clothes right into his post-debate interview where he declared the reason he was being audited was because the government knows ""he's such a strong Christian.""

""My heart grieves for my country.

I look around me with despair and see well-intentioned people deceived and glibly cheering on the success of one of the most obvious tricksters we've ever seen run for president. A man who I feel is far more dangerous for freedom than anyone any ticket has ever offered. If you've followed me for any length of time, you understand what a giant statement that is.

I blame former Speaker of the House John Boehner and his weakness for creating a void large enough to usher in America's first fascist brought to you by the Republican party. Talk radio, which profits the most when the base is resentful and bitter, has helped fuel the anger. An uneducated electorate has eaten it up because they make decisions based on emotion instead of logic. They've lost the ability to think for themselves and instead regurgitate endless talking points fed to them by profiteers in the conservative media.....

...The massive anyone-but-Trump crowd is losing because we have a field of vanity-seekers full of delusions of grandeur who think they actually have a snowball's chance in hell of winning this election.

Ben Carson is a man I once liked but who now reminds me of the television show that's run 18 seasons too long. At this point, I find his desire for glory disgusting and narcissistic and I will have a hard time forgiving his part in this travesty.

John Kasich is another man driven by self-love and delusion who's become blind to the writing on the wall. History will find both of these men were given to vanity over country.

That leaves us with Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. For the love of country and the sake of freedom, one of them must get out before Super Tuesday. I have always been in Rubio's corner. He isn't the perfect candidate, but I've always believed he has the best chance to beat Hillary Clinton. But desperation to defeat Trump has me willing to embrace either man wholeheartedly and race with either to the finish line with 100% of my efforts behind them.

People have always wondered how dictators rise to power. It's just like this. Usually through a democratic process and fuelled by fear, paranoia and anger. At this point, forget the party. Someone has to save the country.""",Vanity-seekers damaging anyone-but-Trump push,link,http://www.torontosun.com/2016/02/24/vanity-seekers-damaging-anyone-but-trump-push,2016-02-25 09:40:23,3,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0

Donald Trump believes the federal government should fund Planned Parenthood. Donald Trump believes there are good things the child killers do. What is most damning is how so many are willing to be compromised by Donald Trump.

For eight years the conservative movement compromised itself as a wing of George W. Bush's Republican Party. The movement became ill defined and conservative became a synonym with Republican.

Already we are seeing pastors and religious leaders compromising their integrity to vote for Donald Trump. Jerry Falwell, Jr. has joined the whores of Moloch, defending Trump's Planned Parenthood statement on Twitter. Falwell presides over an institution that expels students who have abortions, but is willing to give positive lip service to Trump saying there are good things Planned Parenthood does.

If Trump were elected President, there would be members of the pro-life movement who would compromise their convictions for access to power.

If Trump were elected, portions of the conservative movement would compromise the movement to be one degree from Donald Trump. The intellectual institutions on which we have made our case for limited government and freedom would crumble.

Any man who has unequivocally stated that he has never felt the need to ask God for forgiveness, mocks those with degenerative diseases and behaves with such vulgarity and profanity, shows that he bears no fruit or characteristics of the faith with which he now conveniently lays claim to.

I want to leave some parting questions to South Carolina, the state who historically values their faith and votes their ethics. Do we trade our most basic senses of human decency for the empty promise of a wall? Do we sell our integrity for the cheap thrills of angry and chaotic outbursts that momentarily soothes our frustration? Is there no more room in American politics for prudence, pragmatism and self control?

Often red-faced and obviously forgetting he was supposed to act like a Republican in front of South Carolina primary voters he forgot to keep his crazy tucked in. In frequent spits of anger and loss of self-control he reminded voters that he is a 9/11 Truther and again flirted with the idea that President Bush was responsible for 9/11. In a speech he might have pulled straight from Pelosi's desk, he ranted that Bush should have been impeached for his decisions to go to war with Iraq. And, failing to remember he was in South Carolina, he insulted Senator Graham who was sitting in the audience- a man who might not be exceedingly popular among conservatives but who is beloved by South Carolina and voted into office over and over again.

Trump also spent time repeating the fallacy that we wouldn't be discussing immigration had he not entered the race and steered the conversation. A point I wished had been more central to the response was that had Trump not spent years and millions upon millions of dollars supporting liberal candidates like Pelosi and Reid, we would probably already have that wall in place.

If Saturday's debate did anything, my deep hope is that it reminded South Carolina voters the gravity with which is now tied to this nomination given the new bearing on the Supreme Court. Not just the need for a candidate that can beat Hillary Clinton by uniting all factions of the base and attracting the independents and moderates that we will need to win this general election, but a potential president who is deep, thoughtful, and purposeful in his understanding of the judicial ramifications moving forward. This is serious business for a serious person- not a 60-minute reality show looking for higher ratings with which to attract sponsors.

That statement revealed more about Carson to me than anything else I've learned from him during the campaign season...

...This schizophrenic election has turned previously predictable states upside down. South Carolina would historically never embrace a foul-mouthed, egomaniacal, godless man to represent their country as the leader of the free world.

It's my belief that this shift in momentum will result in New Hampshire voters who were planning a vote for the lower-tier candidates taking a step back and reconsidering where their votes are going to count the most, and I don't believe that will fall in Trump's favour. This has turned into a three-person race and if the structure for your ground game isn't already firmly in place, it's too late to embed it now.

New Hampshire voters have a different pulse. We just exited a state where the Bible and ethanol share centre stage and we are entering the Live Free or Die state; more fiscally tight-fisted and socially liberal.

While Iowa serves to make or break momentum, New Hampshire is significant in that it often determines who is going to break out as the consensus candidate.

Last night, Real Clear Politics added a new Iowa poll to their average. It's one that included voters polled on their cell phones, which doesn't usually happen.

Guess what? Rand Paul won outright among likely Republican caucus-goers between the ages of 18-29 and is tied for first among those surveyed on their mobile devices. 

Of those polled on landlines, Paul only garners 1.7% of the vote. But among those reached on cell phones his support is at a whopping 26.5%. Seems like Rand was right about the fact that his voters aren't being reached via traditional polling. 

What will that mean for tonight's caucus turnout? That's still anybody's guess. But this is good news for those hoping for Paul to do better than most polls show. It's also good news for the future of the GOP, generally speaking.

There is a warped idea going around this election that in order to reject political correctness we have to nominate someone who disgraces himself with racist and misogynistic rants, who mocks people with degenerative diseases, behaves like a drunken frat boy, and one who continually proves that he is a man without prudence, wisdom, or self-control.

Since when did we lose the idea that real leadership embodies integrity, humility and discernment?

It's a shortsighted sector that has allowed this to continue on as ""political entertainment"" without realizing the dire significance it will have on us as a party. The Republican party, which has long stood on a platform of smaller government, individual liberty, and personal freedom, has embraced a new mascot; one that stands for progressive tax rates, single-payer health care (which is so far to the left, even Obama couldn't get it passed), massive trade tariffs that will cripple our economy, and a radical shift from basic God-given property rights to the overreaching federal power of eminent domain.""

""To my revulsion, I've seen much backpedaling in my social media timeline this week from talking heads and conservative leaders who spent the last many months lauding, applauding, defending and shilling for this Trojan Horse in our party, Donald Trump.  They've used their pulpits, whether on the air or through online media, to extol the virtues and praises of this clown while attacking those of us who have carried their water for them for months.  They've exchanged their principles for click bait articles, book sales, Facebook likes and shares, and higher ratings.  They've used and peddled their influence for ill-gotten gains and mocked those of who have stood in the gaps, oftentimes at calling us ""RINO's and elitist"" as we've stood in the middle of the road while the traffic bears down us, waving the flag of remembrance in honor of the constitutional principles laid shredded in the wake of their profits.

These talking heads, commentators, political leaders among us constantly told us to shut up– that the Donald was was fantastic ""entertainment"" and fabulous for our party as he ""destroys political correctness.""  They laughed at his comments, encouraged his embarrassing and misogynistic rants, his heinous gestures mocking the handicap and those with degenerative diseases, and refused to repudiate his appalling behavior or put him on the line for his lifetime devotion to liberal policy.  This man, this authoritarian demagogue, one they should be renouncing on a daily basis as someone NOT representative in anyway of our Party, instead was embraced and made to feel at home.  We got hijacked by crazy profiteers that have totally forgotten why we exist as a party- and that is to elect conservative leaders to govern with a conservative philosophy.""

We've practiced that since the beginning of our marriage and made it a priority even during times that we've had very little and it was a stretch for us to do so and in the times we've had a lot and it was easy.  However, a few years ago we decided to do something different and here is OUR challenge to YOU!  Earn your own pair of angel wings this Christmas!

""A few days before Christmas, I arranged for our family to drop off our gifts.  That evening, we slowly drove into the slums of an area that we make an effort not to venture into for safety reasons, an area where you lock your car doors and don't look people in the eye.  I'd be lying if I didn't admit to being a little nervous about getting out of the car with my kids but as we pulled up to this little shack of a house, held together with duct tape and bubble gum, the mother opened the door with an enormous smile on her face.  We walked in through the front door and the cracked and peeling linoleum was spotless and smelled like Lysol, clean sheets covered a dilapidated couch, and an old tiny Christmas tree straight out of Charlie Brown's Christmas set lonely and quiet in the corner…with nothing under it.  Her baby girls stood on each side of her, freshly scrubbed clean with wet hair slicked back from their sweet little faces and dressed in what was obviously the very best in their closet."" #SHARE #Christmas2015",The Ultimate Christmas Challenge: A Life Changing Experience,link,http://www.libertyjuice.com/2015/12/08/the-christmas-challenge-that-wont-leave-you-the-same/,2015-12-09 11:03:25,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0
108728919161573_1071597332874722,"Make no mistake. A government that can shut down mosques simply because they are mosques can shut down Bible studies because they are Bible studies. A government that can close the borders to all Muslims simply on the basis of their religious belief can do the same thing for evangelical Christians.

A government that issues ID badges for Muslims simply because they are Muslims can, in the fullness of time, demand the same for Christians because we are Christians.

""It's in the middle of the night, my house is quiet, my family is sleeping and as inevitably happens, I can't sleep.  My thoughts are full of my mother.  This is a routine that has happened more frequently over the last 12 months.  But tonight, I lay quietly in my bed, softly typing in the dark the words that tumble in my emotional nightly thoughts.  The ones that are finally allowed to spring to life when the sounds of the day fade.  I don't know what I will do with them.  Share, shelve, delete.  Regardless, my emotions need to finally have a place to land and however God decides to use them will be up to what He puts in the heart of my family as we will decide together if this is something we are ready to share.""",Finding Joy In The Sorrow: My Sweet Mama and Alzheimer's,link,http://www.libertyjuice.com/2015/11/10/finding-joy-in-the-sorrow-my-sweet-mama-and-alzheimers/,2015-11-10 16:42:38,4,2,1,4,0,0,0,0,0

""I wish I had been enlightened like you before it was too late. I have to live with my choice everyday and it's hell on Earth.""

This is the other part of the abortion coin and one that is struggling to be heard above the arguing between the two sides. It's the ugly and heartbreaking reality that is hidden behind the catchy slogans of ""women's healthcare,"" the pink ""choice"" shirts, and the false rung of ""empowerment and strength"" on which modern day feminism is hung.

Compassion. Love. Acceptance. Forgiveness. Mercy. Grace. These are the attributes we must embody when we encounter a woman hurting from the guilt and remorse of an abortion.

Our fight against the abortion industry must continue with undying strength and vigor. But the other hand must tempered and used to welcome and comfort those who were blinded by false promises of free love and inconsequential actions.

108728919161573_1020034091364380,"Saturday, August 22nd, (tomorrow) will be the national day of protest against Planned Parenthood. 

ProtestPP is a coalition of pro-life groups calling for a National Day of Protest on August 22, 2015 at Planned Parenthood facilities all across America. Our goal is to raise awareness of the heartless and even illegal activities of Planned Parenthood by going to where the killing and harvesting of body parts from aborted children takes place. The four main sponsors are: Created Equal, the Pro-Life Action League, 40 Days for Life, and Citizens for a Pro-Life Society.

Creating a presence at neighborhood Planned Parenthood facilities is essential to inform the public about what is going on behind closed doors. Local sidewalk counselors and activists are a key component to shutting down Planned Parenthood in the long term.

The National Day of Protest will strengthen local efforts by raising their profile with the local press, the community and other pro-life activists. Together, the protests held on August 22 will put pressure on the media, both local and national, to report the truth about Planned Parenthood, and on government officials to stop funding this discredited organization.",Protest Locations,link,http://protestpp.com/protests/,2015-08-21 09:29:42,8,0,3,8,0,0,0,0,0
