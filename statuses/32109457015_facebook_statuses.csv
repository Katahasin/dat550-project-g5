""After a long absence, The Twilight Zone returns with one of the most ambitious, expensive and controversial productions in broadcast history. Sci-fi writers have dabbled often with alternative history stories—among the most common is the ""What If The Nazis Had Won The Second World War"" setting—but this huge interactive virtual reality project, which will unfold on TV, in the press, and on Twitter over the next four years, sets out to build an ongoing alternative present. The story begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in which huge sections of the U.S. electorate have somehow been duped into voting to make Donald Trump president. It sounds far-fetched, and it is, but as it goes on it becomes more and more chillingly plausible. Today's feature-length opener concentrates on the gaudy inauguration of President Trump, and the stirrings of protest and despair surrounding the ceremony, while pundits speculate gravely on what lies ahead. It's a flawed piece, but a disturbing glimpse of the horrors we could stumble into, if we're not careful.""",Trump Inauguration as 'Twilight Zone' Television Listing Goes Viral,link,http://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/01/17/trump-inauguration-twilight-zone-television-listing-goes-viral,2017-01-17 13:15:20,476,16,173,329,30,8,103,6,0

--The primary debates were scheduled at inopportune times, a move that many interpreted as protecting Clinton from scrutiny and attempting to prevent Sanders from gaining attention.

--The Democratic Party's superdelegates, a large majority of whom declared their support for Clinton long before voting occurred, are largely seen to have insulated her from Sanders' insurgent popularity among voters.

--The DNC has exploited a fundraising loophole to funnel funds raised for state-level candidates to the Clinton campaign.

--Widespread disenfranchisement in the Arizona and New York primaries, which went to Clinton, earned accusations of voter suppression from many observers.

--Sanders himself wrote to DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schulz (D-Fl.) to point out that the committee in charge of deciding the party platform and rules at this summer's national convention is ""stacked"" with ""Clinton loyalists.""","When the System Feels Rigged, How Surprising is Convention Mayhem?",link,http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/05/16/when-system-feels-rigged-how-surprising-convention-mayhem,2016-05-16 14:00:00,1108,109,629,817,4,6,3,42,236
