FSTV is the national, independent news network committed to advancing progressive social change. As the alternative to television networks owned by billionaires, governments, and corporations, our network amplifies underrepresented voices and those working on the front lines of social, economic, and environmental justice. 

ABOUT THE REVOLUTION WHERE YOU LIVE BOOK:

With the election of Donald Trump, we know that local resistance and renewal are more vital than ever. The Revolution Where You Live offers an inspiring look into the grassroots movement-building and innovation that is already taking place across the country -- outside of the conventional media view.

The book traces Sarah's 12,000 mile solo road trip across the U.S. in her tiny truck camper -- through rust belt cities, Native reservations, Appalachia, and the south. Camping along the way, taking time to meet with youth, elders, teachers, artists, activists and other local leaders, Sarah's ""slow journalism"" reporting journey offers a surprising and hopeful window into communities on the rise.

""I love that this book documents the incredibly powerful and dynamic movements that are taking root around the country. Read it!"" -- Mark Ruffalo, actor, director, and film producer

""Looking for hope? Here's where to find it. An inspiring account of the grassroots leaders throughout the United States who are confronting racism, the climate crisis, and poverty."" -- Van Jones, CNN cohost, author, and activist

""Jump into Sarah van Gelder's camper, and you'll see our country anew . . . just the book Americans need right now."" -- Frances Moore Lappé, author of Diet for a Small Planet

""The Revolution Where You Live couldn't have come at a better time. If Woody Guthrie had penned a book to go along with 'This Land Is Your Land,' it might have read like this."" -- David Bornstein, New York Times columnist

Sarah's national book tour and media events kick off this month. For a full schedule and additional details about the book, see: https://revolutionwhereyoulive.org/

ABOUT THE REVOLUTION WHERE YOU LIVE BOOK:

With the election of Donald Trump, we know that local resistance and renewal are more vital than ever. The Revolution Where You Live offers an inspiring look into the grassroots movement-building and innovation that is already taking place across the country -- outside of the conventional media view.

The book traces Sarah's 12,000 mile solo road trip across the U.S. in her tiny truck camper -- through rust belt cities, Native reservations, Appalachia, and the south. Camping along the way, taking time to meet with youth, elders, teachers, artists, activists and other local leaders, Sarah's ""slow journalism"" reporting journey offers a surprising and hopeful window into communities on the rise.

""I love that this book documents the incredibly powerful and dynamic movements that are taking root around the country. Read it!"" -- Mark Ruffalo, actor, director, and film producer

""Looking for hope? Here's where to find it. An inspiring account of the grassroots leaders throughout the United States who are confronting racism, the climate crisis, and poverty."" -- Van Jones, CNN cohost, author, and activist

""Jump into Sarah van Gelder's camper, and you'll see our country anew . . . just the book Americans need right now."" -- Frances Moore Lappé, author of Diet for a Small Planet

""The Revolution Where You Live couldn't have come at a better time. If Woody Guthrie had penned a book to go along with 'This Land Is Your Land,' it might have read like this."" -- David Bornstein, New York Times columnist

Sarah's national book tour and media events kick off this month. For a full schedule and additional details about the book, see: https://revolutionwhereyoulive.org/

ABOUT THE REVOLUTION WHERE YOU LIVE BOOK:

With the election of Donald Trump, we know that local resistance and renewal are more vital than ever. The Revolution Where You Live offers an inspiring look into the grassroots movement-building and innovation that is already taking place across the country -- outside of the conventional media view.

The book traces Sarah's 12,000 mile solo road trip across the U.S. in her tiny truck camper -- through rust belt cities, Native reservations, Appalachia, and the south. Camping along the way, taking time to meet with youth, elders, teachers, artists, activists and other local leaders, Sarah's ""slow journalism"" reporting journey offers a surprising and hopeful window into communities on the rise.

""I love that this book documents the incredibly powerful and dynamic movements that are taking root around the country. Read it!"" -- Mark Ruffalo, actor, director, and film producer

""Looking for hope? Here's where to find it. An inspiring account of the grassroots leaders throughout the United States who are confronting racism, the climate crisis, and poverty."" -- Van Jones, CNN cohost, author, and activist

""Jump into Sarah van Gelder's camper, and you'll see our country anew . . . just the book Americans need right now."" -- Frances Moore Lappé, author of Diet for a Small Planet

""The Revolution Where You Live couldn't have come at a better time. If Woody Guthrie had penned a book to go along with 'This Land Is Your Land,' it might have read like this."" -- David Bornstein, New York Times columnist

Sarah's national book tour and media events kick off this month. For a full schedule and additional details about the book, see: https://revolutionwhereyoulive.org/

ABOUT THE REVOLUTION WHERE YOU LIVE BOOK:

With the election of Donald Trump, we know that local resistance and renewal are more vital than ever. The Revolution Where You Live offers an inspiring look into the grassroots movement-building and innovation that is already taking place across the country -- outside of the conventional media view.

The book traces Sarah's 12,000 mile solo road trip across the U.S. in her tiny truck camper -- through rust belt cities, Native reservations, Appalachia, and the south. Camping along the way, taking time to meet with youth, elders, teachers, artists, activists and other local leaders, Sarah's ""slow journalism"" reporting journey offers a surprising and hopeful window into communities on the rise.

""I love that this book documents the incredibly powerful and dynamic movements that are taking root around the country. Read it!"" -- Mark Ruffalo, actor, director, and film producer

""Looking for hope? Here's where to find it. An inspiring account of the grassroots leaders throughout the United States who are confronting racism, the climate crisis, and poverty."" -- Van Jones, CNN cohost, author, and activist

""Jump into Sarah van Gelder's camper, and you'll see our country anew . . . just the book Americans need right now."" -- Frances Moore Lappé, author of Diet for a Small Planet

""The Revolution Where You Live couldn't have come at a better time. If Woody Guthrie had penned a book to go along with 'This Land Is Your Land,' it might have read like this."" -- David Bornstein, New York Times columnist

Sarah's national book tour and media events kick off this month. For a full schedule and additional details about the book, see: https://revolutionwhereyoulive.org/

ABOUT THE REVOLUTION WHERE YOU LIVE BOOK:

With the election of Donald Trump, we know that local resistance and renewal are more vital than ever. The Revolution Where You Live offers an inspiring look into the grassroots movement-building and innovation that is already taking place across the country -- outside of the conventional media view.

The book traces Sarah's 12,000 mile solo road trip across the U.S. in her tiny truck camper -- through rust belt cities, Native reservations, Appalachia, and the south. Camping along the way, taking time to meet with youth, elders, teachers, artists, activists and other local leaders, Sarah's ""slow journalism"" reporting journey offers a surprising and hopeful window into communities on the rise.

""I love that this book documents the incredibly powerful and dynamic movements that are taking root around the country. Read it!"" -- Mark Ruffalo, actor, director, and film producer

""Looking for hope? Here's where to find it. An inspiring account of the grassroots leaders throughout the United States who are confronting racism, the climate crisis, and poverty."" -- Van Jones, CNN cohost, author, and activist

""Jump into Sarah van Gelder's camper, and you'll see our country anew . . . just the book Americans need right now."" -- Frances Moore Lappé, author of Diet for a Small Planet

""The Revolution Where You Live couldn't have come at a better time. If Woody Guthrie had penned a book to go along with 'This Land Is Your Land,' it might have read like this."" -- David Bornstein, New York Times columnist

Sarah's national book tour and media events kick off this month. For a full schedule and additional details about the book, see: https://revolutionwhereyoulive.org/

ABOUT THE REVOLUTION WHERE YOU LIVE BOOK:

With the election of Donald Trump, we know that local resistance and renewal are more vital than ever. The Revolution Where You Live offers an inspiring look into the grassroots movement-building and innovation that is already taking place across the country -- outside of the conventional media view.

The book traces Sarah's 12,000 mile solo road trip across the U.S. in her tiny truck camper -- through rust belt cities, Native reservations, Appalachia, and the south. Camping along the way, taking time to meet with youth, elders, teachers, artists, activists and other local leaders, Sarah's ""slow journalism"" reporting journey offers a surprising and hopeful window into communities on the rise.

""I love that this book documents the incredibly powerful and dynamic movements that are taking root around the country. Read it!"" -- Mark Ruffalo, actor, director, and film producer

""Looking for hope? Here's where to find it. An inspiring account of the grassroots leaders throughout the United States who are confronting racism, the climate crisis, and poverty."" -- Van Jones, CNN cohost, author, and activist

""Jump into Sarah van Gelder's camper, and you'll see our country anew . . . just the book Americans need right now."" -- Frances Moore Lappé, author of Diet for a Small Planet

""The Revolution Where You Live couldn't have come at a better time. If Woody Guthrie had penned a book to go along with 'This Land Is Your Land,' it might have read like this."" -- David Bornstein, New York Times columnist

Sarah's national book tour and media events kick off this month. For a full schedule and additional details about the book, see: https://revolutionwhereyoulive.org/

ABOUT THE REVOLUTION WHERE YOU LIVE BOOK:

With the election of Donald Trump, we know that local resistance and renewal are more vital than ever. The Revolution Where You Live offers an inspiring look into the grassroots movement-building and innovation that is already taking place across the country -- outside of the conventional media view.

The book traces Sarah's 12,000 mile solo road trip across the U.S. in her tiny truck camper -- through rust belt cities, Native reservations, Appalachia, and the south. Camping along the way, taking time to meet with youth, elders, teachers, artists, activists and other local leaders, Sarah's ""slow journalism"" reporting journey offers a surprising and hopeful window into communities on the rise.

""I love that this book documents the incredibly powerful and dynamic movements that are taking root around the country. Read it!"" -- Mark Ruffalo, actor, director, and film producer

""Looking for hope? Here's where to find it. An inspiring account of the grassroots leaders throughout the United States who are confronting racism, the climate crisis, and poverty."" -- Van Jones, CNN cohost, author, and activist

""Jump into Sarah van Gelder's camper, and you'll see our country anew . . . just the book Americans need right now."" -- Frances Moore Lappé, author of Diet for a Small Planet

""The Revolution Where You Live couldn't have come at a better time. If Woody Guthrie had penned a book to go along with 'This Land Is Your Land,' it might have read like this."" -- David Bornstein, New York Times columnist

Sarah's national book tour and media events kick off this month. For a full schedule and additional details about the book, see: https://revolutionwhereyoulive.org/

ABOUT THE REVOLUTION WHERE YOU LIVE BOOK:

With the election of Donald Trump, we know that local resistance and renewal are more vital than ever. The Revolution Where You Live offers an inspiring look into the grassroots movement-building and innovation that is already taking place across the country -- outside of the conventional media view.

The book traces Sarah's 12,000 mile solo road trip across the U.S. in her tiny truck camper -- through rust belt cities, Native reservations, Appalachia, and the south. Camping along the way, taking time to meet with youth, elders, teachers, artists, activists and other local leaders, Sarah's ""slow journalism"" reporting journey offers a surprising and hopeful window into communities on the rise.

""I love that this book documents the incredibly powerful and dynamic movements that are taking root around the country. Read it!"" -- Mark Ruffalo, actor, director, and film producer

""Looking for hope? Here's where to find it. An inspiring account of the grassroots leaders throughout the United States who are confronting racism, the climate crisis, and poverty."" -- Van Jones, CNN cohost, author, and activist

""Jump into Sarah van Gelder's camper, and you'll see our country anew . . . just the book Americans need right now."" -- Frances Moore Lappé, author of Diet for a Small Planet

""The Revolution Where You Live couldn't have come at a better time. If Woody Guthrie had penned a book to go along with 'This Land Is Your Land,' it might have read like this."" -- David Bornstein, New York Times columnist

Sarah's national book tour and media events kick off this month. For a full schedule and additional details about the book, see: https://revolutionwhereyoulive.org/

Four out of ten U.S. workers are not working traditional 9-to-5 jobs. The shift toward independent or ""gig"" work has alternatively been painted as an empowering development in which workers take advantage of new technologies and creative attitudes toward work and an exploitative one, in which greedy corporations shift work from full-time jobs with benefits to low-pay, low-security gigs. It's surely both. 

At the same time, some of the most exciting grassroots organizing today is taking place among the most ""precarious"" workers. Excluded from traditional protections and isolated by app-based technology, they're joining together in ways both old and new to define themselves as a force and push for standards that could lead to a more liberated future for all of us.

ABOUT THE NEW BOOK: PEOPLE GET READY

""This is the most important work either of us has done in our careers.""

People Get Ready explains why the political upheaval of 2016 is just a glimpse at what is coming in the next two decades. The consequences of the technological revolution are about to hit hard: unemployment will spike as new technologies replace labor in the manufacturing, service, and professional sectors of an economy that is already struggling. The decline of work as we know it will hit at the worst moment imaginable: as capitalism fosters permanent stagnation, when the labor market is in decrepit shape, with declining wages, expanding poverty, mindless austerity, and scorching inequality. Only the dramatic democratization of our economy can address the existential challenges we now face. Yet, the US political process is so dominated by billionaires and corporate special interests, by corruption and monopoly, and a brain-dead corporate news media, that it stymies not just democracy but progress.

The great challenge of these times is to ensure that the tremendous benefits of technological progress are employed to serve the whole of humanity, rather than to enrich the wealthy few. We argue in People Get Ready that the United States needs a new economy in which revolutionary technologies are applied effectively to address environmental and social problems and used to rejuvenate and extend democratic institutions. Based on intense reporting, rich historical analysis, and deep understanding of the technological and social changes that are unfolding, we propose a bold strategy for democratizing our digital destiny—before it's too late—and unleashing the real power of the Internet, and of humanity.

""We circled amongst differing needs, desires, and agendas. Some of us went to #COP21 to support the Lummi. Some of us met with a Parisian choreographer to share visions for a grand salmon dance in the coming days. 

When we met later at a cafe, tensions ran high. I felt the palpable emotions of familiar stories: Our needs are not being met. Cathy Bellew, our fellow traveller and Lummi elder, reminded us of traditional ways to keep us in harmony. Debra D'Angelo offered an indigenous Hawaiian practice she has learned called Hoʻoponopono. We looked into each other's eyes and shared these words: 'I love you. I'm sorry. Forgive me.'

Saying and hearing these words of compassion had an extraordinary effect. Thank goodness for indigenous wisdom that hasn't been lost. It makes me wonder: What would happen if I would say those words to the Earth—and really mean it? 'I love you. I'm sorry. Forgive me.'

How might it change me? What would happen if we all did?

YES! is looking for stories that address useful solutions at all levels, from policies to communities to individuals. We're especially interested in stories that show creative solutions already in place.

Dec. 6th, 2015

""Today Salmon Is Life joined indigenous peoples from all four corners of the globe on a voyage on the Seine. #PaddleToParis was a historic moment, proclaiming the first bioregional marine sanctuary in the world.

We were invited to come to the event early to tie the salmon to the railings of the barge and add to the ambience. Since people aren't allowed to gather in public spaces, renting a private barge was a way for those working together to protect nature and #indigenous cultures to meet face-to-face. This was the first in-person meeting for many of us who have been working on this shared vision. 

We watched delegates sign a canoe paddle, affirming the proclamation. When Candido Mezua, one of the Embera chiefs, offered us the paddle to sign, we were stunned. 

We were treated to beautiful Parisian food and incredible conversation. We then traveled with attendees to their ceremony at a castle in Millemont, on the outskirts of Paris, where indigenous people from all over the world have gathered together for the past week. 

Chief Phil Lane Jr. and Mona Pollaca led a ceremony that called on each of us to acknowledge the sacrifices that indigenous people in the room and across the globe have made—and continue to make—to protect Mother Earth and future generations.  

Chief Phil shared a Coast Salish word, Nawtsamaat. It means 'One home. One heart. One prayer. United in power to protect the sacred.' ""

Outside Notre Dame. Some security presence but nothing overwhelming. Watching the exhibitions being assembled for #COP21, and the preparations look amazing — from solar trees to green housing to projections of Paris in 2050. My anticipation is building. 

There are ads everywhere about the COP #climatealks. We've heard some worried comments from Parisians about how it's is not a good time for this. Use of tear gas and house arrests of some protesters have made even us uneasy. Other groups like the indigenous tribunal are doing direct nonviolent action, but of course the focus will be on radicals hoping for a productive tomorrow.""

This #NewEconomy panel, kicking off #NewEconomyWeek, was co-hosted by the New Economy Coalition and YES! Magazine:

http://neweconomy.net/events/online-panel-%E2%80%94-using-c-word-will-new-economy-be-capitalism-or-something-else

FEATURING:
Gar Alperovitz (Next System Project)
Sohnie Black (Fund for Democratic Communities)
John Fullerton (Capital Institute)
Julie Matthaei (Wellesley College)
Keith Harrington (YES! Magazine / Moderator)

Does building a truly just, democratic and sustainable economy mean creating an entirely new system beyond capitalism—or can we reform capitalism to operate according to those values?

This is an important strategic question that new-economy advocates must come to terms with as we attempt to build public understanding of and support for a just and sustainable new system. Indeed, as the first Democratic presidential debate of the season highlighted, ""capitalism"" can be a politically charged and confusing term. Thus, as with all controversial terms, how we use the ""c-word"" matters.

Yet, as one might expect from a diverse and growing movement, new-economy advocates have widely differing views on the term. Thus, for example, while Gar Alperovitz may write of an America Beyond Capitalism, we see his friend and colleague John Fullerton promoting a Regenerative Capitalism that nonetheless resonates with Alperovitz's vision in its particulars. Some feel the need to qualify our current system as ""corporate"" capitalism, while others are happy to call it capitalism, plain and simple. Yet in each case the choice of terminology is a deliberate one, indicating that the differences are not merely semantic, but reflect deeper political and cultural realities that no advocate should ignore.

NEW ECONOMY WEEK (JAN 9 -13)

This New Economy Week panel will serve as a live installment of Keith Harrington's "" Checkerboard Revolution"" series of articles for YES! Magazine, which explores big picture strategic issues confronting the emerging new-economy movement: 
http://www.yesmagazine.org/@@also-by?author=Keith+Harrington

To shed light on this often murky issue, an expert panel will discuss varying views of capitalism from the perspective of theory and practice. The discussion will not necessarily aim to build consensus around a particular definition of capitalism, but will attempt to help participants develop a more strategic understanding of the concepts, beliefs and values we evoke when we use the c-word.

Keith Harrington's AMA: 
""I'm an economist who believes that everyday revolutionaries (local economic innovators) can take down corporate capitalism — but only if they develop a shared vision. Ask me anything.""


Background: 

Corporate capitalism continues to dish up fresh crises from financial chaos to growing inequality, high unemployment, and ecological destruction. Meanwhile, everyday revolutionaries are already fighting back, building alternatives in their communities — from credit unions to worker-owned businesses and community wealth-building projects. Together, these democratic, sustainable alternatives could add up to a new system beyond capitalism. But old divisions over revolutionary strategy are holding changemakers back from discovering their true transformative power. I believe the way around this impasse and toward a new system can be found in the methods of jazz improvisation.

We are thrilled to have two talented and experienced young journalists join our crew for this next year: Seattle-based Marcus Green will be our first-ever full-time Reporting Fellow; and Dallas-based Jasmine Aguilera joins us as a Social Justice Correspondent.  

More on each of them below. Welcome Marcus and Jasmine!!

YES! REPORTING FELLOW — MARCUS GREEN: 

Growing up in the historically underreported area of Seattle's Rainier Beach neighborhood taught Marcus a valuable lesson on the effect media coverage has on the general perception of communities of color and also on how they see themselves. This led him eventually to found the South Seattle Emerald, a nonprofit publication that strives to provide comprehensive coverage of the south Seattle region. As he puts it: ""So much of the coverage about our area focuses on death, missing all the life being lived here."" At that publication startup, Marcus served as senior writer, executive director, editor-in-chief, and janitor -- often all at the same time.

Marcus decided to go into journalism after an earlier career in the hedge fund investment world. Journalism provided him an avenue to write about his passions: speaking truth to power and reminding the powerless that they actually aren't powerless. A longtime fan of YES! Magazine (even before his foray into journalism), he describes this fellowship opportunity as a dream come true. In this year, he hopes to produce insightful and innovative articles that spur civic dialogue and social change. When he doesn't have his head in a book or hand on a pen, Marcus enjoys hiking. He attempts  to learn at least one new thing every day.

YES! SOCIAL JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT — JASMINE AGUILERA: 

Currently based in Dallas. Jasmine grew up in the border town of El Paso, Texas. She has worked in El Paso, Washington D.C., Dallas and Tucson, Arizona with a variety of publications, including The Dallas Morning News and the New York Times. 

She's passionate about a variety of social issues and has covered immigration extensively, utilizing her border city background. But she is also very passionate about reporting on gender issues, poverty, race and any social issue that isn't getting the attention it deserves. She's looking forward to the opportunity to do solutions-oriented reporting, which she hasn't been able to do in the larger mainstream press. While at YES! Jasmine hopes to tell stories that have not yet been told and bring awareness to the people who are working for a better world in creative ways. She uses multimedia techniques to augment her stories.",Photos from YES!

""No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.""",It's legal!

Much as we might like to forget it, the United States was founded on a base of slavery and the brutal dispossession of Native Americans. The wounds to those groups have never been healed; in fact have been repeated through segregation, attempts to destroy language and culture, and exclusion from the economic system. Our entire society suffers as we try to hide or deny this painful reality.

The Summer 2015 issue of YES! explores how we can face the truth and take the first steps toward making things right. Please help us choose the cover for that issue.

ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE HAPPINESS BOOK:

Start your new year (and New Year's resolutions) off right with insights from some of the most inspiring and eloquent thinkers we've worked with on the meaning, and pursuit, of happiness. 

Contributors like the Story of Stuff's Annie Leonard, restorative justice expert Fania Davis, buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, and biodiversity advocate Vandana Shiva help us question — what is true happiness if it doesn't include the happiness of others and the health of a living planet?

""I love this beautiful compilation of voices reminding us that happiness isn't something we 'find.' It's what we become as we align our lives with thriving community and life-giving earth."" — Frances Moore Lappé, best-selling author

""Somehow a working planet, a thriving society, and a satisfying personal life are hitched together--and this fine volume offers powerful clues on the search for those connections!"" — Bill McKibben, author and environmental leader

""The Sustainable Happiness volume delivers inspiration for your personal journey of joy and well-being as you navigate 'the pursuit of happiness' in a deeply troubled world. Read this book for the wisdom it contains. It will nourish your soul."" — Parker J. Palmer, author of Healing the Heart of Democracy, Let Your Life Speak, and A Hidden Wholeness

ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE HAPPINESS BOOK:

Start your new year (and New Year's resolutions) off right with insights from some of the most inspiring and eloquent thinkers we've worked with on the meaning, and pursuit, of happiness. 

Contributors like the Story of Stuff's Annie Leonard, restorative justice expert Fania Davis, buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, and biodiversity advocate Vandana Shiva help us question — what is true happiness if it doesn't include the happiness of others and the health of a living planet?

""I love this beautiful compilation of voices reminding us that happiness isn't something we 'find.' It's what we become as we align our lives with thriving community and life-giving earth."" — Frances Moore Lappé, best-selling author

""Somehow a working planet, a thriving society, and a satisfying personal life are hitched together--and this fine volume offers powerful clues on the search for those connections!"" — Bill McKibben, author and environmental leader

""The Sustainable Happiness volume delivers inspiration for your personal journey of joy and well-being as you navigate 'the pursuit of happiness' in a deeply troubled world. Read this book for the wisdom it contains. It will nourish your soul."" — Parker J. Palmer, author of Healing the Heart of Democracy, Let Your Life Speak, and A Hidden Wholeness

ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE HAPPINESS BOOK:

Start your new year (and New Year's resolutions) off right with insights from some of the most inspiring and eloquent thinkers we've worked with on the meaning, and pursuit, of happiness. 

Contributors like the Story of Stuff's Annie Leonard, restorative justice expert Fania Davis, buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, and biodiversity advocate Vandana Shiva help us question — what is true happiness if it doesn't include the happiness of others and the health of a living planet?

""I love this beautiful compilation of voices reminding us that happiness isn't something we 'find.' It's what we become as we align our lives with thriving community and life-giving earth."" — Frances Moore Lappé, best-selling author

""Somehow a working planet, a thriving society, and a satisfying personal life are hitched together--and this fine volume offers powerful clues on the search for those connections!"" — Bill McKibben, author and environmental leader

""The Sustainable Happiness volume delivers inspiration for your personal journey of joy and well-being as you navigate 'the pursuit of happiness' in a deeply troubled world. Read this book for the wisdom it contains. It will nourish your soul."" — Parker J. Palmer, author of Healing the Heart of Democracy, Let Your Life Speak, and A Hidden Wholeness

WHAT: Seattle Book Launch & Reception
WHERE: Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Avenue, Seattle, WA 98122 -- downstairs event space
WHEN: Monday, January 12, 7 p.m.

ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE HAPPINESS BOOK:

Start your new year (and New Year's resolutions) off right with insights from some of the most inspiring and eloquent thinkers we've worked with on the meaning, and pursuit, of happiness. 

Contributors like the Story of Stuff's Annie Leonard, restorative justice expert Fania Davis, buddhist Matthieu Ricard, and biodiversity advocate Vandana Shiva help us question — what is true happiness if it doesn't include the happiness of others and the health of a living planet?

""I love this beautiful compilation of voices reminding us that happiness isn't something we 'find.' It's what we become as we align our lives with thriving community and life-giving earth."" — Frances Moore Lappé, best-selling author

""Somehow a working planet, a thriving society, and a satisfying personal life are hitched together--and this fine volume offers powerful clues on the search for those connections!"" — Bill McKibben, author and environmental leader

""The Sustainable Happiness volume delivers inspiration for your personal journey of joy and well-being as you navigate 'the pursuit of happiness' in a deeply troubled world. Read this book for the wisdom it contains. It will nourish your soul."" — Parker J. Palmer, author of Healing the Heart of Democracy, Let Your Life Speak, and A Hidden Wholeness
