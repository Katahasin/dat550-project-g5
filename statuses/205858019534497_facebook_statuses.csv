205858019534497_902645639855728,"A WISE CONSERVATIVE FATHER

A young woman was about to finish her first year of college. Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat, and was very much in favor of the redistribution of wealth.

She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harbored an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his.

One day she was challenging her father on his opposition to higher taxes on the rich and the addition of more government welfare programs. The self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the truth and she indicated so to her father. He responded by asking how she was doing in school.

Taken aback, she answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and let him know that it was tough to maintain, insisting that she was taking a very difficult course load and was constantly studying, which left her no time to go out and party like other people she knew. She didn't even have time for a boyfriend, and didn't really have many college friends because she spent all her time studying.

Her father listened and then asked, ""How is your friend Audrey doing?"" She replied, ""Audrey is barely getting by. All she takes are easy classes, she never studies, and she barely has a 2.0 GPA. She is so popular on campus; college for her is a blast. She's always invited to all the parties, and lots of times she doesn't even show up for classes because she's too hung over.""

Her wise father asked his daughter, ""Why don't you go to the Dean's office and ask him to deduct a 1.0 off your GPA and give it to your friend who only has a 2.0. That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA.""

The daughter, visibly shocked by her father's suggestion, angrily fired back, ""That wouldn't be fair! I have worked really hard for my grades! I've invested a lot of time, and a lot of hard work! Audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree. She played while I worked my tail off!""

Both of her parents, Democratic Party members, were standing there so I asked her, ""If you were President what would be the first thing you would do?"" She replied... ""I'd give food and houses to all the homeless people.""
Her parents beamed with pride! ""Wow...what a worthy goal!""
I said...""But you don't have to wait until you're President to do that!"" ""What do you mean?"" she replied. So I told her, ""You can come over to my house and mow the lawn, pull weeds,
and trim my hedge and I'll pay you $50. Then you can go over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the $50 to use toward food and a new house."" She thought that over for a few seconds, then she looked me straight in the eye and asked, ""Why doesn't the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him the $50?""
