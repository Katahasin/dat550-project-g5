When you tell people who don't share your tired old Cold War blinders, and are attracted to a self-described socialist, that they can't really be serious, that they can't really expect to win, because…well, there's just too much opposition to socialism—you just might provoke some heated debate.

The deference of U.S. Internet servers to the National Security Agency, in the latter's surveillance of all of our lives, can perhaps be seen as one contemporary example of state-corporate merger. So is the marriage of the State Department and the news industry, which is essentially controlled by only six corporations. Every report on 'the crisis in Ukraine,' for example, employs State Department talking points without question. Thus a coup spearheaded by neo-fascists toppling a democratically elected president becomes a popular movement toppling a corrupt dictator.""","The Daily Chimp for Tuesday, 25 August 2015 | The Smirking Chimp",link,http://www.smirkingchimp.com/dailychimp/63561/tue-25-aug-2015,2015-08-25 10:08:36,7,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,0

The left, as disorganized as it is, is the source of ideas, energy and passion for a party that is an empty vessel of corporate sloganeering. The left spawns the movements and ideas—LGBT and reproductive rights, income inequality, national healthcare, climate justice, police and prison reform, antiwar—that both form and motivate the Democratic base. That's where the Democrats draw their votes from, but the party needs money from corporations and plutocrats to run its machinery and to play its part in what is projected to be a $5 billion presidential campaign.

And, a few days before Christmas, an enterprising Indiana police officer named Jason Barthel, who is a 13-year veteran of the Mishawaka Police Department, and is also the owner of South Bend Uniform Co., has come up with a new t-shirt to support his fellow police officers, and, not so coincidentally to make some money. The t-shirt's message: 'Breathe Easy, Don't Break the Law.'""","The Daily Chimp for Monday, 5 January 2015 | The Smirking Chimp",link,http://www.smirkingchimp.com/dailychimp/60336/mon-05-jan-2015,2015-01-05 12:29:11,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0
218610566124_10152947406011125,"Bob Burnett in Saturday's Chimp: ""Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush would represent the business conservative wing of the GOP -- Pew Research estimates this is 12 percent of likely voters. Bush would be the favorite of the big GOP spenders, the one percent that favors capitalism over democracy. Jeb's strengths are national name recognition, personable manner, Hispanic spouse, and reputation for moderation on social issues. His weaknesses: high unfavorability ratings and he appears too moderate for many Republicans. His likely platform: make America safe for big business, lower taxes and remove regulations. His slogan (before the Republican convention): 'I'm as conservative as these other guys;' his slogan (after the GOP convention): 'I'm not as conservative as those other Republicans.' Among business conservatives, Jeb Bush has three likely opponents: Chris Christie, Rick Perry, and Mitt Romney. All three have more baggage than Bush: Christie has a reputation as a sleazebag, Perry as an airhead who doesn't understand national politics, and Romney as a two-time loser.""","The Daily Chimp for Saturday, 3 January 2015 | The Smirking Chimp",link,http://www.smirkingchimp.com/dailychimp/60314/sat-03-jan-2015,2015-01-03 13:12:09,9,1,1,9,0,0,0,0,0

And they do. They create ever greater wealth for the people at the top of the heap. Anyone who points that out, however, is engaging in 'class warfare,' just as anyone who points out the racism that is the glue binding the right wing together is playing 'the race card,' and is therefore, a 'racist.' In the tradition of the Big Lie, they repeat that certifiable nonsense over and over, and the schnooks take the bait, again and again, voting against their self interest, and for the interests of the people who wouldn't piss on them if they were on fire, but happily trickle on them most any other time.""","The Daily Chimp for Friday, 2 January 2015 | The Smirking Chimp",link,http://www.smirkingchimp.com/dailychimp/60303/fri-02-jan-2015,2015-01-02 10:37:25,12,2,2,12,0,0,0,0,0
