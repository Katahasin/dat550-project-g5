While Donald Trump has published a number of tweets about Russia in the past few week, none of them have been about the hundreds of journalists and protesters arrested by Russian authorities during peaceful protests across that country this past Sunday.

Trump has been prolific, however, in tweeting about Russia when it comes to attempting to divert attention from the ongoing House and Senate Intelligence Committee investigations of Trump, his family, and his staff.

This continues an ongoing theme with Trump in which he will criticize anyone, especially US allies, but not ever Vladimir Putin or Russia.

60190486539_10154206708101540,"Manafort, Manafort, Manafort.

Nothing points out how clearly over-his-head, and out of control, Trump is than the tale of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort. Manafort, you'll recall, was forced to leave the Trump campaign last summer, after increasing reports about his high-paid work for pro-Putin forces in Ukraine.

Yesterday, the Associated Press reported that during his previous consulting work, Manafort had a $10 million per year contract to help push Putin's foreign policy in Europe and America.

Spicer's response: 1) That Manafort guy, never heard of him. 2) Who cares what Manafort did before he joined the campaign.

No, Spicer didn't actually say he didn't know Manafort, but he has said for days that Manafort had only a small, short-lived, incidental at best role on the Trump campaign. In fact, Manafort ran the Trump campaign as its chairman.

As for Spicer's second point, that nobody cares what Manafort did before he joined the Trump campaign — ""to dredge up someone's work from a decade ago,"" to quote Spicer — is insane. I can't imagine hiring a top campaign staffer who ostensibly did work for Vladimir Putin (or in Manafort's case, to be accurate, worked for a Russian oligarch who was a top friend-of-Putin, in order to push Putin's foreign policy in Europe and America). It stretches credulity to suggest that a presidential campaign would ever let someone like this work as a top adviser, let alone the man running the entire campaign. And the notion that the campaign wouldn't want to know that Manafort was palling around with FOPs (friends of Putin) to the tune of $10m per year? Dear lord.

It should be assumed that Spicer, while seemingly channeling Melissa McCarthy, is actually channeling Donald Trump. Trump is clearly demanding that Spicer defend him and his at all costs, to hell with what's best for truth, adminstration or America. Thus Spicer's recent defense of Michael Flynn, and now Spicer's weird claim that Manafort's previous work promoting Putin's foreign policy is somehow not relevant.

And all of this comes back to Trump's temperament. A better politician, a more sane man, would have vetted his campaign staff better, and would have known better how to respond to such controversies now that they're out of the bag. A lesser man feeds those controversies, and ultimately helps to destroy his own presidency.

As you know, Donald Trump hasn't paid taxes for 18 years. Trump was the only major party presidential candidate in recent history not to make his tax returns public. And soon, Trump will be the only president in recent history not to release his tax returns come April 15.

Trump's taxes would go a long ways towards explaining the depths of his financial ties to Russia — remember, Trump's son said a few years back that a lot of their business was with Russia, yet now Trump himself denies it — and it would give us a window into all of the Trump empire's shady business deals in other countries.

""The maliciousness of this White House has people worried… that's why I'm not going to do it much longer, the impersonation, I don't know how much more people can take it.""

Donald Trump's White House has been caught trying to influence​ the FBI RussiaGate investigation.

Please add you name to those demanding the Justice Department appoint a special counsel (formerly known as ""independent counsel"") to investigate Trump's ties to Russia.

The Attorney General has the power​ to appoint a special counsel when the AG ""determines that a criminal investigation is warranted and that an investigation by the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest or 'other extraordinary circumstance' and that 'under the circumstances it would be in the public interest to appoint and outside Special Counsel.'""

Now that the Trump White House has been caught trying to influence the FBI investigation​ into ties between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, we must have a special counsel who is independent and whose investigation cannot be pressured by Donald Trump.

Not only is the current investigation untenable because Attorney General Jeff Sessions works for Donald Trump — how can Sessions fairly investigate his own boss? — but Jeff Sessions was part of Trump's campaign, and has an inherent conflict of interest as his investigation of the Trump campaign could end up being an investigation of the Attorney General himself.

Sessions must cede authority over the Russia investigation to a special counsel.

In fact, the FBI and other agencies were and are investigating just that question, whether and to what degree there were contacts between Trump's associates and Russian intelligence during the campaign. So the FBI refused.

If Donald Trump is now alleging that there was massive voter fraud in the 2016 election, then why did Trump's lawyer argue in court, on Trump's behalf, that there was no significant fraud in the election? 

If Trump is right, and there is massive fraud, and Trump's lawyers knowingly lied in official court documents, they could face professional and even legal sanctions — possibly even perjury charges.

And if Trump's lawyers were telling the truth in court, and there was no massive voter fraud in 2016, then Donald Trump lied last night, and White House press secretary Sean Spicer lied (again) today, when they averred that up to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election.

Trump White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer lied to the American people yesterday on national TV. As Spicer himself noted just a few weeks ago: There is one rule the press secretary always must follow, never lie.

Yet Spicer lied. And now he must resign.

Spicer's multiple lies came in a tirade yesterday about the poor attendance at Trump's inaugural. Many media outlets accurately reported that while President Obama had 1.8 million attendees at his inaugural in 2009, and 1 million in 2013, Donald Trump had far fewer (the latest estimate is around 160,000 for Trump).

The poor turnout numbers so incensed Trump that he groused about them, calling the media liars, while speaking at the CIA memorial wall for agents who died in the line of duty. This was followed by Spicer holding his first press conference at the White House as press secretary, in which Spicer angrily repeated the same lies.

2. As we saw during the election, as Trump's favorability drops, Republicans in Congress will grow more bold in challenging him (as will Democrats).
3. A bolder Congress is more willing to publicly challenge Trump.
4. A challenged Trump is a less effective Trump.
5. A less effective Trump does less harm and has a harder time getting re-elected.

How to unleash Trump's inner unlikeability? Focus on his insecurity. Trump's psyche is a terrifyingly open book. Much has been written by therapists discussing what psychological problems Trump might suffer from, but it's obvious to everyone that the man is breathtakingly insecure about his place in the world — he needs the approval of others, and nothing is ever enough — and that is where we start.

60190486539_10153972506141540,"Will Trump join Putin's international white nationalist movement?

Austria's Nazi-founded Freedom Party has been busy.

Not only did the far-right anti-immigrant party recently sign a ""cooperation pact"" with Russian president Vladimir Putin; but the leader of the Freedom Party, Heinz-Christian Strache, was just in New York City paying homage to Il Duce, Jr., Donald Trump's embattled National Security Adviser, and resident conspiracy-theorist-adherent, Gen. Michael Flynn.

Even more troubling is what McMullin suggests, that this is part of an effort by Vladimir Putin to create an ""international white nationalist movement."" And while it might at first seem out of sorts for a Russian leader to ally with white nationalists (Russian history and culture is decidedly anti-Nazi because of Russia's harrowing experience with Hitler in World War II), this wouldn't be the first time Putin used neo-Nazi movements to advance his policy goals. For years, Putin used Russian and Ukrainian neo-Nazis to further his anti-LGBT policies.

Is the Flynn meeting Trump's first step in joining Vladimir Putin's white nationalist cooperation pact?

An excerpt of my take:

Mike Pence got booed by the audience, and then schooled in democracy by the cast, while attending Hamilton the Musical last night in New York City. Which sent Donald Trump into an over-the-top Twitter tear this morning.

Authoritarians, you see, don't like to be challenged....

What so incensed Donald Trump isn't the content of the words, it's the fact that a ragtag collection of queers and colored people dared address the King at all.

Donald Trump is an authoritarian. He isn't used to being challenged. And when he is challenged, he's accustomed to using his adoring mob, or the threat of lawyers, to shut down even the whiff of opposition. Trump's entire adult life has been one huge safe space, where money creates the false patina of a respect long denied.

But art, like history, has no safe spaces. The story of America is about common folks speaking truth to power. Two hundred and forty years ago, a mixed-race immigrant to New York named Alexander Hamilton served as George Washington's top aide in the War of Independence. Hamilton, like the rest of our nation's founders and first citizens, chose to bow down before no king.

Hamilton's spiritual descendants, at a show honoring his life and his ideals, chose not to spare our elected leaders from witnessing a people's cry to breathe free. For that, they owe no man an apology.

The United States may be under attack this election day — an attack on the Internet.

Level3, a major Tier 1 carrier and one of the largest Internet providers in the world, experienced an unusual number of capacity problems this morning, starting at around 7am ET.

Something happened that threatened to bring the Internet to a crawl in key cities across the US, with a particular focus on the swing states of Florida, the east coast, and parts of the midwest.

While it's possible there's a benign technical reason for the Internet to suddenly lose capacity, it's also possible, a tech expert tells me, that the US is facing a denial of service attack.

The incident reached a peak at around noon Eastern Time, and appeared to be subsidizing for a while, but now has returned to full force.

Donald Trump's wife Melania was interviewed the other night by CNN's Anderson Cooper.

While Melania is typically shy of being in the public eye (though she was once a model), the Trump campaign apparently felt that they didn't have a choice. With 9 women now publicly accusing Trump of sexually harassing and/or assaulting them, the Trump campaign felt they needed to push back with ""the good wife.""

Melania is played by actress Laura Benanti, who is just a hoot.

Everyone has been abuzz the past few days about Donald Trump, and his surrogates (Giuliani and Gingrich come to mind), claiming that the election may be stolen from him.

But what folks may not have noticed is that this isn't the first time Trump has claimed a rigged election.

First Trump apologized for what he said in the video, then he claimed the entire thing was a ""distraction"" and that Bill and Hillary are far worse.

Trump's ""defiant tone,"" as CNN's Brian Stelter called it, made clear that the GOP candidate thinks he's the victim in all of this. Even the way Trump apologized, saying that he was sorry for what he said in the video, but making no mention of being sorry for what he did, or at least alleged that he did: sexually assaulting women.

As background, the Alt-Right are white supremacists, many of whom have a reverence for vulgar Nazi imagery, who also have issues with women, gays, Muslims and Jews. And Breitbart is the Web site of Donald Trump's campaign manager Stephen Bannon. Brannon bragged earlier this summer that Breitbart was ""the platform for the alt-right."" So this story directly reflects on the Trump campaign.

The profile alleges that Yiannopoulos said that the last time he was in Los Angeles, he was picked up at a bar by a man who gave him $10,000 after a night of sex. Yiannopoulos says the man gave him another $10,000 following a second evening of fun. According to new stories, Yiannopoulos was in Los Angeles as recently as this past May 31 (possibly later).

Social media is a de facto extension of an organization's communications team. It ought to be de jure. In the past, only the comms team, media office, and/or press secretary could speak on behalf of the organization to the outside world. With the advent of social media, that's all changed. We've empowered often- recent college grads in their early 20s — with little to no training in public relations, but who give good tweet — to speak publicly on behalf of an organization.

Is it any wonder that mistakes then follow?...

Part of the solution may be treating social media as media, and ensuring that social media staff have the kind of ongoing media training that other spokespeople have at an organization. Social media staff need to fully appreciate the gravity of their work, the potential for things to go horribly wrong, and that it's always more important to get it right than first. This is especially true when you work for an organization, like AP, that is built on a reputation of being the gold standard for truth and accuracy....

Two representatives of the Russian Green Party eviscerated American Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein today for her cozy relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin.

The Russian Greens said Stein was a willing accomplice of Putin's human rights abuses against the LGBT community, environmentalists, artists, journalists and political dissidents:

""By silencing Putin's crimes you are silencing our struggle. By shaking his hand and failing to criticize his regime you are becoming his accomplice. By forgetting what international solidarity means you are insulting the Russian environmental movement.""

In particular, Russian environmental activists Yevgeniya Chirikova and Nadezda Kutepova criticized Stein for her recent trip last winter to Moscow to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Russian state propaganda organ. The event included a dinner at which Stein sat at the same dinner table as Putin.

At the same dinner table was seated Donald Trump's military adviser, retired-Gen. Mike Flynn. Flynn was seated directly next to Putin.

More from the Russian Greens:

""After your visit to Moscow and your meeting with Vladimir Putin.... How is it possible to have a discussion with Mr. Putin and not mention, not even once, the fate of Russian political prisoners, or the attacks against Russian journalists, artists, and environmentalists? Is it fair to speak with him about geopolitics and not mention new Russian laws against freedom of speech, restrictions on NGOs and activists, or the shameful law that forbids homosexual propaganda.

From Gupta:

Whether you're a doctor or not, that degree of hyperbole [claiming Trump would be the healthiest president ever] and these types of words being used is very unusual. People don't write like that, that this is 'the healthiest ever.' First of all, they couldn't substantiate. How do you know that someone is the healthiest ever?

There's all sorts of language with that: ""strength and stamina are extraordinary."" What does that mean exactly?

""Astonishingly excellent"" was another term that was used. These just aren't terms that are used by the medical community. So I don't know where they come from.

It says they showed only positive results. Now it's funny in medicine, because when something is good we say it's a negative result. Meaning, that it did not appear when we did an exam. Positive results actually means quite the opposite. Calling things ""test scores"" instead of results. His PSA ""test score"" was this, as if it was the SAT exam instead of a blood test.

Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential candidate, laughed out loud when he heard Donald Trump suggest recently that 95% of the black community would vote for Trump in 2020.

Currently, Trump is polling between 0% and 2% among African-American voters. Even former grand wizard of the KKK, David Duke, is polling higher among blacks.

Trump has been making a big push this week for the black vote, but not for the reason you might think. Trump isn't trying to get African-Americans to vote for him, he's trying to get white people to — and he's using the black community to do it....

Police in Yukon, Oklahoma saved the birthday of a young autistic boy.

Brayden's mom explained that other mothers are uncomfortable being around her son, because he's autistic.

A further update, per CNN, Trump donated a bunch of 'goods' to the relief effort, which is something you should NEVER do. This is exactly what Romney did in 2012. While an amateur might think you don't ""stuff"" to disaster relief, you're supposed to donate money.

And I quote from the Red Cross Web site:

Unfortunately, due to logistical constraints the Red Cross does not accept or solicit individual donations or collections of items. Items such as collected food, used clothing and shoes must be sorted, cleaned, repackaged and transported which impedes the valuable resources of money, time, and personnel.

It is common knowledge that immediately after disasters you don't want presidents — or anyone else with serious security needs — visiting, lest they disrupt the disaster response by sucking away resources for their political photo opp. But that didn't stop Trump.

538.com, one of the best pollsters around, did an analysis yesterday of the recent historical comebacks during presidential elections, and concluded that Hillary Clinton could still lose the election.

Now, yes, Hillary currently has an 88% chance or so of winning. She's doing very well. But as many have noted, it's only the middle of August — the election is in November. Things could change between now and then, and historically, they have changed in several elections.

One final point: Breitbart.

Trump announced yesterday that he was making Stephen Bannon the new head of the Trump campaign. Bannon runs Breitbart, the far-right, alt-right, some say ""white nationalist"" (according to CNN's Brian Stelter) Web site. Breitbart, for those unfamiliar, is basically a really bad blog. Think H.A. Goodman on steroids. Think Ann Coulter, with even more chutzpah and more racism. It cannot be overstated how nutty Breitbart is. They're conservative bomb-throwers, but of the conspiracy wing of the GOP. Even most Republicans don't like them or respect them.

If you thought Trump's campaign was over-the-top and offensive at this point, you ain't seen nothing yet.

We're not talking about someone failing to count the days they've been in the US, and then missing a deadline to leave the country. We're talking about someone who may have deliberately lied about why they came to the US.

To receive a B-1/B-2 visa, you have to indicate on your application and at your interview that you are not coming to the US with the intention to become employed.

This means that, if Melania really did work while on a B-1/B-2 visa (as many have speculated in light of her recently-surfaced modeling photos from the time), there are only two apparent options: 1) She lied on her application and interview when she said she had no intention to work; or 2) A job opportunity arose and she decided not to mention that she was not legally employable.

Cases like Melania's are  not where we should excuse gaffes, particularly not when they seem intentional. And certainly not when they're committed by someone hoping to become the first lady of the most anti-immigration president in modern history.

The Daily Beast is facing a lot of criticism today over a story they published this morning (and have now heavily redacted) about gay Olympic athletes attempting to meet up and hook up with other gay Olympic athletes during the Rio games.

Because of some really sloppy writing and editing — and at best, some incredible naïveté — the Daily Beast story outed several athletes from ""notoriously homophobic"" countries (that last term comes from the author of the story himself, so he knew what he was dealing with).

In a nutshell, a straight reporter (a guy who's married to a woman, and has kids) decided to go on a gay networking app while attending the Olympics, and pretend that he was gay. (His first bad idea, of many.)

He then proceeded to write a voyeuristic piece about trying to find man-on-man sex in the Olympic Village. And in doing so, provided enough detail about the gay Olympians he was chatting me so that anyone could easily figure out their real identity on Google.

Slate's Mark Joseph Stern in fact did just that — Stern quickly identified 5 of the Olympians by name....

Trump knows that. It's just incredibly irresponsible of him to feed these people's paranoia, and lust for violence.

60190486539_10153616670896540,"Why the Khans matter — and how to win an election. 

I've heard from people concerned that we're spending too much time talking about the Khans. I disagree, and here's why....

I've spent much of my career as a crisis communications specialist — usually on the side of creating crises, whether for politicians or business. And one thing I've learned over the years is that you don't always get to pick and choose which issue is going to work against your opponent.

I've had a large number of issues I've worked on go viral over the years. And many were campaigns I'd chosen to work on before they went viral — meaning, for example, I had first decided to push President Obama on ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" and marriage equality, and only later did I find the right levers to push to help the story go viral, and ultimately pressure the President.

Finding those levers, those pressure points, those perfect stories to engage the media, enrage the grassroots, and psych out your target, was a day-by-day process, rather than something we had plotted months, or even weeks, in advance.

It's a common problem with online advocacy. It can be difficult to get someone to finance your work, when you can't 100% spell out the details of the project beforehand. I, for example, am looking for funding to take on Donald Trump over the next three months. But it's difficult to explain in advance exactly what issues I would hit Trump on, and in what manner I'd hit him. For example, would I solely pen cutting blog posts to help shape the media narrative (and what would I write about?), or would my campaign also include publishing a parody of the Trump White House Web site (and I do mean white), with a Russian-language version (that accepts donations in rubles) and a swimsuit competition for the next Supreme Court justice?

It's difficult to know in advance what I'd write about, or what parody sites I might create, because no one can predict which issue is going to hit the public and the media just right in order to go super-viral.

For example, no one could have predicted that the Russians, and then the Khans, would have been the two big issues of the past month, or that the Khans (Muslim-Americans, no less) appear to have caused Trump the most damage yet of this campaign cycle.

And while a good advocacy campaign can attempt to make particular issues go viral, often times a good advocate jumps on an unanticipated issue just as it's cresting and learns to ride, and feed, the viral wave.

That is to say, you can't always get what you want, but sometimes you get what you need....

There's a certain poetry in the fact that potentially the most damaging blow yet to Donald Trump's presidential campaign has come from a Muslim-American named Khan.

As you likely already know, during the Democratic Convention last week, Khizr Khan, and his wife Ghazala, paid homage to their son, U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who died at the age of 27, during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004.

But the Khan's appearance was much more than that.

It was one of the first times that a Trump outrage actually stuck, and seemed to have legs. More so than the time Trump suggested that Mexican immigrants are rapist, and more than the time that Trump mocked a reporter with a disability. This time, the entire country seemed to rally around this humble, grieving family.

And the question is why?

In fact, Obama has used the line repeatedly -- and as recently as two weeks ago in a speech about the Dallas police officers who were murdered -- as have other presidents, which would mean that Trump Jr. plagiarized it from Obama (or at the very least, from previous presidents).

If you've been around politics for a while, you know that primaries are vitriolic. I won't say that our candidates ""lie,"" but they are prone to hyperbole when attacking their fellow Democratic opponents. And you simply have to get by that hyperbole in the fall, when the primaries are over and it's time to take down the Republicans.

Unless your party's candidate is working for America's enemies — Donald Trump's ties to Putin come to mind — or the candidate is calling for, oh I don't know, the mass deportation of an entire class of American citizens simply because of their faith, you have to get over the primaries and start focusing on the greater evil.

And that's ok. Because sometimes elections simply aren't about voting for your favorite candidate, or even a candidate you like. Sometimes elections are about stopping a really bad guy from ruining everything you cared about in the primaries, even if you think the woman running against him ain't that great either.

Now, I happen to think Hillary Clinton is awfully great. But you don't need to agree with me on that point. You simply need to realize that Donald Trump poses a unique danger to our democracy and our values. And that he must be stopped. And if that requires the ten-percenters to hold their nose through November, then so be it. We've all been there.

Oh, but it gets better. Johnson wrote the above piece while he was editor of The Spectator, a British conservative magazine.

If we're ever to advance the national conversation about sensible gun control, then the progressive movement needs to adopt a total economic blockade of the NRA – refusing to do business with ANYONE who does business with the NRA.

We need to demand that the non-profits we support, the associations we belong to and the corporations we patronize stop using firms that serve NRA. Here are a few examples:

·      InfoCision, the NRA's call center company, boasts on their website of also having AT&T, Comcast, Cox, Time Warner, the Communication Workers of America and UNICEF among their clients.

·      Ackerman McQueen, the NRA's Oklahoma City based advertising agency, also has the United Way of Oklahoma City among their clients.

·      Palm Coast Data, of Palm Coast FL, the data processing and magazine fulfillment company that handles the NRA magazine, also provides services to Audubon, Nickleodeon and The Nation.

·      The Georgia World Congress Center, which will host the 2017 NRA Convention, is also hosting the Susan Komen Breast Cancer 3 Day, and many large association conferences.

One of the most important and certainly the most public business partner of the NRA is Visa, the credit card company. The NRA has a partnership with Visa, whereby NRA members can apply for a special Visa card which generates significant revenue for the NRA....

The Republican party today adopted a platform plank in support of anti-gay ""conversion therapy,"" TIME magazine's Zeke Miller reported today.

Conversion therapy is based on the debunked theory that you can ""pray away the gay."" (Hint: You can't.)

The Republicans' embrace of a ""gay cure"" in the party platform comes on the heels of language inserted this morning that in effect bans transgender people from using public bathrooms.

The GOP is fighting quite the anachronistic battle in embracing the notion that you can cure someone's homosexuality. Not only has the practice been debunked and denounced by all the credible medical groups, but it's even been rebuked by many of the very groups that used to practice the ""cure."" In 2011, the world's top ""ex-gay"" confessed that he was still gay. And in 2013, the lead international ""ex-gay"" group, Exodus International, closed its doors and issued a public apology to the gay community.

So it's a little odd that the GOP is today, in 2016, embracing an issue that's already, for all intents and purposes, over.

Toronto Pride ultimately relented — agreeing to, among other things, increased minority representation in Pride and kicking the cops out of future parades and festivals. (Pride parades typically have contingents of LGBT cops and firefighters, and booths set up by the local LGBT officers' group at the accompanying street festival.)

Judging by their success in forcing Toronto Pride to capitulate, I suspect we'll see Black Lives Matter groups protesting more Pride parades in the future. And as a longtime national and international LGBT rights activist, I have a problem with that.

Excerpt:

Deputy Washington Editor of the New York Times, Jonathan Weisman, announced this morning that he is abandoning Twitter as a social media platform after Twitter bizarrely claimed that threatening to kill ""k*kes"" is not a violation of the company's terms of service.

Twitter, like much of the Internet, has become a cesspool of hate. While I still enjoy using Twitter to follow my political contacts, the rest of the service is the realm of virtual superpredators who troll the service, in bands, waiting for someone — usually Jews and women — to pounce on....

Obviously, Weisman's attacker is violating Twitter's rules against ""harassment"" and ""hateful conduct,"" and in addition, the person is clearly making a ""violent threat.""

There's an interesting civil rights law question about Twitter's refusal to police this effort to constructively kick Jews off of the service. If Twitter were a department store, and the store owners made it clear that they had no problem permitting Jews to be routinely forced out of the store by angry mobs, you'd likely have a civil rights lawsuit on your hands.

Now, civil rights laws about public accommodations weren't written with the Internet in mind. You'd like need to update state and federal laws on the subject. But it would be interesting for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division to start an investigation and see whether it has any wiggle room to get involved.

In the meantime, perhaps the ADL, among others, should start asking Twitter's venture capital investors why they feel burning ""k*kes"" in ovens isn't ""violent,"" ""harassment,"" or ""hateful.""

...The fact that America still doesn't have full equality in the corporate boardroom, or in the Oval Office, sends a subtle, or not so subtle, message to young girls and young boys that women are getting better every day, but they're still not up to the big-boy tasks.

What's particularly striking from those who claim the woman card just isn't relevant, is how relevant they find other cards in the deck. These same ""who needs a woman in the White House?"" liberals don't like it when African-Americans or LGBT-Americans are ignored on television (the recently complaints against MSNBC over race come to mind). And they definitely understand the need to have more people of color — and perhaps finally an openly-gay justice? — on the Supreme Court. But when it comes to women in the White House, suddenly diversity is passé.

It was a big deal when we elected an African-American to the presidency eight years ago. Which makes me wonder whether part of the current problem is women themselves.

Why do so many young female Sanders supporters feel that it's no big deal if a woman wins the presidency? In LGBT circles, the phrase ""self-loathing"" comes to mind.

There's a movement of late, especially on college campuses, to redefine American history, and to deep-six a growing number of American historical figures in light of new (or not so new) evidence that many were pretty darn awful on a variety of civil rights issues. I'll limit this discussion to LGBT issues, since, as a longtime national gay rights activist, I'm particularly close to those issues.

Most Americans, most citizens of the world, were terrible on gay rights issues in 1917. (And forget about trans issues.) And while such behavior was abominable, and lots of gay people suffered as a result, I have an issue with entirely ""disqualifying"" the historic achievements of those figures based on their abhorrent actions with regards to gays. Why? Because everyone was bad on our issues back then.

Now, it's a bit more complicated than that. Were, for example, Roosevelt responsible for a genocide against gays, I'd be more upset with any veneration of him. But he wasn't. Still, I fought against anti-gay witch hunts in the US military, so why doesn't this witch-hunt bother me as much?

The answer is ""time.""

I'm still thinking this through, but time matters. Being an anti-gay bigot in 1917 is different from being an anti-gay bigot in 2016, 99 years later. And you don't even have to look back 100 years to find the nuance. Some people criticize Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton for not coming around on gay marriage until 2009 and 2013, respectively.

From Politifact:

Sanders' presidential campaign website says he would ""sign comprehensive immigration reform into law to bring over 11 million undocumented workers out of the shadows.""

However, he wasn't always on that side of the issue. In 2007, when George W. Bush was president, Sanders joined with some conservative Republicans in opposing a comprehensive immigration bill. The bipartisan bill, sponsored by the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., went down in defeat.

At the time, Sanders worried that an influx of legal immigrants would lower wages for workers. ""Sanders was basically one of our only allies … especially for low-skilled workers"" in 2007, Ana Avendano, a former top immigration official at the AFL-CIO, told Politico earlier this year. ""He adamantly put his foot down and said these kinds of programs (allow) employers to bring in more and more vulnerable workers.""

""I wasn't happy when he voted against the bill and I wasn't happy we lost. It hurt,"" immigration-reform advocate Frank Sharry told Politico.

Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Tom Harkin of Iowa joined Sanders in voting against the measure. Clinton, by contrast, voted for the immigration bill, as did then-Sens. Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

Excerpt: And finally, there's a third problem with the quality of journalism, and it's linked in part to the financials. The media is hiring younger and younger writers and TV personalities in order to appeal to a millennial audience, as a last-ditch effort to remain relevant and viable. (Younger people also have lower salary requirements than older folks.) But with that youth and beauty comes a lack of experience. Facebook's Zuckerberg may think young people are simply smarter than their elders, but they're often not as good at what they do as someone with more years' experience. Good writing and good thinking, like any specialty, takes years of experience to learn and perfect. And, even then, you continue to get better with age.

I see publications like Ad Age regularly publishing interesting-sounding digital-age stories that read like a college kid wrote them (and it wasn't always like that). Salon has fallen into the same trap. In order to woo angry and sometimes-naive millennials, Salon has hired far too many angry and sometimes-naive writers. That's not to suggest that there aren't good millennial writers and thinkers (Mic's Gabriel Arana is one), or some good writers at Salon (Amanda Marcotte is one of them).

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is facing yet another outcry from the LGBT community after one of his top campaign aides viciously criticized longtime AIDS activist Peter Staley.

Staley was attacked by the Sanders campaign for joining a group of other top AIDS activists in criticizing Sanders for lying about a recent meeting in which the activists asked Sanders to oppose a drug pricing initiative in California. Sanders left the meeting and immediately issued a press release implying that the activists supported Sanders' call to pass the same initiative they had just asked him to oppose.

In response, the activists — a mix of both Sanders and Clinton supporters — issued a public letter criticizing Sanders for twisting their meeting and using it to help him in the upcoming California primary.

One of Sanders' top campaign officials, Warren Grunnels, responded to the letter on Twitter by attacking Staley, and claiming that the AIDS activist was in the pocket of Big Pharma, which he most certainly is not. This led lead LGBT activist Dan Savage, among others, to leap to Staley's defense.

The California initiative that Sanders is supporting is being sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), an organization that is a vocal critic of the anti-HIV drug PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). Sanders' younger supporters might be surprised to learn of the Senator's cozy relationship with the anti-PrEP movement. Staley said this morning on MSNBC that Sanders' ""big drug companies"" smear came from the anti-PrEP group....

No independent Sanders run or 3rd party Green or Libertarian candidate will stop Trump. Only the Democrats can do that right now. Only them. Provided the party as a whole doesn't f*ck this up, as I already know they can do.

As far as I was concerned, Sanders' narrow win and pick-up of just 6 delegates in Indiana was the final nail in the already sealed coffin. I could support him as long as he was promoting the liberal-populist cause itself. I could no longer support Sanders when it became clear he intends to do as much damage to the Clinton campaign as possible during the next several weeks, and that he apparently had no loyalty to the Democrats at all. They seem to have been just a convenient vehicle for his own ambitions.

I'll be honest here, too: While I supported and was enthusiastic about Senator Bernie Sanders for many months, I never stopped believing Clinton was a perfectly acceptable alternative. Especially given who the GOP is running. I finished off many of my remarks with ""I support Sanders, but I will support whomever the Democrats nominate for President, and every one of their down-ticket candidates this year. Because it's just that important.""

Well, the nominee is just about certain now to be Clinton. So I decided it was time finally to do what I promised to do for all those months: Support the presumptive Democratic party nominee. I just donated to her campaign, for my first time this cycle.

I wish Bernie Sanders well back in the Senate and I hope he continues to fight for his causes.

That's not today's European socialism, whose members don't even really call themselves socialists anymore — they call themselves ""social democrats."" Sound familiar? It almost sounds like what Bernie Sanders calls himself, a ""democratic socialist."" And while the two phrases sound alike, there's a yuge difference between the two. The latter, the one Sanders uses, is much more extreme, and it harkens to a bygone era of far left European socialism that has basically been debunked and rebuked both politically and economically.

Old socialists called for revolutions. New social democrats most certainly do not.

Talking to CNN, Weaver suggested that if Hillary doesn't win the nomination with pledged delegates alone — the delegates you win in the state primaries and caucuses — Sanders will effectively declare a civil war at the Democrat convention this summer....
So what Sanders is in essence now doing is arguing that Hillary no longer needs a majority of the delegates to win the nomination, 
Hillary now needs a supermajority of the pledged delegates. 

Sanders now says that Hillary needs to have 2,383 pledged delegates in order to stop him from contesting the convention. But there are only 4,051 pledged delegates, so a simple majority of those would be 2,026 — not the 2,383 Sanders now says Hillary needs. 2,383 of 4,051 is 59%.

60190486539_10153384404941540,"Bernie Sanders had a disastrous, to quote the Washington Post, meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board yesterday (Monday).

In that interview, Sanders showed that he doesn't have a deep grasp of the issues he's made a mainstay of his campaign, such as banking reform. Faced with detailed questions about his own proposals, Sanders repeatedly told the editorial board ""I don't know"" or he referred to the fact that he didn't have his notes with him.

Sanders was excoriated today by Washington Post political analyst Chris Cillizza....

There's also the undercurrent in all of this that Sanders really believes the public wants to do what he wants to do, and it's only our corporate overlords in Congress who are stopping the proletariat from getting what it wants. So if we can just let the people's voices be heard, Congress will follow.

But what if the people aren't with Bernie Sanders? What if people don't want to see their taxes raised? What if the public starts to have concerns about implementing policies that even President Sanders himself doesn't fully understand? Then what happens?

Not only does Sanders not fully understand his own proposals, but he doesn't appear to know how to get them enacted into law.

60190486539_10153333575996540,"Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told Rachel Maddow last night that his new strategy for victory includes convincing Hillary Clinton's superdelegates to leave her, even if Clinton has more elected or pledged delegates (the delegates you win at the ballot box) by the the time of the Democratic convention in July.

In other words, even if Clinton wins more states, and more actual votes — as she is doing now — Sanders will try to win by superdelegate, and overrule the popular vote.

All of which doesn't sound terribly progressive. Though it does sound like something Castro, Ortega, or the Soviets would do.

And if you think I'm reading this wrong, Sanders' campaign manager Tad Devine admitted the same thing on a phone call with reporters on Wednesday. But Devine went one step further on that call. Sanders may not only target the superdelegates in order to win the nomination if he loses the popular vote, Sanders is arguing that it's also legitimate for him to ask Hillary's pledged delegates — the ones she won in the primaries — to switch to him instead. Jon Green wrote about it two days ago.

According to Miller — in a comment posted on Facebook, which King then shared approvingly with his followers — Bernie Sanders would be winning the Democratic nomination right now if it weren't for ""the rigged [superdelegate] game.""

The not-terribly-objective Miller recommends that Bernie Sanders' supporters ""don't take it,"" and ""rise up.""

Lest anyone think that Dennis Miller is recommending this out of his great love for progressive ideals, Miller has previously claimed that Democrats created the ""birther"" lie, and that President Obama ""has Islamic sympathies."" Miller also suggested that the protester who was sucker-punched at Donald Trump's recent rally shared some of the blame for getting hit in the face. That's who Dennis Miller is.

60190486539_10153328908991540,"Why Merrick Garland is a smart choice for Supreme Court:

It's possible that anyone the President nominates will be so politically tainted by this nomination farce that there's no way they can be renominated again in a future Clinton (or Sanders) administration. If Hillary were to renominate one of the women, or Srinivasan, next year, she'd be accused of playing politics by picking Obama's ""controversial"" election-year pick.

So, Garland, who is roundly considered an excellent, though moderate, jurist, is the best choice once you consider the politics. The goal here is to either get your choice confirmed, or use the confirmation to most help your party and your agenda. If the GOP turns down Orrin Hatch's choice — a man praised by Supreme Court Justice John Roberts — then they'll be showing their hand as angry partisans working on behalf of an angry presidential candidate.

And one more thing. Once the GOP goes all bonkers on Obama's nominee, a nominee as moderate as Garland, it gives a future Democratic nominee an even better chance of being confirmed next year by an already-chastened GOP. Chastened by this year's Supreme Court nomination battle, but also by the fact that their party nominated a nutjob to be their presidential candidate. Republicans will be smarting from their election loss for months. They'll be desperate to prove their moderation. It will be the perfect time for Hillary to appoint a more liberal choice.

""Obama is the guy who hangs out on the North Side of Chicago with wealthy people and he raises money from them,"" Tulchin said.

Rand Paul had a bad interview yesterday.

Like, really bad.

After less than four minutes, Rand had already said that most vaccines should be voluntary, warned viewers that he had ""heard of"" kids developing ""profound mental disorders after vaccines"" and, to top it all off, shushed the anchor when she pressed him for details on his newly-proposed corporate tax holiday....

Libertarianism, at its core, is the idea that society functions best when people can do what they want, keeping as many of their liberties as possible. But what separates libertarianism from straight-up anarchy is the idea that your freedom isn't totally unlimited. Your right to move your fist does eventually end, and it ends at the edge of my nose. As long as you're not hurting anyone you can have all the liberty you want; governments are necessary only to ensure that your actions don't harm your fellow citizens.

And that is exactly why vaccines exist: to make sure your diseases don't spread to others. Protecting the person receiving the vaccine is just an added bonus...

The only way for Senator Paul to square the circle and remain opposed to mandatory vaccinations is to assert, without evidence, that vaccines are in fact dangerous to those being vaccinated. And if he really does believe that, as he intimated, then why did he vaccinate his own kids?

While traveling in England yesterday, Christie said that he thought the government should show ""balance"" between getting kids vaccinated against deadly diseases and parental choice.

Meaning, it's okay if parents choose not to vaccinate their kids, and thus put the rest of us, and our kids, at risk.

Two years ago, Christie showed a similar ambivalence towards science when legislation crossed his desk that would have banned quack doctors from trying to ""cure"" gays.

For starters, it wasn't until 1978, when Mitt Romney was 31 years old, that Mormon leaders had the ""revelation"" that black people were in fact equal to whites, and could therefore fully participate in the religion's rituals and traditions. When pressed by Tim Russert in 2008, Romney expressed personal relief that the policy was changed in 1978, but refused to say that the Church's pre-1978 stance was wrong...

The always-delightful Fox News host Elisabeth Hasselbeck had a breathless report the other day about the deadly Islamic ""no go zones"" that can be found, she claims, all over France — and even in Paris!

Now, let's step back for a moment and think about this. An American TV network is expressing surprise that foreign cities have neighborhoods so dangerous that regular law-abiding people don't dare walk through them.

Yeah, you don't find those in Amurika....

Let me tell you a story about just how dangerous Paris is….
 
I was having dinner a few years back with some English friends, the Wests, in Paris. There kids, ages ranging from 16 to 23 or so, joined us, and it was a good old time. They're a fun family — the parents are English, but the kids were raised in France, so the kids have varying degrees of French-inflected English (their youngest daughter has wonderfully French-accented English).

Anyway, we were having dinner, it was nearly midnight and we were just approaching the cheese course, when one of the kids asked me if life was ""dangerous"" in Washington, DC.  And I thought about it, trying to diplomatic, and explained that it wasn't ""dangerous"" per se, but sure there were certain neighborhoods you ought to avoid at night (and even daytime), and that even in my neighborhood, which is an up-and-coming nook of DC's already-gentrified Adams Morgan quarter, I watch myself walking home at night, but really it's not THAT dangerous, I explained.

Then, I threw in, just as a parenthetical really, that, I mean, it's not like it's safe to walk home alone at 3am or something, but where can you?!

All the kids gasped.

""I walk home alone at 3am all the time in Paris,"" one of the girls told me.

You see, even parts of America that we consider relatively safe are akin to a ""no go"" zone, as compared to life in Paris.

60190486539_10152534465971540,"Are the Charlie Hebdo shooters ""radical"" or simply ""Orthodox""?

From our Jon Green:

....While we call ""radical"" those who read verses 33:61-67 in the Quran as a how-to guide for prosocial behavior, and we call ""orthodox"" those who read 1 Samuel 15:18 as sensible national security policy, both groups are simply reading the words of their sacred texts and following them as best they can. They're both far more devoted than their ""moderate"" counterparts who have rationalized those uncomfortable passages away; but one is called insane and one is called resolute.

Placed in the 21st Century, however, both groups are insane in their resolve. As I've written before (about a Christian, no less), the more seriously you take these religious texts, the less seriously you participate in modern society. Ultra-Orthodox Jews may delay a flight because they refuse to sit next to women, while ultra-Orthodox Muslims sometimes kill people (even other self-described Muslims) for not following their version of their faith. The former is less destructive than the latter, but the principle is the same: God wants us to do this, and we know because he told us so.

Oddly enough, we don't bother coming up with rationalizations for the flight delays the same way we come up with rationalizations for religious terror networks like al-Qaeda. Practically no one says that we need to place the actions of ultra-Orthodox Jews in the proper context.

The candy bar that raised gay-bashing to a commercial art form during the Super Bowl a few years back, has another commercial I just watched that suggests Snickers can (and should) turn a flaming homosexual straight.

(The commercial apparently came out six months ago; I just watched it live on TV for the first time.)

Whoever does Snicker's PR should really be fired at this point. There's a latent homophobia in the company's advertising — advertising that finds gay-bashing funny. And considering that this has happened before, repeatedly, it's likely not a fluke. It's by intent. There's someone high up in Snicker's marketing department who thinks that in 2015 bashing gays is funny.

In the commercial in question, Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel plays a seriously effeminate aerobics instructor who is clearly intended to be flamingly and effeminately gay. He swishes around the room, and his voice is kinda gay too.

Until he eats a Snickers bar...

This time, Panti is speaking at a TED conference about a fear gay people have that straight people never experience: getting gay-bashed for holding hands in public.

It's an amazing, and spot-on, observation. Gay people, in most cities, have to think twice, and then look around, before holding hands or showing any other form of affection in public. Why? Because we might be assaulted verbally or physically.I've only held hands with a guy in public once. It with an Italian guy I was seeing, we were in NYC, and it was around midnight. He was more afraid than I, but we both looked around before daring to hold hands.....

You might not have heard is that a 24 year old employee of that supermarket, Lassana Bathily — a Muslim originally from Mali in west Africa — saved the lives of at least 6, and as many as 20, of the hostages, including an infant.

 When the terrorist entered the store he immediately fired his weapon. A number of the clients in the store ran to the back, and went down some stairs to the basement. Bathily, thinking fast, directed everyone into the store's freezer, then turned off the lights and the refrigeration system....

So at this point, we have a Muslim hero cop who died defending Charlie Hebdo, a Muslim supermarket employee who helped save hostages in a kosher store, and, I'm told, a Muslim police officer who led the raid on the store.

People keeping asking Muslims to speak up.

It's time for our nation (and the world) to have a serious discussion about [insert latest case of religiously-motivated violence here].

Here are a few helpful tips to guide you through this very important story:

.....

3. Keep in mind that the pious people who just shot / bludgeoned / lynched / burned-alive / stabbed / bombed those they had theological differences with, whether or not they were specifically marked for violence or indiscriminately picked at random, didn't do so because of their faith. They did it because they didn't have economic opportunity or educational access or political autonomy (even if they really did).

So the blood is really on our own hands for perpetuating the decades of Western colonialism that drove these people to violence. Any other explanation, ever, is racist — even if the aggressors are themselves white and Western. Don't let anyone, especially not the violent zealots themselves, tell you any different.

.....

7. Also be sure to point out that, while free speech is all fine and good, and a number of innocent people are now dead, including, perhaps, an already-wounded police officer who was then shot in the head, assassination-style, at point-blank range, words hurt too.

So while you certainly don't condone violence, you can at least see where the mass murderers were coming from.

60190486539_10152519923786540,"Some initial thoughts on today's deadly terrorist attack in Paris....

In this case, I'm playing a bit of a devil's advocate. I'm shocked and sickened by the crime, and it's renewed my ongoing concerns about the dogmatic extremism of many modern religions and their followers — particularly Islam. But I also wonder what benefit there is to publishing images of anyone's deity naked. You could argue that it's a blow for free speech, but is it? Is this really the best way to teach uber-conservative religionists about freedom — by turning their deity into a sex object?

I think back to Salman Rushdie, a British novelist who was sentenced to die by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. No one in the West has any sympathy with Iran over that issue. And I have no sympathy with the attackers in Paris today. But I do wonder whether all of these cartoons mocking Muhammad are the same thing, morally and ethically, as what Salman Rushdie did.

Perhaps it all comes down to pornography. Hustler is not ""A Farewell to Arms,"" and the Nazis are most certainly not the VFW, but all are protected by our western notions of freedom of speech. The vileness of the message does not alter the degree to which we protect the messenger. And my gut reaction to the attack in Paris is most certainly not any kind of sympathy with the attackers — the attack has only heightened my ongoing concerns about our tendency to coddle religious extremism. But, I do think it's interesting to think about this issue in terms of how best to respond to intolerance. And I'd welcome some comments below exploring this further.

By 2002, Scalise was, we now know, speaking at a white supremacist conference hosted by none other than former KKK-man, David Duke himself.

Given the revelation that Scalise, now the Republican Majority Whip in the United States House of Representatives, launched his career by winking and nodding at Duke's coalition of pearly-white voters — telling Louisiana journalist Stephanie Grace that he was ""like David Duke without the baggage"" — it's a fair question to ask:

This, after decades of the FDA asking male blood donors if they are gay, and then asking the gay ones whether they have had sex with men at any time since the late 1970s....

I've been through the FDA's gay-blood-interrogation, and it was horrific.

It was the second half of the 1980s, I was very much in the closet, and in law school at Georgetown. I was years away from telling even my best friends that I was gay. There was a blood drive on campus, so I went to donate, not fully aware of the FDA ban.

Some woman I didn't know asked me if I was gay. I was flabbergasted. I suddenly found myself between the Scylla and Charybdis of outing myself to a total stranger — when I had yet to out myself to any straight people anywhere — or lying and giving blood, even though my blood was supposedly at risk of containing HIV, and I might infect a total stranger with what was then a death sentence.
